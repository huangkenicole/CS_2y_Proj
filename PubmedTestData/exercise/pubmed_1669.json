        "This study aimed to describe the prevalence and socio-demographic and lifestyle-related correlates of muscle-strengthening activity (MSA; strength/resistance training, sit-ups/push-ups, etc.) among a large sample of European adolescents.",
        "Data were drawn from the European Health Interview Survey Wave 2 (2013-2014), including 8818 adolescents (15-17 years) from 28 European countries. Self-reported MSA was assessed using a previously validated survey item. Population-weighted prevalence ratios were calculated for (a) 'none' (0 days/week), (b) 'insufficient MSA' (1-2 days/week) or (c) 'sufficient MSA' (\u2a7e3 days/week). Generalised linear models using Poisson regression with robust error variance were used to calculate the prevalence ratios for adolescents reporting sufficient MSA by socio-demographic/lifestyle characteristics and by European region.",
        "Overall, 19.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.3-20.7) reported sufficient (\u2a7e3 days/week) MSA and 57.9% (95% CI 56.4-59.6) reported none. Females, adolescents from Southern and Eastern European regions, those not meeting the aerobic guideline and adolescents classified as overweight were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of reporting sufficient MSA, independent of other characteristics.",
        "<b>The majority of European adolescents do not meet the MSA guidelines. Future large-scale MSA public-health interventions should target female and currently inactive adolescents, as well as those from Southern and Eastern European regions.</b>"
