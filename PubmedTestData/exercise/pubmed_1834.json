        "Exercise programs for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) improve glycemic control and physical function. However, diabetes complications, disability, and motivation pose challenges for exercise participation.",
        "The purpose of the study was to: 1) measure change in fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, anthropometrics (i.e. BMI and waist circumference), and physical function (i.e. endurance, agility and balance, upper and lower-body strength and flexibility) after completing an eight-week education and exercise program for adults with T2D; and 2) explore the experience of exercise continuation in people living with T2D at one-year follow-up.",
        "A mixed methods case series design was conducted. Participants were \u2265 18\u00a0years and had a clinical diagnosis of T2D (glycated hemoglobin (A1C) \u2265 6.5%). Participants completed two one-hour exercise sessions and one one-hour education session per week for eight weeks. Blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and physical function were measured at baseline and after completing the program. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at one, six, and 12-months and thematic analysis was employed to analyze interviews.",
        "Twelve participants completed the program. Clinically significant improvements were observed for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, six-minute walk test (6MWT), timed up-and-go test (TUG), 30-second chair stand test (CST) and arm curls. Three themes emerged from the interviews that described participant reflections and experiences with a supervised education and exercise program for management of their T2D: 1) medical management; 2) lifestyle management; and 3) finding what works. <b>Conclusion</b>: Supervised programming improves physical function and may mitigate disability. Physiotherapists are qualified to assess and treat physical function through education and exercise."
