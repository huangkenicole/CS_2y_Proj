        "To investigate the effect of high-intensity exercise on emotional distress, fatigue, and ability to do a full day's activities in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).",
        "A total of 28 physically inactive axSpA patients were randomized to either an exercise group (EG), which performed 12\u00a0weeks of cardiorespiratory and strength exercises, or a control group (CG), which received treatment as usual. The outcomes reported in this paper are secondary outcomes in the trial and included emotional distress (General Health Questionnaire-12, 0-36, 36\u00a0=\u00a0worst), fatigue [numeric rating scale (NRS), 0-10, 10\u00a0=\u00a0worst], and ability to do a full day's activities (NRS, 0-10, 10\u00a0=\u00a0worst). Post-intervention differences were assessed by analysis of covariance with baseline values as covariates.",
        "Twenty-four patients were included in the analyses. All patients in the EG followed the exercise protocol. The EG had a statistically significant beneficial effect [mean group differences (95% confidence interval)] on emotional distress [-5.8, (-9.7, -1.9), p\u00a0<\u00a00.01], fatigue [-2.4, (-4.3, -0.4), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02], and ability to do a full day's work [-2.2, (-3.9, -0.4), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02] compared to the CG.",
        "This pilot study showed promising effects of cardiorespiratory and strength exercises on emotional distress, fatigue, and ability to do a full day's activities in patients with axSpA. The findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial."
