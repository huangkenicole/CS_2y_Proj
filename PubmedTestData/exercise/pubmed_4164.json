        "The present study investigated the efficacy of a program of aerobic exercise on pulmonary functions in adult males with hemophilia A (HA).",
        "40 patients with HA who met the eligibility criteria (40 HA; age range: 20-39 years) were invited to participate in the study. The patients were divided into two groups, 20 per each. Participants in the study group (A) underwent selected physical therapy program, along with aerobic training sessions on a cycle ergometer (50-60% heart rate reserve, moderate intensity), while the control group (B) underwent a selected physical therapy program only. The pulmonary functions (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, PIF, and MVV) were measured before and after treatment program.",
        "There were noteworthy statistical differences between pre- and post-measurements in the study group in all measured variables (p < 0.05). There were also significant statistical differences between the study and control groups in all measured variables post treatment (p < 0.05).",
        "This study has demonstrated that hemophilic A patients' pulmonary functions have improved significantly following aerobic exercise training. As a result, aerobic exercise can be used in addition to medical treatment for hemophilic A patients."
