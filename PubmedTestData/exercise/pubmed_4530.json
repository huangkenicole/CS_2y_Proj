      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to explore the relationship between physical exercise (PE) and mobile phone dependence (MPD) in Chinese university students and verify the potential role of self-control (SC) in mediating the decrease of MPD by PE. Through the quota sampling, 608 students that complied with the requirements were surveyed from 10 universities in China. PE, MPD, and SC were assessed using standard scales. For data analysis, t-tests, correlation analysis, hierarchical regression, and regression analysis were carried out in turn. The results showed significant gender differences in PE, MPD, and SC. For male students, the level of PE and score of SC were higher than those in females, yet the MPD score was lower. PE and SC were negatively related to MPD (<i>r</i> = -0.124, <i>p</i> < 0.01; <i>r</i> = -0.563, <i>p</i> < 0.001), so both could remarkably predict MPD (<i>\u03b2</i> = -1.00, <i>p</i> < 0.05; <i>\u03b2</i> = -0.552, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Gender was also a significant predictor for MPD (<i>\u03b2</i> = 0.089, <i>p</i> < 0.05). PE could, to some extent, decrease MPD, in which SC played a significant mediating role-its mediating effect accounted for nearly 71% of the total effect. The present study shows that PE is negatively correlated with MPD, and SC mediates the decrease of MPD by PE for university students in China. This indicates that the improvement of SC by PE could be a highly trustworthy and practicable way to effectively address the issue of MPD in university students or other young people across the world."
