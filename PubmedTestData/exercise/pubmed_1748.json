        "Breast cancer treatment may be a cause of postural disorders.",
        "Assessment of the effects of various forms of physical activity on body posture in the sagittal plane in women post breast cancer treatment.",
        "Sixty women who had received breast cancer treatment. The study group was intentionally divided into three groups of 20 women who followed different exercise regimens: NordicWalking (NW), water resistance exercise (WE) or general fitness exercise (GE).",
        "Photogrammetric examination of body posture using a Computer-Based Body Posture Diagnostics apparatus performed at baseline and after an 8-week regimen of appropriately selected physical exercise.",
        "A favourable tendency for the shallowing of thoracic kyphosis and the reduction of lumbar cu rvature of the spine was noted in the NW group. Reduced kyphosis was also noted in the WE group, however it was accompanied by more pronounced lumbar lordosis and a tendency for excessive forward bending of the trunk. In the GE group, on the other hand, no significant differences were observed in terms of the shape of anteroposterior spinal curvatures.",
        "The diversity observed in the shape of anteroposterior spinal curvatures following physical training regimens of different type and nature demonstrates the need of appropriate exercise selection to attain the desired therapeutic outcome. Balanced postural changes were only identified among the women in the NW group. In the GE group, however, training only sustained the status existing prior to the initiation of the exercise regimen."
