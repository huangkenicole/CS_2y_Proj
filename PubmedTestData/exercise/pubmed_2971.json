      "AbstractText": [
        "Balance impairments are the leading causes of falls in older adults. Aquatic-based exercises have been broadly practiced as an alternative to land-based exercises; however, the effects on dynamic balance have not been comprehensively reviewed and compared to land exercises. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the effectiveness of aquatic exercises (AE) to land exercises (LE) on dynamic balance in older adults.",
        "Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, psycINFO), from inception to November 2019, were searched. Studies met the following eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials, English language, older adults aged 65\u2009years or older, a minimum of one AE and LE group, at least one assessment for dynamic balance. For the meta-analysis, the effect sizes of dynamic balance outcomes were calculated using a standardized mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence interval (CI).",
        "A total of 11 trials met the inclusion criteria, and 10 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis presented that older adults in AE groups demonstrated comparable enhancements in dynamic steady-state balance (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.24; 95% CI, -.81 to .34), proactive balance (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.21; 95% CI, -.59 to .17), and balance test batteries (SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.24; 95% CI, -.50 to .03) compared with those in LE groups.",
        "AE and LE have comparable impacts on dynamic balance in older adults aged 65\u2009years or older. Thus, this review provides evidence that AE can be utilized as a reasonable alternative to LE to improve dynamic balance and possibly reduce the risk of falls."
