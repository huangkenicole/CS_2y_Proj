      "AbstractText": [
        "(1) Background-The application of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) combined with low-intensity exercise to the elderly can be more efficient than low-intensity exercise only in terms of delaying the loss of muscle mass. We aimed to assess the adjunct of NMES to low-intensity lower limb strengthening exercise to prevent falls in frail elderly for a relatively short period of 4 weeks. (2) Methods-Thirty elderly women aged 65 or above were randomly categorized into three groups: control group (CON, <i>n</i> = 8), exercise group (EX, <i>n</i> = 10), and NMES with exercise group (EX + NMES, <i>n</i> = 9). The exercise group took part in a lower limb strengthening exercise program for one hour three times a week for four weeks. Furthermore, the NMES with exercise group had added NMES stimulation when exercising. The limbs' muscle mass, body fat mass, calf circumference, grip force, five times sit-to-stand test, timed up-and-go test (TUG), one-leg stand test, and Y-balance test (YBT) were evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after. (3) Results-Comparisons between the three groups showed that the TUG was significantly decreased and the YB was significantly increased in NMES with exercise group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). (4) Conclusions-These results suggested that a combination of NMES stimulation and exercises was more helpful in strengthening balance than exercises alone in the short term."
