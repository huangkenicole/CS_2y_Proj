        "All patients living with cancer, including those with metastatic cancer, are encouraged to be physically active. This paper examines the secondary endpoints of an aerobic exercise intervention for men with metastatic prostate cancer.",
        "ExPeCT (Exercise, Prostate Cancer and Circulating Tumour Cells), was a multi-centre randomised control trial with a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention arm or a standard care control arm. Exercise adherence data was collected via heart rate monitors. Quality of life (FACT-P) and physical activity (self-administered questionnaire) assessments were completed at baseline, at 3\u00a0months and at 6\u00a0months.",
        "A total of 61 patients were included (69.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0yr, body mass index 29.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The median time since diagnosis was 34\u00a0months (IQR 7-54). A total of 35 (55%) of participants had\u2009>\u20091 region affected by metastatic disease. No adverse events were reported by participants. There was no effect of exercise on quality of life (Cohen's d\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.082). Overall adherence to the supervised sessions was 83% (329 out of 396 possible sessions attended by participants). Overall adherence to the non-supervised home exercise sessions was 72% (months 1-3) and 67% (months 3-6). Modelling results for overall physical activity scores showed no significant main effect for the group (p-value\u2009=\u20090.25) or for time (p-value\u2009=\u20090.24).",
        "In a group of patients with a high burden of metastatic prostate cancer, a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention did not lead to change in quality of life. Further exercise studies examining the role of exercise for people living with metastatic prostate cancer are needed.",
        "The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02453139) on May 25th 2015."
