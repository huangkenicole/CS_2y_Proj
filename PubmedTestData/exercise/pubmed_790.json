        "To describe a novel 3-dimensional (3D) exergames system and the results of a clinical feasibility study of stroke survivors needing in-home rehabilitation.",
        "The customisable Personalized In-home eXErgames for Rehabilitation (PIXER) system captures the user's image, generates a live model, and incorporates it into a virtual exergame. PIXER provides a recording system for home exercise programs (HEPs) by adapting virtual objects, customizes the exergame and creates a digital diary. Ten persons with stroke, performed HEPs with PIXER for 1\u2009month, and without PIXER for 2 additional months. In-game performance data, measures of physical functioning (PF) including Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Timed Up & Go (TUG) and Goal Attainment (GA) Scale obtained at baseline, 1- and 3\u2009months were evaluated.",
        "Seventy percent of participants completed the 1-month timepoint, 50% completed all timepoints. In-game data: Number of repetitions completed; Anomalies reported; and Percentage of bubbles hit showed positive trends. Compared to baseline, all SIS physical functioning (PF) scores were higher at 1\u2009month, TUG scores showed no overall improvement and GA scale scores were 77% at 3\u2009months.",
        "It is feasible for community-dwelling patients to perform HEP after stroke using PIXER, a novel, exergames system, and potentially improve their function.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHome Exercises performed using a novel, 3-dimensional, customizable Personalized In-home eXErgames for Rehabilitation (PIXER) system is feasible for community-dwelling patients after stroke.In-game performance data obtained in this clinical pilot study showed positive trends of improvement in several study participants.PIXER has potential to improve functional outcomes for community-dwelling adults with stroke."
