        "Sedentary behavior is widespread among older adults and accelerates the decline of motor function. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence concerning the effectiveness of regular exercise in enhancing the same in sedentary older adults.",
        "To compare the effects of 24 weeks of aerobic and combined aerobic-resistance exercise on the motor function of sedentary older adults.",
        "Sixty healthy sedentary older (65-80 years) were randomly enrolled. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups (1:1:1): aerobic exercise group (AEG), combined aerobic-resistance exercise group (CEG), and health education group (HEG). The training group underwent a five-day-a-week regimen, with each session lasting for 40 minutes (including 10 min warm-up and cool-down). HEG received only monthly health lectures. We assessed lower limb muscle strength (30-second sit-to-stand ability), single-dual task gait, static and dynamic balance functions at baseline and after 24 weeks of intervention using per-protocol analysis.",
        "Among 60 elderly healthy who were randomized (mean age 70.59 \u00b1 3.31 years; 28 women (46%)), 42 (70%) completed the evaluation after 24 weeks. Both the aerobic exercise and combined aerobic-resistance exercise groups exhibited improved 30-second sit-to-stand ability, static balance in closed-eye standing mode, and dynamic balance (P< 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant changes in the single-task gait parameters of stride length, stride width, and stride speed (P> 0.05). Additionally, compared to the aerobic exercise group, the combined exercise group showed an increase in dual-task gait speed and medial and lateral dynamic stability indices (P< 0.05).",
        "Both the aerobic exercise and combined aerobic-resistance exercise programs are effective in enhancing lower limb muscle strength, dynamic balance, and static balance while standing with eyes closed in sedentary older adults. Furthermore, the combined aerobic-resistance exercise program is more effective in improving dual-task gait speed as well as medial and lateral dynamic balance."
