        "<b>Background:</b> Physical activity, including aerobic exercise, is highly recommended for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients to improve pain intensity and functional disability. <b>Objectives:</b> To assess the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises to reduce pain intensity and functional disability in patients with CLBP. <b>Methods:</b> A computer-aided search was performed to find Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises in CLBP. Articles published between January 2007 to December 2020 were included in the review. Quality assessment using the PEDro scale, extraction of relevant information, and evaluation of outcomes were done by two reviewers independently. <b>Results:</b> A total of 17 studies were included that involved 1146 participants. Outcomes suggested that aerobic exercise combined with other interventions was more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Aerobic exercise with higher frequency (\u2265 5 days/week) and longer duration (\u2265 12 weeks) were effective to gain clinically significant (\u2265 30%) improvements. Environment and using pedometer did not seem to influence the outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pain intensity and functional disability in CLBP patients can be minimized by prescribing aerobic exercise. However, to get better improvements, aerobic exercise should be done in combination with other interventions and at optimum frequency and duration. Further studies should emphasize examining the optimal doses and duration of different aerobic exercises."
