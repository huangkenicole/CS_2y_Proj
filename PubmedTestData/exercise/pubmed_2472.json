        "The present study aimed to determine the effect of mental fatigue (MF) on total training volume (TTV; number of repetitions x number of sets x load) and on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE; Borg, 1982) in the half-back squat exercise (HBSE). Nine male subjects (<i>M</i> age\u2009=\u200922.6\u2009years, <i>SD\u2009=\u2009</i>\u20092.3; <i>M</i> height\u2009=\u2009172.3\u2009cm<i>, SD\u2009=\u2009</i>\u20096.8; <i>M</i> weight\u2009=\u200976.2\u2009kg<i>, SD\u2009=\u2009</i>\u20099.8; <i>M</i> years of resistance training experience\u2009=\u20094.1, <i>SD</i>\u2009=\u20092.3\u2009years) recruited from a university population were study participants in this participant-blind cross-over and randomized study. Participants underwent either the Stroop task - a highly demanding cognitive task (CT) - or a control condition (CON) in which they viewed a documentary exhibition for 30\u2009minutes. Perception of MF and motivation were assessed after treatments using a visual analog scale of 100\u2009mm. Participants then engaged in a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and three sets of HBSE until they reached momentary concentric failure, reporting RPE at the end of each exercise set. Following the CT, participants showed a significantly increased self-perception of MF in relation to the CON condition (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01; <i>d</i>\u2009=\u20091.2), but this did not affect their motivation to engage in subsequent tests (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.99; <i>d</i>\u2009=\u20090.006). Neither the CMJ performances nor the RPE were statistically different between CT and CON conditions (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.33; <i>d</i>\u2009=\u20090.09 and <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.20<i>; \u03b7<sup>2</sup></i>\u2009=\u20090.20, respectively). TTV was significantly lower in the CT relative to the CON experimental condition (\u0394\u2009=\u2009-15.8%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04; <i>\u03b7<sup>2</sup></i>\u2009=\u20090.48). Prolonged involvement in a CT was associated with reduced volume on a resistance exercise, though this effect was not associated with changes in CMJ performance or motivation to exercise."
