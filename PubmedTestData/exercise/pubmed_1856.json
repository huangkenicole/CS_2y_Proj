        "Hamstring injury prevention programs include strengthening, especially eccentric exercises using both gravitational and inertial loading. Inertial exercises are characterized by eccentric contractions of high intensity and velocity. This study aimed to analyze the muscular activation of the biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), gluteus maximus (GM), and gracilis (GC) muscles during hip extension (HE) exercises performed under both gravitational and inertial loading conditions.",
        "Inertial training would generate a greater activation of HE muscles than gravitational training.",
        "Cross-sectional study.",
        "Level 4.",
        "Fifteen resistance-trained men performed the unilateral straight knee bridge (SKB), 45\u00b0 of HE, and stiff-leg deadlift (SDL) exercises under gravitational and inertial loading conditions. Concentric and eccentric phases were identified with a linear encoder. Differences between load types, exercises, and their interaction were examined to establish the electromyographic (EMG) activity of each muscle and BF/ST ratio.",
        "In the concentric phase, inertial loading showed a higher normalized EMG than gravitational loading for BF, ST, and GM. SKB and HE activated BF and ST between 9.6% and 24.3% more than SDL. In the eccentric phase, the inertial modality achieved greater GM activation than the gravitational form (18.1%). BF activation was increased with HE and SKB as compared with SDL (24.4% and 16.4%, respectively), while ST activation was likewise enhanced with HE as compared with SDL (15.1%).",
        "Inertial training is more effective than gravitational training for the concentric activation of the hamstring muscles while SDL showed lower hamstring activation than HE and SKB. Therefore, HE and SKB with inertial loading should be taken into account in hamstring training programs.",
        "Inertial training is more effective than gravitational training for the concentric activation of the hamstring muscles. HE and SKB with inertial loading should be taken into account in hamstring training programs."
