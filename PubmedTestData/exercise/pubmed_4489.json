      "AbstractText": [
        "Drawing on self-determination theory, this study examined how motivation to engage in physical activity (PA) influences the observance of PA recommendations by adults with type 2 diabetes.",
        "This study used a cross-sectional design. In total, 365 adults with type 2 diabetes (181 men and 184 women, mean age\u2009=\u200960.39 years; SD=6.47) completed a questionnaire assessing their motivations and behaviours regarding PA. PA behaviour was assessed by means of the weekly practice of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during leisure time. A symptom checklist was also used to assess diabetes-related symptoms experienced over the past month.",
        "Results of a hierarchic binary logistic regression revealed that participants accumulating at least 150 minutes per week of MVPA during their leisure time were more likely to display higher scores on intrinsic and identified motives, whereas participants not accumulating 150 minutes per week of MVPA during their leisure time were more likely to present higher scores on external regulation and amotivation. In addition, results of a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that participants accumulating at least 150 minutes per week of MVPA during their leisure time experienced less fatigue and fewer hyperglycemic symptoms.",
        "These findings suggest that adults who observe PA recommendations for type 2 diabetes possess higher levels of autonomous motives to practise PA. Results further highlight the importance of motives for engaging in PA by adults with type 2 diabetes in terms of the positive relationship between observing PA recommendations and experiencing less fatigue and fewer hyperglycemic symptoms."
