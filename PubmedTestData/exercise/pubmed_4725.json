        "Although physical activity (PA) improves the physical, mental, and social outcomes of people living with HIV (PLH), multiple barriers prevent them from exercising. In this systematic review, we investigated the effect of home-based interventions to promote physical activity (HBI) among PLH. Randomised trials and quasi-experimental studies published in English until March 2020 were sought in five databases. Independent reviewers performed data extraction, risk of bias assessment and pragmatic-explanatory (PRECIS-2) evaluation of study characteristics. Outcomes included engagement in PA, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, metabolic disturbances, and quality of life (QoL). Out of 480 retrieved references, six studies met inclusion criteria. Interventions lasted 12-48 weeks and involved 400 individuals (57.8% women). Ninety-eight (24.5%) participants completed interventions, but dropout rates varied considerably (5.0-54.5%). Resulted showed increased PA (two studies) and improved cardiorespiratory fitness or strength (three and two studies, respectively). Four studies demonstrated reduction of waist circumference and increase in lean body mass. QoL improved in two of three studies. We conclude HBI (aerobic and/or resistance exercises) may contribute to improve PA and/or cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, strength and QoL of PLH. Further investigation using multi-centre standardised protocols is warranted to provide stronger evidence of their effectiveness in health promotion for PLH."
