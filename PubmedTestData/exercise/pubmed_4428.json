        "Evidence is accumulating for the potential benefits of technology use in stroke rehabilitation. However, few studies have examined ways in which technology can be used to increase adherence to programs after discharge from rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine if the addition of concurrent visual feedback, via a tablet computer, increased adherence to an exercise program following stroke. Ten participants were provided with a self-administered exercise program and were asked to perform 60\u00a0min of the exercises daily. After a baseline phase (1\u00a0week), participants were given a tablet computer (2\u00a0weeks) and were asked to video record each exercise session. The tablet computer was removed during the fourth week of the program.",
        "Exercise duration, measured via wrist-worn accelerometry, was investigated over the 4\u00a0weeks using the two-standard deviation (2 SD) band method. A statistically significant effect was observed in four out of ten cases, demonstrated by two successive data points occurring outside the 2 SD band during the intervention phase, suggesting that adherence was increased in response to the tablet computer use. This preliminary study indicates that the use of visual feedback, via a tablet computer, may increase adherence to an exercise program in people with stroke.
