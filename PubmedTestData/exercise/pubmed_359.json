        "<b>Purpose</b>: Even though multiple training methods appear to be effective to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, they also need to be perceived as tolerable or enjoyable by exercisers to maximize long-term behavioral maintenance. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare perceived enjoyment between whole-body interval training (SIT-WB), treadmill-based interval training (SIT-T) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). <b>Method</b>: Forty-one healthy adult men (age: 23.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.7\u00a0years, height: 1.79\u00a0\u00b1 0.01 m, body mass: 78.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.7 kg; VO<sub>2max</sub>: 46.7\u00a0\u00b1 7.3\u00a0ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>) were randomly assigned to SIT-WB, SIT-T, or MICT and underwent 16\u00a0weeks of training (3x/w). SIT-WB and SIT-T completed eight 20 s bouts interspersed by 10 s passive recovery, differing as to the exercise mode performed (i.e., calisthenics exercises and treadmill running, respectively) whereas MICT participants ran for 30\u00a0min at an intensity below the second ventilatory threshold. Perceived enjoyment was assessed 10\u00a0min post-exercise at weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 16, using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. <b>Results</b>: Compliance was high (~90%) across all three training groups (<i>p</i> = .803). All training modes were rated as enjoyable and no significant within- (F<sub>(4, 152)</sub>\u00a0= 1.132, <i>p</i> = .344) or between-group (F<sub>(2, 38)</sub>\u00a0= 0.662, <i>p</i> = .521) differences were found during the intervention period. <b>Conclusions</b>: These results suggest that SIT-WB can be employed as an enjoyable low-cost alternative to traditional treadmill-based SIT and MICT for up to 16\u00a0weeks."
