        "The Pilates exercises are popular for muscle conditioning among women. However, the effects on conditioning of healthy non-active adult women due to Pilates practicing are not fully explained. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effects of equipment-based Pilates exercises on the percentage of body fat, weight, body mass index (BMI), functional capacity, and quality of life of adult healthy women.",
        "Seventy-eight non-active women were randomly assigned to 2 groups (Pilates or Control). The Pilates group performed a total of 16 exercise sessions (60 minutes each, performed twice a week for 8 consecutive weeks). The control group was instructed to perform no exercise. Percentage of body fat (DXA scans), weight, BMI, distance covered in the incremental shuttle walk test, maximal oxygen uptake (VO<inf>2max</inf>), and quality of life (SF-36 scores) were analyzed.",
        "There were no significant between-group differences at baseline, but significant group-by-time interaction was observed for Pilates group postintervention. Higher distance covered (P=0.01), VO<inf>2max</inf> (P=0.04), and quality of life (P=0.04) were observed after the intervention compared to the control group. No differences were observed for body composition.",
