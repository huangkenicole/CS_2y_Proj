        "To compare the effect of multicomponent and resistance training and detraining on cognition and depressive symptoms in oldest-old community-dwelling people.",
        "A total of 69 sedentary older adults aged older than 80\u2009years were assessed and randomized into three groups (control, multicomponent and resistance training). The multicomponent group performed protocol consisting of aerobic, strength and balance exercises. The resistance group participated in strength exercises using six machines. The control group did not perform any intervention. The training sessions had progressive intensity, lasted 16\u2009weeks and included three sessions per week. The volunteers were assessed at baseline, at the end of the 16-week training sessions and after the 6-week detraining period. The assessment consisted of anamneses, Geriatric Depression Scale and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Test, verbal fluency and dual task).",
        "There were no significant differences between groups and times in any of variables; however, the adherence to training was low, mainly in the multicomponent group.",
        "Randomized controlled trials using adherence strategies and longer times comparing training variations are required to verify which training protocols are more effective and consistent on cognition and depression in oldest-old people."
