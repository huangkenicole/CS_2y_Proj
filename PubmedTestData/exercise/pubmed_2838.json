        "Strength exercise training is advised for people with hemophilia (PWH); however, few studies have been published and have methodological limitations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of progressive elastic resistance training on quality of life and perceived functional abilities in PWH.",
        "Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n\u00a0=\u200910) or control (n\u00a0=\u200910) group. The intervention group performed progressive moderate-vigorous elastic resistance training (2\u2009days/week, a total of 8\u2009weeks), focusing on the muscles of the knee, elbow, and ankle joints. The control group continued its usual daily activities for 8\u2009weeks. Quality of life (A36 Hemofilia-QoL\u00ae) and perceived functional abilities (Haemophilia Activities List) were assessed at baseline and an 8-week follow-up.",
        "The intervention group improved the quality-of-life dimension of joint damage perception in comparison to the control group (p\u00a0=\u2009.015, large effect size). Regarding perceived functional abilities, the intervention group improved lying, sitting, kneeling, and standing (p\u00a0=\u2009.006, small effect size), and complex lower extremities activities (i.e., walking short and long-distance, and up-down stairs) (p\u00a0=\u2009.006, small effect size) compared to the control group. No other significant differences were observed.",
        "Eight weeks of progressive moderate-vigorous elastic resistance training in PWH improve the quality-of-life dimension of joint damage perception and perceived functional abilities (lying/sitting/kneeling/standing, and complex lower extremities activities). Our results suggest a limited effect of the program on the other items of quality of life measured by the questionnaire as emotional functioning, mental health, and social relationships. Importantly, no serious adverse effects occurred."
