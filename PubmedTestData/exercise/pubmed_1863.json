        "Physical exercise has been shown to have a variety of health-promoting effects, including improvements in cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, symptoms and risk factors such as LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations. Regular physical exercise may slow down or even reverse the progression of various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Despite the overwhelming evidence, physical exercise is not comprehensively used as a treatment component either in primary care or in hospital settings.",
        "The outpatient Sports and Exercise Medicine Clinic (SEMC) is the first specialized clinic in Finland to use physical exercise as a part of the public health care system. Patients needing specialist attention due to NCDs, usually combined with sedentary lifestyles, are referred to the clinic.",
        "The prerequisites for patient referral are the known efficacy of physical exercise intervention in the treatment of disease and the need for sports and exercise medicine expertise. The focus of the clinic is to implement physical activity into daily life with other health-promoting habits such as diet, rest and the reduction of substance use. In addition, SEMC promotes the inclusion of physical exercise in several local treatment guidelines in the hospital district. The advisory treatment protocol of SEMC consists of a baseline evaluation, face-to-face visits with a physician and/or physiotherapist at 3, 6 and 9-12\u00a0months, and contacts via phone between hospital visits. Laboratory tests, body composition, walking tests, and measurements of muscle strength and balance are performed at baseline, and body composition and physical tests are repeated after 6 and 9-12\u00a0months.",
        "At the core of the treatment is individualization, using motivational interviewing, considering the patients' personal interests and resources, and encouraging the patient to be an active member of our multi-professional team. We reported the first results in the SEMC with future development plans for the clinic."
