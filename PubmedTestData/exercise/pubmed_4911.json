        "A questionnaire measuring life satisfaction, self-rated physical exercise and self-perceptions were mailed to persons with incomplete SCI.",
        "In total, 100 questionnaires were sent out and 69 respondents were included in the study. Of those, 68% performed physical activity regularly once or more a week. Participants who were exercising regularly once a week or more scored significantly higher on the summed life satisfaction scale (P=0.002) and on perceived fitness (P=0.004), but significantly lower on perceived exercise mastery (P=0.012) than those who were non-exercisers.",
        "Participants in this study with incomplete SCI who exercised regularly experienced a significantly higher life satisfaction and perceived exercise fitness, but lower perceived exercise mastery than their inactive peers. Perceived exercise fitness was the psychological variable that contributed meaningfully to life satisfaction in this study."
