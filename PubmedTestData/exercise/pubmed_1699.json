        "Osteoporosis is a systemic disease characterized by the increase of bone fragility and fracture risk. Postmenopausal female osteoporotic patients were randomized into three groups: balance and coordination, strengthening, and aerobic exercise. The exercise programs were performed for 12 weeks, 1 hr each day for 3 days of the week. Patients were followed-up for 12 weeks after the initial intervention. After the exercise program, patients continued their daily life activities and were called back to the clinic for additional testing after 12 weeks. Static and dynamic balance measurements and pain and life quality assessments were performed at enrollment, and at the 12th and 24th weeks. Significant improvements in both the Timed Up and Go test and Berg Balance Scale values at the 12th week were only observed in the balance-coordination group. There were statistically significant improvements in night and daytime pain visual analog scale scores at the 12th and 24th weeks in the strengthening exercise group. No patient experienced falling during the 24th week follow-up. The strengthening exercises were observed to be more effective in pain reduction, and balance and coordination exercises were found to be more effective in improvement of static and dynamic balance."
