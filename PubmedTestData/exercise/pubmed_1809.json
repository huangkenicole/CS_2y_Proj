        "Exercise training such as balance, aerobic, and resistance training is able to improve physical functioning of older adults. Delivering such exercise regimes at home without supervision may be useful for older adults because they do not have to leave their homes.",
        "This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to establish the effect of unsupervised home-based exercise training regimes on physical functioning (balance and muscle strength) in older adults.",
        "PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases and reference lists of included investigations were searched.",
        "Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise training impact on balance and upper body strength with concurrent control groups were included in the analysis.",
        "Our analyses revealed that in older adults, unsupervised home-based various exercise training was effective in improving measures of proactive balance (mean difference (MD) = -1.37 s; 95% confidence interval (CI), -2.24, -0.51 s; <i>p =</i> 0.002) and balance test battery (MD: 1.80; 95% CI, 0.46, 3.14 s; <i>p =</i> 0.009). There were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups for upper body strength (<i>p</i> > 0.05).",
        "Unsupervised home-based exercise training improves balance in older adults. Future investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying unsupervised home-based exercise training's effect on this population's physical functioning outcomes."
