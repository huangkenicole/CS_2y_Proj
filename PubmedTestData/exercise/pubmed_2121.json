        "Regular physical activity is widely recommended for patients with arterial hypertension as an essential component of lifestyle modification. Much less is known about the impact of physical exercise on the management of treatment of resistant hypertension (RH). The aim was to assess the effect of physical activity program intensified by mobile phone text reminders on blood pressure control in subjects with RH managed in the primary care.",
        "In total, 53 patients with primary hypertension were qualified, including 27 who met the criteria for RH and 26 with well-controlled hypertension (WCH). Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure was monitored and body composition evaluated with bioimpedance and habitual physical activity profile was determined continuously over 72 h with accelerometer. All measurements were performed at baseline and after three and six months. The patients were asked to modify their lifestyle according to American Heart Association Guidelines that included regular aerobic physical activity tailored to individual needs.FindingsPhysical activity in RH increased significantly after six months compared with control subjects (P=0.001). Office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the RH group decreased significantly after three months but after six months only office DBP remained significantly lower. After three months 24-h SBP decreased by 3.1\u00b111 mmHg (P=0.08) and DBP by 2.0\u00b16 mmHg (P=0.17) in RH, whereas in WCH respective changes were +1.2\u00b110 and -0.3\u00b16 mmHg. After six months 24-h BP changes were similar.",
