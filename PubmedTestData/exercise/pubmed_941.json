        "This study explored the effects of partly supervised physical exercise program (PSPEP) intervention compared to fully supervised physical exercise program (FSPEP) on cognitive functions, movement proficiency and problematic internet use (PIU) in adolescents presenting combined unhealthy lifestyle behaviors.",
        "Over a period of 16 weeks the PSPEP group (n = 14) engaged in strength, balance and flexibility exercises three times per week with one supervised session and two unsupervised. The FSPEP group (<i>n</i> = 13) practiced dance activities for 2 to 4 days per week including in training sessions the same exercises as for the PSPEP group. Prior and after the study adolescents completed the PIU scale, performed movement proficiency and cognitive function tests.",
        "The PSPEP had significant effect on improvement of stress tolerance (<i>p</i> < 0.01, g = 1.08), while the FSPEP had significant effect on contributing general intelligence (<i>p</i> < 0.05, g = 0.90), color-word interference of the reading speed or color recognition (<i>p</i> < 0.01, g = 1.33), short- and long-term memory (<i>p</i> < 0.01, g = 1.72) and stress tolerance (<i>p</i> < 0.05, g = 1.06). The PSPEP had significant effect on improvement of the bilateral coordination (<i>p</i> < 0.01, g = 1.08). None of the two programs had effect on PIU.",
        "Engagement in PSPEP selectively contributed bilateral coordination and cognitive skills related to reaction to multiple stimuli. The FSPEP had multiple significant effects in improvement of cognitive outcomes."
