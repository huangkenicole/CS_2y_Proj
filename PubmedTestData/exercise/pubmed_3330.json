        "The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework can be used for evaluation of implementation initiatives in sports injury prevention. The aim was to evaluate the implementation of the injury prevention exercise programme <i>Knee Control+</i> among amateur clubs and coaches in one regional football district using all five dimensions of the RE-AIM framework.",
        "Dissemination of <i>Knee Control+</i> during\u2009the 2021 season with information and webinars within one regional football district. This was followed by a cross-sectional study with questionnaires to club personnel and coaches after the season.",
        "The reach of <i>Knee Control+</i> was\u2009fair to high, 83% of club personnel and 66% of coaches knew about the programme. 41% of club personnel and 51% of coaches had adopted it. Perceived programme effectiveness was high (6 on a 1-7 Likert scale) among coaches. Regarding implementation and maintenance, 27% of club personnel had informed coaches about <i>Knee Control+</i> and 57% planned to inform coaches. The coaches had implemented the programme mainly as recommended, but half used the programme once per week or less. Intention to maintain use of the programme was high (7 on a 1-7 Likert scale) among coaches.",
        "The reach of <i>Knee Control+</i> was\u2009fair to high, and adoption was fair in clubs, but there was a lack of policies for preventive training. Active strategies probably need to accompany dissemination of programme material. Reach, perceived effectiveness, adoption, implementation and planned maintenance were positive among coaches, but further studies are needed to analyse long-term maintenance."
