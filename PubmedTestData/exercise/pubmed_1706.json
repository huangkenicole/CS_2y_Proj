        "To discuss the effects of elastic band exercise on the frailty states in pre-frail elderly people.",
        "This study was a randomized controlled trial. Trial registration number is ChiCTR-IOC-17012579. Seventy pre-frail elderly people were randomly divided into elastic band group (<i>n</i> =\u00a035) and control group (<i>n</i> =\u00a035). Elastic band exercise was applied to elastic band group, 45-60\u00a0min per time for 8\u00a0weeks by 3\u00a0days a week; no exercise was applied to the control group. The frailty states, grip strength (female/male), walking speed, and physical activity were measured by the Fried frailty phenotype at pre-intervention, 4, and 8\u00a0weeks after intervention to assess the effects of exercise.",
        "The elastic band group showed significant improvements in the frailty states, grip strength (female) and walking speed both after 4-week and 8-week intervention (<i>P</i><\u00a00.001), and significant improvements in grip strength (male) and physical activity after 8-week intervention (<i>P</i><\u00a00.05). Within-group analysis (pre-intervention vs. after 4-week, after 4-week vs after 8-week, pre-intervention vs after 8-week) showed significant improvements (<i>P</i><\u00a00.001) in grip strength (female/male) and walking speed in the elastic band group over time, while no significant differences in the control group (<i>P >\u00a0</i>0.05).",
        "Elastic band exercise can improve frailty states in pre-frail elderly people, make them broke away from pre-frailty and restore them to non-frailty through improving the grip strength, walking speed and physical activity, and the effects after 8\u00a0weeks are better than those after 4\u00a0weeks."
