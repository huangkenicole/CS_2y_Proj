      "AbstractText": [
        "Musculoskeletal diseases affect 1.71 billion people worldwide, impose a high biopsychosocial burden on patients, and are associated with high economic costs. The use of digital health interventions is a promising cost-saving approach for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. As physical exercise is the best clinical practice in the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, digital health interventions that provide physical exercises could have a highly positive impact on musculoskeletal diseases, but evidence is lacking.",
        "This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of digital physical health exercises on patients with musculoskeletal diseases concerning the localization of the musculoskeletal disease, patient-reported outcomes, and medical treatment types.",
        "We performed systematic literature research using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was conducted using the PubMed, BISp, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist was used to assess the quality of the included original studies. To determine the evidence and direction of the impact of digital physical health exercises, a best-evidence synthesis was conducted, whereby only studies with at least acceptable methodological quality were included for validity purposes.",
        "A total of 8988 studies were screened, of which 30 (0.33%) randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 studies (53%) were of acceptable or high quality; they included 1840 patients (1008/1643, 61.35% female; 3 studies including 197 patients did not report gender distribution) with various musculoskeletal diseases. A total of 3 different intervention types (app-based interventions, internet-based exercises, and telerehabilitation) were used to deliver digital physical health exercises. Strong evidence was found for the positive impact of digital physical health exercises on musculoskeletal diseases located in the back. Moderate evidence was found for diseases located in the shoulder and hip, whereas evidence for the entire body was limited. Conflicting evidence was found for diseases located in the knee and hand. For patient-reported outcomes, strong evidence was found for impairment and quality of life. Conflicting evidence was found for pain and function. Regarding the medical treatment type, conflicting evidence was found for operative and conservative therapies.",
        "Strong to moderate evidence was found for a positive impact on musculoskeletal diseases located in the back, shoulder, and hip and on the patient-reported outcomes of impairment and quality of life. Thus, digital physical health exercises could have a positive effect on a variety of symptoms of musculoskeletal diseases."
