        "Patients under regular dialysis can also present alterations in the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic systems.",
        "The aim of this study is to compare the effects of strength and aerobic exercises performed during hemodialysis (HD) in individuals with chronic renal disease.",
        "Randomized clinical trial. It was developed as a program of exercises three times a week, in the first 2 h of HD for 8 weeks. The patients were divided into three groups: control (Group 1, n: 11), strength (Group 2, n: 11), and aerobic (Group 3, n: 10). G1 has not developed any type of physical training; G2 utilized a training load of 40% of one repetition maximum (1RM) with anklets, and developed three series of 15 repetitions. G3 pedaled seated in the dialysis seat, during 20 min, in an ergometric bicycle, with intensity regulated by the perceived effort scale. Before and after 8 weeks, the following variables were evaluated: respiratory muscular strength, pulmonary function, functional capacity, blood biochemistry, and quality of life.",
        "In the pre- and post-training comparison, there was statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), number of steps achieved (NSA), and quality of life (QoL) in the trained groups, as compared to the non-exercised group (G1).",
        "The strength and aerobic exercises developed during HD can improve the respiratory muscular strength, functional performance, and quality of life, when compared to individuals presenting the disease who have not developed any type of physical training."
