        "The aim of this paper was to highlight the special frequency of cases of rhabdomyolysis related to the practice of indoor cycling and to define the characteristics, course, and outcome of this disease.",
        "Retrospective review of clinical histories of patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis after indoor cycling in our unit from January 2012 to April 2013.",
        "Eleven patients were analyzed. All patients, regardless of the degree of previous physical training, were diagnosed after a first session of indoor cycling. Mean age was 27.63 years (SD=5.74). Fifty-four percent were women. Creatine kinase (CK) levels gradually decreased in response to rest and intensive intravenous hydration. Only in two cases was renal failure observed, and in none were electrolyte disorders, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or compartmental syndrome detected.",
        "A first session of indoor cycling has become a common cause of rhabdomyolysis secondary to the physical exercise in recent years, which should alert those responsible for teaching this sport of the need for a gradual start under adequate hydration and environmental conditions, because although the condition has a benign course with adequate treatment and the complication rate is low, there are patients with increased susceptibility to very high CK blood levels requiring hospitalization for treatment and follow-up of possible complications."
