        "Cardiac rehabilitation reduces the risk factors and improves the aerobic exercise capacity of patients after they have experienced cardiac events. This study compared the effects of two types of interval training in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). A single-blinded randomised controlled trial was conducted on 26 patients with MI which included 16 males and 10 females. After screening via non-probability convenience sampling, patients were randomised into two groups using toss and trial method. The control group was given aerobic interval training (AIT), consisting intervals of stationary cycling and walking on the treadmill. The experimental group received both AIT as well as resistance interval training comprising exercises of the upper and lower limbs. After 6 weeks, the outcomes of peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and 6-minute walk test distance (6MWT) were measured against the baseline. Non-parametric tests were applied for statistical analysis. In the group comparison, the experimental group showed significant improvement in peak VO2 and 6MWT (p=0.003 and 0.003 respectively), as well as in the quality of life measures. The combination of resistance interval training plus AIT proved more effective in improving cardiac outcomes and aerobic capacity."
