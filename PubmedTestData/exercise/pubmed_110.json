        "To investigate the effectiveness of home-based exercise training on exercise capacity, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).",
        "A systematic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Controlled Trials, Embase\u00ae, PubMed\u00ae, and Web of Science databases was performed for articles published through July 22, 2018.",
        "The meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager, version 5.3, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.",
        "10 articles with a total of 453 patients met the inclusion criteria. Home-based exercise training was found to increase the six-minute walk distance. In addition, anxiety was also improved after the intervention. However, no improvements in dyspnea, depression, or HRQOL were observed.",
        "Home-based exercise training as a nursing intervention for promoting the rehabilitation of patients with lung cancer can be recommended, but more research should be undertaken to determine the most effective exercises and follow-up methods."
