        "Six databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database, SinoMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to find the relevant randomised controlled trials published before January 2021. The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement. The included studies were assessed for quality using the Cochrane \"Risk of Bias\" assessment tool, and the data were analysed with review manager.",
        "Overall, fourteen studies were included. Compared physical exercise with normal daily life, the pooled effect size of all trials indicated that intervention had significant effect on fall prevention (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.85, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.73-0.98). The result of subgroup revealed that long-term exercise and balance exercise could reduce falling, while short-term exercise and more complex exercise couldn't.",
