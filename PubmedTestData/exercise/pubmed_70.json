        "Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) carries marked morbidity in runners. Its management is not standardized and lacks evidence base. We evaluated the effectiveness of three different exercises programs in reducing ITBS symptoms.",
        "Patients were divided into three equal treatment groups: ITB stretching (group A), conventional exercise (group B), and experimental hip strengthening exercise (group C). Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS; every week), lower extremity functional scale (LEFS; every 2 weeks), dynamometer (DN; weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), single-limb mini squat (SLMS; week 0, 8), and Y-balance test\u2122 (YBT), between and within group's differences were evaluated using ANOVA model.",
        "Twenty-four female runners (age 19-45 years) were included into one of three groups (A, B, and C). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) within group C was observed for composite YBT and DN for injured and non-injured leg, the YBT (injured leg for the posterior medial), LEFS, NPRS, and the SLMS. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was found between group A and group C. The stretching group exhibited statistically significant (p < 0.05) YBT anterior reach for the injured/non-injured leg and the LEFS.",
        "There were no statistical differences between the three groups. The subjects who underwent experimental hip strengthening exercises consistently showed improvements in outcome measures, and never scored less than the other two groups.",
