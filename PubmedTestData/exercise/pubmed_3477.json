        "Isometric exercise training (IET) reduces resting blood pressure (BP). Most previous protocols impose exercise barriers which undermine its effectiveness as a potential physical therapy for altering BP. An inexpensive, home-based programme would promote IET as a valuable tool in the fight against hypertension. The aims of this study were: (a) to investigate whether home-based wall squat training could successfully reduce resting BP and (b) to explore the physiological variables that might mediate a change in resting BP.",
        "Twenty-eight healthy normotensive males were randomly assigned to a control and a 4\u00a0week home-based IET intervention using a crossover design with a 4\u00a0week 'washout' period in-between. Wall squat training was completed 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0weekly over 4\u00a0weeks with 48\u00a0h between sessions. Each session comprised 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0min bouts of wall squat exercise performed at a participant-specific knee joint angle relative to a target HR of 95% HR<sub>peak</sub>, with 2\u00a0min rest between bouts. Resting heart rate, BP, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and stroke volume were taken at baseline and post each condition.",
        "Resting BP (systolic -4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05, diastolic -3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 and mean arterial -3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mmHg), cardiac output (-0.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0L\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) and heart rate (-5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0beats\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) were all reduced following IET, with no change in total peripheral resistance or stroke volume compared to the control.",
        "These findings suggest that the wall squat provides an effective method for reducing resting BP in the home resulting primarily from a reduction in resting heart rate."
