        "This study compared the effect of local and general fatiguing exercise on disturbed and static postural control performances. Surface electromyography and center of pressure signals were respectively recorded during self-initiated perturbation test and static postural stability test from 7 young male subjects. Local fatiguing exercise was performed using intermittent isometric knee extensions at the level of 40% of maximal voluntary torques. General fatiguing exercise was implemented with rowing ergometer at a speed of 200\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0m/min. Results of disturbed postural tests showed no significant change of anticipatory postural adjustment (APAs) organizations in individual muscles following both fatiguing exercises, but observed larger APAs coactivations in trunk and dorsal muscle pairs following local than general fatiguing exercise, and larger compensatory postural adjustments (CPAs) coactivation in dorsal muscle pair after both fatiguing exercises. In addition, the results of static postural tests indicated efficient static postural stability accompanying the down-weighting of visual input and the up-weighting of vestibular/somatosensory component following both fatiguing exercises. These findings evidenced a general compensation in the central nervous system in response to the neuromuscular deficiencies induced by local fatiguing exercise and put forward the function of sensory recalibration in maintaining postural stability under fatigue conditions."
