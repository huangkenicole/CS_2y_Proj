        "This editorial focuses on strength training, an integral part of the exercise prescription for children, adolescents and adults. While filling the complete exercise prescription of aerobic and strength components provides maximal health benefits, it is noteworthy that even performing only aerobic activities or strength training is still better than no activity. The exercise prescription should be individually tailored to every person, according to her/his preferences, physical or technical limitations, medical conditions, etc. Some prefer, or are limited to, strength training only. Such activities improve muscle strength and athletic capabilities, in children mostly via improved neuromuscular control, and in youth and adults through muscle hypertrophy as well. From a health perspective, strength training had only been associated with better cardiovascular risk profiles in youth and with reduced mortality risks in adults. Interventional studies demonstrated that such training improves cardiovascular risk and physical functioning in youth and in adults, in healthy individuals and in those with chronic health conditions. Undoubtedly, strength training is medicine."
