      "AbstractText": [
        "Effects of a multicomponent exercise programme have an impact on the physical, cognitive, and psychological domains in elderly community-dwellers. However, some individuals aged 65\u2009years or more have not shown positive effects after the intervention as reported in similar research. The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to clarify the effectiveness of a multicomponent programme based on reality orientation therapy (ROT) on the physical performance, cognitive ability, and psychological state in the elderly.",
        "Participants were recruited from the general public in 20 areas of Akita Prefecture, Japan, and they took part in each exercise programme for 90 min a day, once every 2\u2009weeks, for 3\u2009months, according to the group classification using cluster randomization into 20 cohorts in Akita. Physical, cognitive, and geriatric depression assessments were performed at baseline and after the 3-month intervention in both the ROT-based intervention group and the control group.",
        "The final samples for analysis consisted of 31 participants in the control group and 30 participants in the intervention group. The results of the statistical analysis comparing the two groups showed that the 5-repetition sit-to-stand test was performed significantly faster (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and that the results of the word list memory (WM) test and the Symbol Digit Substitution Task also had significantly improved (P\u2009<\u20090.05) after the intervention in both groups. The WM score did not show an interactive effect between the group and time factors, but it had a significant main effect on time in both groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "The results of our quasi-experimental study indicated that the multicomponent programme based on the ROT would be as effective as the original multicomponent programme combined with aerobic exercise and cognitive tasks, as highlighted in the WM."
