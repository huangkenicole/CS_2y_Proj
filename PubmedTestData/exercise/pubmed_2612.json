        "In adult transplant (Tx) populations, exercise rehabilitation strategies may improve sarcopenia components (muscle mass [MM], strength [MS], and physical performance [PP]). Limited data are available regarding exercise rehabilitation therapy in pediatric Tx populations.",
        "The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the feasibility and impact of exercise programs (EP) that include resistance exercise (RE) on markers of sarcopenia in pediatric Tx populations. Literature searches in SCOPUS and WEB OF SCIENCE were conducted to identify studies applying EP with a RE component in pediatric populations in the Tx setting.",
        "Twelve articles (2008-2022) met inclusion criteria. The exercise interventions varied in length (3\u2009weeks-12\u2009months), intensity (low to moderate), time pre/post Tx (0\u2009days-5\u2009years post Tx), age of participants (3-18\u2009years), adherence (63%-94%), and methodologies to measure components of sarcopenia. No studies measured all three components of sarcopenia concurrently. Approximately, 60% of studies found positive effects on MS and PP. Only one pediatric study measured body composition, therefore, the effect of exercise programs with RE components on MM is unknown.",
        "Exercise programs may be a beneficial treatment for sarcopenia in Tx populations, particularly in components of MS and PP. Studies measuring all three aspects of sarcopenia together in response to RE training in pediatrics remains an important gap. Studies that include body composition measurements in response to exercise are needed. Special considerations for the development of RE programs in pediatrics Tx populations are safety, supervision, engagement through family/peer involvement and incorporation of game/play-based elements."
