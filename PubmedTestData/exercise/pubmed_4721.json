        "The aim of this study was to develop an efficient, low-cost, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program and to evaluate the impact of the program on exercise as measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and treadmill endurance test.",
        "Twenty-nine subjects with COPD (FEV1 = 62.4 \u00b1 10.7% of predicted, 62.4 \u00b1 10.7 y old) were included in a randomized and prospective pulmonary rehabilitation program, and they performed 24 sessions, 5 d/week. The control group included 15 subjects (FEV1 = 54 \u00b1 26.2% of predicted, 65.3 \u00b1 8 y old). They were evaluated pre-intervention and post-intervention by the 6MWT, St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), treadmill endurance test, and spirometry. The home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program consisted of walking for 40 min along a corridor or a street, climbing stairs for 15 min, and exercising the arms with an oil can (1 kg) using diagonal movements for 15 min. Subjects were called once each week for encouragement and verification of adherence. Both groups received the usual pharmacologic treatment; in addition, the control group received a telephone call without guidance on exercise.",
        "The 2 groups were similar regarding age, FEV1, and FVC. The home-based pulmonary rehabilitation group increased by 65 m in the 6MWT (P < .05) and 316.6 \u00b1 81.8 m in the endurance test (P < .05) and decreased by > 4 units in all SGRQ domains. The control group showed no difference in any variable.",
        "This study demonstrates that a simple, low-cost, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program adapted to real-life situations leads to improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life."
