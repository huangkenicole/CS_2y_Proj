        "The main and common treatment of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, is hemodialysis (HD). Many reports have shown that exercise therapy is good for HD patients. This review aims to describe recent advances in exercise therapy in HD patients.",
        "Our key opinions have focused on varied types of exercise therapy and identified barriers to exercise therapy among HD patients. Exercise implementation includes aerobic exercise training, resistance exercise training, combined exercise training, and novel exercise interventions. Barriers include internal and external distress, such as HD patients' restrictions and environmental problems.",
        "This review is based on the novel/ most findings in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE from the inception of every database until August 2022.",
        "The systematic search strategy identified 6 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Four were specific to exercise therapy in HD, and three were to exercise barriers in HD. Massive evidence has demonstrated exercise therapy for HD has specific benefits and neglectful causes of exercise barriers.",
        "In this review, we aimed to summarize recent advances in individual exercise therapy recommendations (type, intensity, time, and frequency) and exercise barriers in HD patients. In conclusion, Low/moderate-intensity exercise trained for at least thirty minutes five times per week, including aerobic exercise (Walking, Jogging, Swimming, and Health Exercises), resistance training (Dumbbells, Band training, and Knee extension), and combination exercise (both) during the first 2 hours of dialysis treatment or non-dialysis days is advisable treatment recommendation."
