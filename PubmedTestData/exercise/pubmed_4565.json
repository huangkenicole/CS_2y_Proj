        "To examine the effect of high-velocity resistance training (HVRT) on the executive function of middle-aged and older adults with and without mobility limitations.",
        "Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a041, female: 48.9%) completed a supervised 12-week HVRT intervention (2 sessions/week; at 40-60% of one-repetition maximum). The sample included 17 middle-aged adults (40-55 years); 16 older adults (>60 years) and 8 mobility-limited older adults (LIM). Executive function was assessed before and after the intervention period and was reported as z-scores. Maximal dynamic strength, peak power, quadriceps muscle thickness, maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVIC), and functional performance were also measured pre and post intervention. Training-related adaptations in cognitive measures were calculated using a Generalized Estimating Equation model.",
        "HVRT improved executive function in LIM (adjusted marginal mean differences [AMMD]: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.38; p\u00a0=\u00a00.040) although no effect on middle-aged (AMMD: 0.04; 95%CI: -0.09; 0.17; p\u00a0=\u00a00.533) and older (AMMD: -0.11; 95%CI: -0.25; 0.02; p\u00a0=\u00a00.107) participants was observed. Improvements in maximal dynamic strength, peak power, MVIC, quadriceps muscle thickness, and functional performance were all associated with changes in executive function, and changes in the first four also seem to mediate the association between changes in functional performance and executive function.",
        "HVRT-induced improvement in executive function of mobility-limited older adults were mediated by changes in lower-body muscle strength, power, and muscle thickness. Our findings reinforce the relevance of muscle-strengthening exercises to preserve cognition and mobility in older adults."
