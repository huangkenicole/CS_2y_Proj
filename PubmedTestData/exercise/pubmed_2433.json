        "To review the outcome of 12 weeks of periodized, high-intensity interval training (HIT) in a man with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "A 42-year-old man (180\u2005cm tall, 68.4\u2005kg and 32.0% Fat) with a C8/T1 motor complete SCI took part in 12 weeks of 3 days per week arm crank ergometry (ACE) interval training. Training consisted of a combination of HIT that included three times 5\u2005\u2005min at \u223c70% Peak Power (W<sub>Peak</sub>) and 5\u2005\u2005min recovery (HIT<sub>5</sub>); four times 2.5\u2005\u2005min at \u223c85% W<sub>Peak</sub> and 5\u2005\u2005min recovery (HIT<sub>2.5</sub>); ten times 1\u2005\u2005min at \u223c110% W<sub>Peak</sub> and 2\u2005\u2005min recovery (HIT<sub>1</sub>). Heart rate (HR) zones were set as <75% HR<sub>Peak</sub> (Z1), 75-89% (Z2), and 90+% (Z3) and used to monitor overall training efficacy.",
        "Thirty-six sessions that included 8 HIT5, 10 HIT2.5, and 5 HIT1 sessions were completed. W<sub>Peak</sub> and VO<sub>2 Peak</sub> improved about 45% and 52%, respectively, by week 6, without further improvement at week 12, HR TRIMP scores and power in training sessions trended upward over the 12-week program.",
        "Twelve weeks of HIT resulted in a large increase in peak aerobic power, as well as submaximal endurance performance in our participant. The early plateau in maximal testing supports the use of submaximal training assessment important in the long-term training monitoring for SCI."
