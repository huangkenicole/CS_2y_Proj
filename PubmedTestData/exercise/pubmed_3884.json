      "AbstractText": [
        "Although low to moderate intensity exercise therapy is a predominant part of rehabilitation in nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP), effect sizes are small and optimal exercise modalities/intensities are unclear. Conversely, effects of high intensity training have not yet been investigated in this population.",
        "The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of high intensity training (HIT) and to explore the magnitude of the effects of a HIT program on exercise capacity and disease related outcome measures compared to conventional therapy for persons with NSCLBP.",
        "In this non-randomized controlled feasibility study, treatment satisfaction, adherence, disability, pain, physical activity, body composition, exercise capacity and self-reported motivation, were assessed in persons with NSCLBP, before (PRE) and after (POST) 6 weeks (12 sessions, 1.5 hours/session, 2 x/week) of high intensity cardiovascular (100% VO2Max) and high load resistance (80% 1RM) training (HIT, n= 10) and compared to average intensity/load (60% VO2max) conventional physical therapy (CON, n= 10).",
        "At PRE, CON and HIT did not differ, except for gender ratio and lean mass. Compared to CON, HIT retained motivation to rehabilitate better (HIT: +3%; CON: -25%) and had higher therapy adherence (+16%) during the study course. No adverse events were noted in both groups. Whereas disability reduced in both groups (HIT: -10.4%; CON: -8.3%), peak workload (+7.0%), time to exhaustion (+9.5%), and activity level (+5.6%) only improved in HIT.",
        "High intensity exercise therapy appears to be a feasible rehabilitation approach in NSCLBP. Outcomes improved following the HIT protocol, warranting the investigation of its effectiveness in future large scale RCT studies."
