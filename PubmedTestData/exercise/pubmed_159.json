        "Conservative treatment of lateral idiopathic curvatures of the spine is a difficult and complex therapeutic process that is not always successful. Repeated assessments of the patient&apos;s mastery of a given exercise may significantly increase the effectiveness of conservative treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the credibility of an original scale for evaluating DoboMed exercise proficiency in a group of people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.",
        "The study was conducted in a group of 41 patients with juvenile idiopathic scoliosis aged 10 to 16 years. In each patient, during a 3-week exercise period, the mastery of the Dobomed exercise method was assessed according to the authors original scale. Four physical therapists conducted this study.",
        "The Kendall-Smith concordance coefficient was used in the statistical analysis. On the basis of Kendalls W coefficient, Spearmans R coefficient of similarity was calculated to describe the correlation of all possible pairs of orderings. There was a high level of agreement between the therapists in the assessment of the key elements for mastering the method.",
        "1. The original method mastery evaluation scale has clinical value in monitoring the progress of exercises according to the Dobomed method. 2. A high level of agreement between the therapists was noted for those features that are important in mastering the method. 3. Standardisation of our scale for evaluating mastery of DoboMed exercises will allow patients to be monitored with regard to their performance of the exercises also by their parents."
