        "Objectives Stretching is an intervention often used in various kinds of rehabilitation protocols and the effects on pain sensitivity has sparsely been investigated, especially when addressing potential effects on pain. The objective is to investigate the immediate effects of an axial and peripheral prolonged stretch on pressure pain sensitivity (PPT) and temporal summation (TS) on local and distal sites in healthy subjects. Methods Twenty-two healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in this pilot study. Two prolonged stretching protocols were performed: low back and wrist extensors stretches. PPT and pinprick TS were measured pre- and post-intervention at local and remote sites. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the effects and significance of the interventions. Results The low back stretch induced an increase in PPT for both local and remote sites, and the wrist stretch produced a PPT increase only at the local site. TS did not change. Conclusions Low back stretching induced an increase in PPT at both local and remote sites whereas the wrist stretch only increased PPT locally, suggesting hypoalgesia at these sites. Further studies are needed to confirm the effect and mechanisms using randomised, controlled and parallel study design. Considering that pain sensitivity is different than clinical pain, results are difficult to extrapolate to clinical practice. Future studies testing clinical pain are needed to better understand the clinical implication of these results."
