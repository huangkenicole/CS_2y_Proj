        "Low back pain (LBP) is the second most frequent neuromuscular ailment among Americans and third reason for physician visits by older people. Although remedies have been reported to palliate LBP, there is no effective prevention. We performed this one-year pilot study to determine if daily intervention of mild home exercises, focused on conditioning muscles maintaining upright 2-legged balance, prevented LBP.",
        "University of Louisville hospital and research lab volunteer employees with no history of chronic back pain were randomized after informed consent. Subjects were divided into 2 statistically similar groups, control and intervention. LBP episodes were recorded and compared over the 1-year period. Medical, blood chemistry, spirometric and clinical examinations were done on all volunteers twice, at beginning and end of the trial period. A set of 6 calisthenics, focusing on balance-control, low-back-connected musculature, was taught to the intervention group over 2 months. A matched control group was observed and examined only. Exercises, performed daily, required 15 minutes.",
        "In this pilot study, LBP was completely prevented in intervention group (0 of 13), whereas nearly 60% of controls (10 of 17) experienced back pain in 1 year. Intervention group showed significant improvement in strengths of balance-controlling muscles; control group showed no change. Exercises yielded an unexpected fitness benefit of raising automatic respiratory exchange.",
        "This pilot study suggests that LBP can be prevented in 50-year-old healthy working persons by daily, mild home calisthenics that improve balance-muscle strength. We hypothesize that improved respiratory function may be related to improved posture."
