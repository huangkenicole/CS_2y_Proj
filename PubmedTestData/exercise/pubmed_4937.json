      "AbstractText": [
        "The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of two different high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs (low-volume vs high-volume) on chronotropic responses during exercise and recovery, and to contrast the results of the HIIT groups together to only physical activity recommendations in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients taking \u03b2-blockers.",
        "Resting heart rate (HRrest), peak HR (HRpeak), HR reserve (HRreserve = HRpeak-HRrest), HR recovery (HRR) as the difference between HRpeak and post-exercise HR, and chronotropic incompetence were assessed in 70 patients (58 \u00b1 8 yr) following MI with a cardiopulmonary exercise test to peak exertion before and after a 16-wk exercise intervention period. All participants were randomized to either attention control (AC) (physical activity recommendations) or one of the two supervised HIIT groups (2 d/wk).",
        "After the intervention, no significant between-HIIT group differences were observed. The HRpeak increased (P < .05) in low- (\u0394= 8 \u00b1 18%) and high-volume HIIT (\u0394= 6 \u00b1 9%), with a small decrease in AC (\u0394=- 2 \u00b1 12%, P > .05) resulting in large differences (P < .05) between HIIT and AC. The HRreserve increased (P < .05) in high-volume HIIT. The HRR slightly increased (P < .05) in low-volume (5th min, \u0394= 19 \u00b1 31%) and high-volume HIIT (2nd min, \u0394= 15 \u00b1 29%, and 5th min, \u0394= 19 \u00b1 28%).",
        "These findings suggest that both low- and high-volume HIIT elicit similar improvements in chronotropic responses after MI, independent of \u03b2-blocker treatment. Supervised HIIT was more effective than giving physical activity recommendations alone. Low-volume HIIT is presented as a potent and time-efficient exercise strategy that could enhance the sympathovagal balance in this population."
