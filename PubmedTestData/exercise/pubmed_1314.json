        "This study aimed to assess the feasibility of delivering a brief physical activity (PA) intervention to community rehabilitation clients. Participants were randomized to receive one session of stage-of-change-based PA education and counseling in addition to written educational material, or education material alone. Outcomes were measured at baseline and 3\u00a0months; the primary outcome was feasibility, measured by the percentage of those who were eligible, consented, randomized, and followed-up. A total of 123 individuals were both eligible and interested in participating, 32% of those screened on admission to the program. Forty participants consented, and 35 were randomized, with mean age 72\u00a0years (SD = 12.2). At baseline, 66% had recently commenced or intended to begin regular PA in the next 6\u00a0months. A total of 30 participants were followed-up. It is feasible to deliver education and counseling designed to support the long-term adoption of regular PA to community rehabilitation clients. Further refinement of the protocol is warranted (ACTRN12617000519358)."
