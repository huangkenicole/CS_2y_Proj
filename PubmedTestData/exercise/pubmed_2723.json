        "To assess the influence of the different exercise intervention mode, aerobic exercise training(AET), resistance training(RT) and AET RT, on blood glucose of pre-diabetes.",
        "Literatures were identified from the PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, CNKI and Wanfang databases. Relevant journals or conference proceedings were also searched manually. The qualities of randomized con-trolled trials that conformed to inclusion criteria were evaluated. Meta-analysis of the obtained related data was completed utilizing RevMan 5.2 statistical software. Mean difference of index related in exercise intervention groups and control group were calculated across the studies.",
        "Eight original literatures enrolled in this study. Compared with control group, combined effect of different exercise interventions on fast-ing blood glucose showed no significant, consistent with different intervention subgroups analysis. RT group and AET + RT group showed a sig-nificantly reduced role on 2 h postprandial blood index (<i>P</i> < 0.05). AET group showed a significantly reduced role on insulin resistance in-dex.",
