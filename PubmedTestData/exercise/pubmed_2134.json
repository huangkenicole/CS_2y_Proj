        "To assess the effectiveness of short-term exercise for treating sarcopenia in hospitalized older patients aged 80 years and over.",

        "Sarcopenic patients aged 80 years or over.",
        "The participants were allocated to the intervention group (to receive a mixed exercise program with 10 sessions over two weeks) or the control group (usual care) based on the sequence of admission.",
        "The primary outcome was the improvement in activities of daily living (ADL) estimated by the change in Barthel Index (BI) score from the baseline to the end of the 2-week intervention. The secondary outcomes were the changes in gait speed, handgrip strength, the time \"UP and GO\" test (TUG) score, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score.",
        "We included 121 participants (intervention group: n = 62; control group: n = 59). All participants in the intervention group finished all 10 exercise sessions. After the 2-week intervention, patients in the mixed exercise group achieved a significant improvement in ADL compared with their counterparts in the control group (the adjusted mean difference of the change in BI score was 7.8 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0 to 11.8 points). The mixed exercise program significantly but slightly improved gait speed (adjusted group difference in mean change: 0.06 m/s, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11 m/s). However, the mixed exercise program did not significantly improve the handgrip strength, SPPB score, or TUG score compared with usual care.",
        "Very old inpatients with sarcopenia can benefit from a mixed exercise program (even as short as two weeks) by improving their ADL and gait speed. However, the long-term effects of exercise on important clinical outcomes need to be further evaluated."
