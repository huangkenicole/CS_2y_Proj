        "Pulmonary oxygen uptake (V\u02d9O2p) at exercise onset is severely delayed in heart transplant recipients (HTRs). The role of exercise training to improve V\u02d9O2p kinetics in HTRs has not been studied. We examined V\u02d9O2p kinetics before and after 12 weeks of aerobic and strength training (HTR-T; n = 19, mean \u00b1 SD age: 57 \u00b1 10 years) or usual care (HTR-UC; n = 16, mean age: 58 \u00b1 12 years). Phase II V\u02d9O2p kinetics, reflecting the rate of muscle metabolic adaptation, improved 37% after training compared with usual care (HTR-UC, 15 \u00b1 19 vs 2 \u00b1 13 seconds improvement, p = 0.02). The change in rest to steady-state heart rate reserve before and after 12 weeks was not different in HTR-T (-2 \u00b1 9 beats/min) and HTR-UC (-1 \u00b1 7 beats/min; p = 0.78). No significant relation was found between the change in V\u02d9O2p kinetics and rest to steady-state heart rate reserve. Changes in leg lean tissue mass and V\u02d9O2p kinetics were significantly related (r = -0.46, p = 0.008). In conclusion, a favorable adaptation in skeletal muscle oxidative function may underpin our finding of faster V\u02d9O2p kinetics in HTRs after exercise training."
