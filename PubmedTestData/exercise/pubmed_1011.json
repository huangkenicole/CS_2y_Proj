      "AbstractText": [
        "Individuals with wrist osteoarthritis (OA) can suffer from pain, muscular weakness, and impaired motion of the wrist, which can reduce the quality of life. While there is strong evidence that all patients with OA should receive first-line treatment with education and exercises, this approach has not yet been proposed for individuals with wrist OA. Therefore, this trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a first line neuromuscular joint-protective exercise therapy program compared to a training program with range of motion (ROM) exercises in patients with wrist OA.",
        "In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), 48 patients with symptomatic and radiographically confirmed wrist OA were randomly allocated to a 12-week self-management program with either a neuromuscular joint-protective exercise therapy program (intervention group) or a training program with ROM exercises only (control group). Our primary outcome measure was the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) with secondary outcome measures of grip strength, range of wrist motion, the Numerical Pain Rating, Scale (NPRS), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). The outcome measures were evaluated by a blinded assessor at baseline and 12 weeks. Between-groups differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and within-group differences were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.",
        "A total of 41 participants were analyzed at 12 weeks. There were no significant differences in PRWE between the groups at 12\u00a0weeks (p\u2009=\u20090.27). However, DASH improved significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and NPRS on load within the intervention group (p\u2009=\u20090.006). The difference in DASH should be interpreted with caution since it could be due to a non-significant increase (worsening) from baseline in the control group in combination with a non-significant decrease (improvement) in the intervention group.",
        "This RCT showed that the novel neuromuscular joint-protective exercise therapy program was not superior in reducing pain and improving function compared to a training program with ROM exercises at 12\u00a0weeks. Future research is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of forthcoming exercise therapy treatment programs for patients with wrist OA.",
