        "Aqua-cycling is easy to learn, acceptable, and safe for patients with knee osteoarthritis. It can therefore be an ideal component of aquatic circuit training.",

        "A feasibility study using quantitative (pre-post) and qualitative (cross-sectional) assessments.",
        "A volunteer cohort of 10 women and men, age range 46-77 years, with knee osteoarthritis.",
        "Focus group interviews explored participants' experience with the training. Pre- and post-exercise knee pain, attendance, progression in training, and adverse events were registered.",
        "Seventy percent of patients attended all sessions. Focus groups revealed high levels of satisfaction with the selection of exercises, and participants valued the immediate pain relief experienced. Participants progressed well. However, aqua-cycling in an out-of-the-saddle position was too demanding for most participants.",
        "An aquatic circuit training that includes aqua- cycling is feasible for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Participants reported pain reduction and were positive about the diverse exercise programme. Aqua-cycling in a seated position is a safe and controlled type of movement."
