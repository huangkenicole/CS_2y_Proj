        "A water-based physical exercise program is extremely important for the rehabilitation of type 2 diabetes. Little is known about its action on cerebral electrical activity.",
        "To evaluate the effect of a water-based physical exercise protocol on electroencephalographic activity, blood glucose levels, and functional capacity, as well as their correlation, in type 2 diabetics.",
        "Study design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Forty volunteers were randomized into two groups: control (n = 20) and study (n = 20). A water-based physical exercise program comprising 50 min sessions was conducted three times a week for five weeks. Assessments were performed at the pre- and post-intervention and follow-up phases. The qualitative data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and Chi-Square. Quantitative data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis, Independent <i>t</i>, and ANOVA mixed tests. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to correlate the data.",
        "The data were similar when comparing the groups. Six-minute walk test data increased in the comparison between times (<i>p</i> = 0.01-PrexPos). EEG data decreased in comparison between times (prexfollow-up-<i>p</i> < 0.05), except AF3. EEG data decreased in the timexgroup comparison (prexfollow-up and postxfollow-up-<i>p</i> < 0.05).",
        "The water-based exercise protocol maintained electroencephalographic activity, glucose levels, and functional capacity in people with type 2 diabetes, and there was no relationship between brain electrical activity and capillary blood glucose."
