        "To evaluate the efficacy of functional balance exercises on balance impairment, physical activity and quality of life (QOL) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).",
        "A multiple-baseline time-series design with an uncontrolled intervention.",
        "Ten subjects with MS completed assessments twice before and once after a 10-week balance intervention. ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale.",
        "The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased. ABC scores, strength measures and activity measures were not significantly changed.",
        "Ten weeks of functional balance exercises provided a feasible intervention for individuals with MS that improved components of balance, mental well-being and perceived fatigue impact and ambulation disability. A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings. Implications for Rehabilitation A balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS. Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS. Functional balance exercises can positively impact clinical and objective measures of balance control and favorably influence perceptions of ambulation disability and fatigue as well as perceived quality of life in people with MS."
