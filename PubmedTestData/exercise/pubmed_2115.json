        "Two hundred female athletes (mean age 21.9\u00a0\u00b1\u20092.4\u2009years) were assigned randomly to a plyometrics exercise group (n\u00a0=\u00a050), a balance exercise group (n\u00a0=\u00a050), a combination of both exercises group (n\u00a0=\u00a050), or a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a050). One hundred seventy-nine female college athletes completed the study.",

        "Limits of stability, which was assessed using the Biodex Stability System to evaluate the performance of the dynamic balance. It was measured pre- and post-intervention after 6\u2009weeks.",
        "There were no differences in baseline data between groups (p\u00a0=\u2009.557). All groups showed significant improvement in limits of stability (p\u00a0<\u2009.001). The most marked improvement in the limits of stability was shown in the combination group compared to the control group (MD\u00a0=\u20094.1%, 95% CI [2.8, 5.3], p\u00a0<\u2009.001).",
