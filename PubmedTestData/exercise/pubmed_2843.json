        "This article presents the current state of research about both the physical activity of young people in Germany and its potential effects on health and health behaviour. The extent to which adolescents are physically active in their leisure time and in sports clubs has been on an unchangingly high level for approximately 25 years. More than 80% of them are physically active at least once a week and almost every second adolescent is a member in a sports club. The findings available do not corroborate the popular belief that the lack of physical activity is increasing. All in all, the state of national and international research about the interrelationship between sport and health in youth age is highly insufficient and inconsistent. Cross-sectional studies show -- with overall weak correlations -- that physically active young people stand out from non-active young people in most parameters, e.g. physical and psychosocial health resources, risk factors, complaints, subjective health status, tobacco consumption. The comparisons of health relevant behaviour, e.g. accidents, eating disorders and alcohol consumption, work to the disadvantage of physically active people. So far, the few existing longitudinal studies do not verify systematic effects on physical and psychosocial health resources, subjective health and health behaviour. However, some international studies show slight effects on the risk-factor profile; these effects may well last up to adult age. While the comparison of physically active and non-active subjects shows only weak correlations, somewhat distinct effects are displayed if physical activity is defined in a more differentiated way (frequency, duration, competition orientation, kinds of sport)."
