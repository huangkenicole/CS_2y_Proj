        "To study the effectiveness of performing Zumba exercise on the severity and duration of pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.",
        "Randomized controlled trial.",
        "Cairo University gynecology Hospital and Bahgat gym and fitness center.",
        "Ninety-eight women diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea.",
        "Study participants were divided randomly into 2 equal groups: group I included women who engaged in Zumba exercise for 60\u00a0minutes twice weekly for 8\u00a0weeks, and group II was a control group with no intervention.",
        "The primary outcome was the menstrual pain intensity measured using the visual analogue scale scores at 4 and 8\u00a0weeks after starting Zumba exercise. The secondary outcome was the difference in the duration of pain in both groups.",
        "Both groups were homogeneous regarding the baseline demographic characteristics. The severity of primary dysmenorrhea at the beginning of the study was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Menstrual pain intensity was significantly decreased in the Zumba group after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks of Zumba compared with the control group (mean difference, -2.94 [95% confidence interval, -3.39 to -2.48] and -3.79 [95% confidence interval, -4.16 to -3.43], respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Also, the duration of pain was shorter in the Zumba group compared with the control group at 8\u00a0weeks (4.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.90 vs 9.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.92\u00a0hours, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001).",
