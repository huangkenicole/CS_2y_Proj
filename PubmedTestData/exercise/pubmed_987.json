      "AbstractText": [
        "Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is one of the most common global joint disorders, especially in aging population, and is among leading health-related concerns of societies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was done to investigate the results related to the effects of exercise interventions on knee repositioning sense in patients with knee OA.",
        "An extensive search was independently performed in electronic databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted on knee OA and to evaluate knee repositioning sense before and after different exercise interventions. After extracting relevant data from eligible studies, results of the studies were pooled using a random-effects model of meta-analysis. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) of clinical trials was used for quality assessment of eligible studies.",
        "Among 2702 studies identified in the initial search, 17 studies were eligible for final systematic review and meta-analysis. The results showed that the patients who participated in different exercise interventions had significantly less knee repositioning error (mean differences: -1.141 degrees (95%CI: -1.510, -0.772, P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared to those who did not undergo exercise interventions. The eligible studies exhibited publication bias (Intercept: -6.69, P\u2009=\u2009.002), and the data showed significant heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u200985.633%, Q\u2009=\u2009153.125, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Moreover, meta regression showed more prolonged exercise duration might have more effects on knee repositioning error (Coefficient=-0.860, 95% CI=-1.705, -0.016, Z=-2.00, P\u2009=\u2009.045).",
        "There is strong evidence that exercise interventions may effectively reduce knee repositioning error. Moreover, it seems that more prolonged exercise duration may be associated with the greater effect size."
