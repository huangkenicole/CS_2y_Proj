        "A training intervention study using functional electrical stimulation-rowing (FES-R) in a group of eight individuals with tetraplegia.",
        "To assess the feasibility of a structured progressive FES-R training programme in people with tetraplegia, and to explore the number and type of FES-training sessions required to enable continuous FES-R for 30\u2009min.",
        "A fully integrated sports centre, elite rowing training centre and university sport science department.",
        "Eight participants with chronic complete and incomplete tetraplegia (C4 to C7, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A, B and C) who had not previously used any form of FES-assisted exercise, participated in the study. Participants completed a progressive FES-assisted training programme building to three continuous 30-min FES-R sessions per week at 60-80% of their predetermined peak power output. Thereafter, rowing performance was monitored for 12 months.",
        "number and type of FES-training sessions required before achieving 30-min continuous FES-R, and FES-R average power output (POav) pre and post 12 months training. Participant feedback of perceived benefits was also documented.",
        "All participants were able to continuously FES-row for 30\u2009min after completing 13\u00b17 FES-R training sessions. Each individual POav during 30\u2009min FES-R increased over 12 months FES-training. FES-R was found safe and well tolerated in this group of individuals with tetraplegia.",
        "Individuals with tetraplegia are able to engage in a progressive programme of FES-R training. Future research examining FES-R training as an adjunctive therapy in people with tetraplegia is warranted."
