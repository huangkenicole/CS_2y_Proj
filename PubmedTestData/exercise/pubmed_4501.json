        "To investigate the differences in body composition and metabolic syndrome (MS) under a daily 12,000-step strategy with or without moderate-intensity walking exercise in college students with obesity.",
        "Thirty-two adults with obesity (mean (s.d.) age: 19.72 (0.80) years; height: 165.38 (3.99) cm; wt: 83.31 (4.66) kg; body mass index: 30.38 (0.83) kg m<sup>-\u20092</sup>) were recruited and randomly assigned to the walking step goal group (WSG; achieving 12,000 steps per day), walking exercise group (WEG; achieving 12,000 steps per day, including 3\u2009days per week on which walking at a step rate of over 103 steps min<sup>-\u20091</sup> was required), or control group (CG; maintaining a free-living life style). Each participant's accumulated daily steps from daily activities and walking exercises were monitored using a smartwatch for 8\u2009weeks. The variables of body composition and MS were measured before and after intervention.",
        "Average daily steps over 8\u2009weeks did not significantly differ between the WSG and WEG (11,677.67 (480.24) vs. 12,131.90 (527.14) steps per day, respectively, P\u2009>\u00a0.05). Although the CG and WSG showed no improvement in body composition, the WEG exhibited significant improvements in terms of hip circumference and visceral fat area (VFA) (\u2206 -\u20092.28 (3.27) cm and \u2206 -\u200913.11 (9.83) cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, P\u2009<\u2009.05); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting glucose (FG), and triglycerides (TG) (\u2206 16.36 (8.39), \u2206 -\u20092.53 (3.73), and \u2206 -\u200910.52 (36.26) mg dL<sup>-\u20091</sup>, respectively, P\u2009<\u2009.05). The WSG exhibited improvements only in HDL-C (\u2206 14.24 (16.13) mg dL<sup>-\u20091</sup>, P\u2009<\u2009.05).",
        "The combination of walking exercise program and daily step goal is a more time efficient strategy in improving body composition and MS than simply establishing a daily step goal. Furthermore, this strategy may also include a potential reduction effect on the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.",
