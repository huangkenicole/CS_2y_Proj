        "To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the inclusion of trigger point-dry needling (TrP-DN) into an exercise program for the management of subacromial pain syndrome.",
        "Fifty patients with unilateral subacromial pain syndrome were randomized with concealed allocation to exercise alone or exercise plus TrP-DN. Both groups were asked to perform an exercise program targeting the rotator cuff musculature twice daily for five weeks. Patients allocated to the exercise plus TrP-DN group also received dry needling during the second and fourth sessions. Societal costs and health-related quality of life (estimated by EuroQol-5D-5L) over a one-year follow-up were used to generate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ratios for each intervention.",
        "Intention-to-treat analysis was possible for 48 (96%) of the participants. Those in the exercise group made more visits to medical doctors and received a greater number of other treatments (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The major contributor to societal costs (77%) was the absenteeism paid labor in favor of the exercise plus TrP-DN group (P\u2009=\u20090.03). The combination of exercise plus TrP-DN was less costly (mean difference cost/patient = \u20ac517.34, P\u2009=\u20090.003) than exercise alone. Incremental QALYs showed greater benefit for exercise plus TrP-DN (difference = 2.87, 95% confidence interval = 2.85-2.89). Therefore, the inclusion of TrP-DN into an exercise program was more likely to be cost-effective than an exercise program alone, with 99.5% of the iterations falling in the dominant area.",
        "The inclusion of TrP-DN into an exercise program was more cost-effective for individuals with subacromial pain syndrome than exercise alone. From a cost-benefit perspective, the inclusion of TrP-DN into multimodal management of patients with subacromial pain syndrome should be considered."
