        "To determine the effectiveness of a person-centred intervention, including advice on physical activity, for improving pain intensity, physical activity, and other health-related outcomes in persons with chronic widespread pain , when delivered with digital eHealth support compared with standard telephone follow-up.",
        "Randomized controlled trial.",
        "Individuals with chronic widespread pain (n\u2009=\u2009139), aged 20-65 years, who had previously participated in a pain educational programme at primary healthcare units, were contacted during the period 2018-19 and randomized to an intervention group (n\u2009=\u200969) or an active control group (n\u2009=\u200970).",
        "Together with a physiotherapist, participants in both groups developed person-centred health plans for physical activity. The intervention group was supported via a digital platform for 6 months. The active control group received support via one follow-up phone call. Primary outcome was pain intensity. Secondary outcomes were physical activity and other health-related outcomes.",
        "No significant differences were found between the groups after 6 months, except for a significant decrease in global fatigue in the active control group compared with the intervention group.",
        "Future development of interventions supporting persons with chronic pain to maintain regular exercise is warranted."
