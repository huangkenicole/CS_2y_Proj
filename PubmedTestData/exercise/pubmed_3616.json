        "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as a silent epidemic, is currently a substantial public health problem worldwide. Given the increased energy demands following brain injury, relevant guidelines tend to recommend absolute physical and cognitive rest for patients post-TBI. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that strict rest does not provide additional benefits to patients' recovery. By contrast, as a cost-effective non-pharmacological therapy, exercise has shown promise for enhancing functional outcomes after injury. This article summarizes the most recent evidence supporting the beneficial effects of exercise on TBI outcomes, focusing on the efficacy of exercise for cognitive recovery after injury and its potential mechanisms. Available evidence demonstrates the potential of exercise in improving cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and post-concussion syndrome following TBI. However, the clinical application for exercise rehabilitation in TBI remains challenging, particularly due to the inadequacy of the existing clinical evaluation system. Also, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms whereby exercise promotes its most beneficial effects post-TBI will aid in the development of new clinical strategies to best benefit of these patients."
