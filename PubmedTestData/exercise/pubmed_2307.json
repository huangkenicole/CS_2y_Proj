        "The translation of knowledge from exercise training research into the clinical management of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson disease requires evidence-based guidelines that are uniformly recognizable by healthcare practitioners and patients/clients. This article synthesized resources that reported aerobic and resistance training guidelines for people with multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson disease. Systematic searches yielded 25 eligible resources from electronic databases and Web sites or textbooks of major organizations. Data were extracted (exercise frequency, intensity, time, and type) and synthesized into three sets of recommendations. Exercise guidelines for multiple sclerosis consistently recommended 2-3 d/wk of aerobic training (10-30 mins at moderate intensity) and 2-3 d/wk of resistance training (1-3 sets between 8 and 15 repetition maximum). Exercise guidelines for stroke recommended 3-5 d/wk of aerobic training (20-40 mins at moderate intensity) and 2-3 d/wk of resistance training (1-3 sets of 8-15 repetitions between 30% and 50% 1 repetition maximum). Exercise guidelines for Parkinson disease recommended 3-5 d/wk of aerobic training (20-60 mins at moderate intensity) and 2-3 d/wk of resistance training (1-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions between 40% and 50% of 1 repetition maximum). This harmonization of exercise guidelines provides a prescriptive basis for healthcare providers, exercise professionals, and people with multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Parkinson disease regarding exercise programming."
