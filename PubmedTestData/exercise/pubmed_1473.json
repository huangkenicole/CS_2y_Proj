        "Sustainable exercise strategies are needed for older adults to maintain aerobic capacity and strength. The objective of this pilot in 6 adults \u2265 65\u00a0years of age was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of high-intensity functional circuit training which does not require stationary equipment. Instructor-led small group exercise classes were held 3x/week for 12\u00a0weeks using weight-bearing exercises performed in a circuit format at ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) of 6-8/10. All 6 participants completed the pilot and showed significant improvements by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The six-minute walk distance increased 10.5%. Timed arm curl and chair stands increased 26.8% and 30.3% (all p \u2264\u00a00.03). These preliminary findings suggest that high-intensity functional circuit exercise is feasible in older adults and increases functional measures of aerobic capacity and strength. Further research is warranted to develop this strategy which has the potential for broad dissemination without the need for a traditional exercise facility."
