        "A prerequisite for interpreting electromyography (EMG) data is to normalize them to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), expressing them as percentage of the MVC.",
        "The objective of this study was to compare different recommended MVC exercises for the latissimus dorsi and identify the exercise that elicits the highest EMG amplitude.",
        "Fifteen male participants were recruited. Five recommended MVC exercises were investigated, including chest-supported shoulder extension, prone shoulder extension, lat-pull down, abducted shoulder flexion, and internal shoulder rotation.",
        "Chest-supported shoulder extension reported the highest mean EMG, which was not significantly different from the mean EMG of prone shoulder extension. Both of these exercises led to significantly greater EMG means than the other exercises. Sixty percent of the participants achieved their highest EMG amplitude with chest-supported shoulder extension and 40% with prone shoulder extension. None of the other exercises elicited the highest EMG amplitude in any of the participants.",
        "Both chest-supported shoulder extension and prone shoulder extension proved to be effective MVC exercises, with the former showing more consistency in eliciting the highest EMG amplitude. If the true MVC is desired, the authors recommend performing both exercises and then using the overall highest EMG amplitude for normalization purposes."
