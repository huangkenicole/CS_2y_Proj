        "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of global disability. According to current guidelines, exercise is the most recommended and important non-surgical treatment for knee OA. However, the best type of exercise for this condition remains unclear. Evidence has shown that traditional Chinese exercises may be more effective. Therefore, the current prospective, two-armed, single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to identify an effective physiotherapy for knee OA.",
        "In total, 114 patients with painful knee OA will be recruited from the orthopedic outpatient department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital. To compare the therapeutic effect of two different home-based exercise programs, the participants will be randomly assigned into the experimental group (leg swing exercise) or the control group (quadriceps strengthening exercise). Each participant in both groups will be required to attend five individual sessions with a physiotherapist who will teach the exercise program and monitor progress. Participants will be instructed to perform the exercises at home every day for 12\u2009weeks. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 12 and 24\u2009weeks after starting the intervention. The primary outcomes are average overall knee pain and physical function in daily life. The secondary outcomes include other measures of knee pain, physical function, patient-perceived satisfactory improvement, health-related quality of life, physical activity and performance, muscle strength of the lower limb, and adherence.",
        "This study will provide more evidence on the effects of traditional Chinese exercise on improving physical function and relieving joint pain among patients with knee OA. If proven effective, leg swing exercise can be used as a non-surgical treatment for knee OA in the future.",
