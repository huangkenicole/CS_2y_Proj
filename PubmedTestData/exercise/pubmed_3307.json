        "Panvascular diseases are a group of vascular system diseases, mainly including the heart, brain, neck, and other parts of the vascular lesions. As a non-pharmacological intervention, exercise therapy could prevent and treat Panvascular diseases. However, few bibliometric analyses of exercise therapy in Panvascular disease exist. This study aimed to analyze the trends and hotspots over the past decade and provide insights into the latest state of the art in global research, thereby contributing to further research in the field. We systematically searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) for articles on exercise therapy and Panvascular disease. The acquired information from the reports was analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to assess and forecast this field hottest areas and trends. The final analysis included 294 articles by our specified inclusion criteria. The number of publications has gradually increased over the past decade. Stroke was one of the most studied Panvascular diseases. China and the University of Sao Paulo were the country es and institutions that contributed the most to the field. Mary M. McDermott was the most prolific researcher, and the Journal of Vascular Surgery published the most articles. The 6-minute walk test, skeletal muscle, oxidative stress, and supervised exercise therapy were hot topics from 2019 to 2023. In conclusion, exploring exercise therapy programs and exercise mechanisms for Panvascular diseases has been ongoing. This study revealed the current status and trends of research in the field and identified hot topics. It was helpful for scholars to understand exercise therapy critical role in treating and preventing Panvascular diseases and provided a reference for clinical decision-making and further research."
