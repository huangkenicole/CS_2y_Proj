        "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Smoking is one of the main risk factors associated with this cancer. Treatment will depend on the form of cancer and its stage, existing many therapeutic possibilities. In this regard, therapeutic exercise plays an important role in lung cancer care, as well as the pulmonary rehabilitation and respiratory physical therapy.",
        "To review the current scientific literature about the effects of therapeutic exercise in lung cancer.",
        "A search was carried out in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus y Web of Science using de terms \"Exercise Therapy\" and \"Lung Neoplasms\". 141 studies were obtained, but only 19 were selected by adjusting to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 10 of them were randomized controlled trials with a Jadad score between 2 and 3.",
        "These works performed a large variety of interventions based on therapeutic exercise, classified in preoperative, postoperative, during treatment, post treatment and combination. Most focused on aerobic exercise, muscle strength and respiratory exercises.",
        "therapeutic exercise seems to be positive and obtain significant improvements in patients with lung cancer, regardless the moment of intervention and the type of exercise performed."
