        "Thoracic kyphotic posture is accompanying increased biomechanical load of the backbone which is possibly problematic.",
        "The current study aimed to examine the effects of general active exercise versus Theraband exercise on female kyphotic posture.",
        "An experimental study was conducted at the biomechanical lab. in Physical Therapy College, Cairo University. Fourteen female volunteers with kyphotic posture aged from 18 to 30 years were selected and equally distributed into two groups; 1st group received Theraband exercises (neck retraction exercise, scapular retraction exercise, and resistive shoulder blade squeeze) and 2nd group received general active exercises (Thoracic stretching exercise, thoracic extension exercises, and extension in lying with cervical retraction exercises). Each exercise was conducted properly for 60\u00a0min in 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks (total of 12 sessions per week). The Index of kyphosis (IK) was calculated before and after treatment. Moreover, the percentage of back disability index questionnaire (PBDI) and pain score were also detected.",
        "Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to compare the post-treatment's means between the first and second groups and control the pre-treatment variables. No significant differences were found post-treatment (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Moreover, IK measures showed a statistically significant difference post-treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The paired sample t-test showed statistically significant differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all variables within the first and second groups.",
        "The current study demonstrated the positive effect of both techniques in reducing the IK, percentage of back disability index, and pain score with a more positive effect of Theraband in reducing the IK measures post-treatment."
