        "Although physical exercise has been suggested to influence cognitive function, previous exercise studies show inconsistent results in people with dementia.",
        "To investigate effects of exercise on cognitive function in people with dementia.",
        "The Ume\u00e5 Dementia and Exercise (UMDEX) study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial, was set in 16 nursing homes in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. One hundred-and-forty-one women and 45 men with dementia; mean age of 85 y and mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 15, were randomized to a High-Intensity Functional Exercise program or a seated attention control activity. Blinded assessors measured global cognitive function using the MMSE and the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and executive function using Verbal fluency (VF) at baseline and 4 months (directly after intervention completion), and MMSE and VF at 7 months.",
        "Linear mixed models showed no between-group effects in mean difference from baseline (95% confidence intervals, CI) at 4 months in MMSE (-0.27; 95% CI -1.4 to 0.87, p\u200a=\u200a0.644), ADAS-Cog (-1.04, 95% CI -4 to 1.92, p\u200a=\u200a0.491), or VF (-0.53, 95% CI -1.42 to 0.35, p\u200a=\u200a0.241) or at 7 months in MMSE (-1.15, 95% CI -2.32 to 0.03, p\u200a=\u200a0.056) or VF (-0.18, 95% CI -1.09 to 0.74, p\u200a=\u200a0.707).",
