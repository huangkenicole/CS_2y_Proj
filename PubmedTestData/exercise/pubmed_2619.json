        "Functional exercises is very essential to the recovery of patients with fracture. We aimed to evaluate the compliance of functional exercises in school-age children with limb fracture, to provide evidence to the clinical management and nursing care of children with limb fracture.",
        "School-age children with limb fractures treated in our hospital from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 were selected. The characteristics and postoperative functional exercise compliance of included children were analyzed. Pearson correlation and Logistic regression analysis were conducted to analyze the influencing factors of compliance to functional exercises.",
        "A total of 328 children with limb fracture were included, the incidence of compliance to functional exercise was only 35.98%. Pearson correlation analysis showed that age(r\u2009=\u20090.707), only child of family(r\u2009=\u20090.537), guardians(r\u2009=\u20090.642) and type of temperament(r\u2009=\u20090.635) were correlated with compliance to functional exercises in school-age children with limb fractures (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that age\u2009\u2264\u200910y (OR2.913, 95%CI2.091\u2009~\u20093.611), only child of family (OR2.006, 95%CI1.683\u2009~\u20092.558), guarded by grandparents (OR1.512, 95%CI1.201\u2009~\u20092.118), non-easy-going temperament (OR4.127, 95%CI3.811\u2009~\u20094.902) were the influencing factors of non-compliance to functional exercises in children with limb fracture (all p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "School-age children have poor compliance with functional exercises after limb fractures, and there are many influencing factors. For children with those risks, health care providers should actively intervene in nursing to improve children's exercise compliance and the rehabilitation effect."
