        "Cancer and its treatment significantly impact the quality of life (QOL) of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. This meta-analysis examined the effects of exercise interventions on the generic and cancer-specific QOL of AYA cancer patients and survivors.",
        "Four databases were searched from January 2010 to September 2019. RevMan 5.3 was used to synthesize the effects of exercise intervention on the QOL of AYA cancer patients and survivors.",
        "A total of 11 eligible studies have been included in this paper. Direct outcome comparisons found that pooled overall effects on generic QOL were in favor of exercise interventions, but only with marginal significance (Z= 1.96, P = 0.05). When performing the subscale analysis of the generic QOL, three trials assessed the effects of exercise interventions on the emotional domain of QOL, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for the overall intervention effect was 3.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42 to 6.51). Additionally, exercise interventions increased the minutes of physical activity per week undertaken by AYA cancer patients and survivors (Z= 2.88, P = 0.004).",
        "Exercise interventions had positive effects on generic QOL and increased the minutes of physical activity per week undertaken by AYA cancer patients and survivors. In addition, exercise intervention programs appear to be safe, as there were no studies that reported adverse events. Future research, with rigorous methodological standards and larger sample sizes, should be designed to confirm the positive effects of exercise interventions on the QOL of AYA cancer patients and survivors."
