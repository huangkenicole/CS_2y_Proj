      "AbstractText": [
        "Most older adults do not engage in regular physical activity. However, more research on options to partake in regular exercise in this population by reducing barriers and enhancing enablers while still reaching benefits is needed.",
        "Using embedded mixed methods, 10 inactive older adults over the age of 65 completed a 3-week square-stepping exercise intervention to help overcome the initial barriers and activate initial enablers to perform regular exercise. Physical activity level was tracked at home with a pedometer using median steps/day over seven days for pre-post measure. Aerobic intensity while doing square-stepping exercises was quantified via a heart rate monitor in a supervised session. Each participant had an interview asking about barriers and enablers to regular exercise and if the intervention could modify any. Based on initial physical activity a framework matrix was used to pull potential barriers to compare, contrast, and search for patterns between participants with lower and higher initial physical activity levels.",
        "The 3-week square-stepping exercise intervention helped participants overcome barriers such as being uncomfortable in a fitness facility and body image and activate enablers such as the use of home equipment and convenience. The median total steps/day increased by 12% (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and a moderate-intensity level was reached by 80% of the sample participants when performing the square stepping exercise during a supervised session. Common barriers such as having a suitable program, hard to keep the intensity were reported by participants regardless of the initial physical activity level.",
        "Regardless of initial physical activity level, inactive older adults can increase physical activity level at the recommended intensity and overcome common barriers to exercise when performing square-stepping exercises, especially for those intimidated by a fitness facility setting and those concerned with their body image. A longer intervention including more participants using the square-stepping exercises is required to understand if square-stepping exercises can increase the proportion of older adults exercising regularly."
