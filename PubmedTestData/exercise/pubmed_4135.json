        "Aging often leads to cognitive function decline, sensory structure deterioration, and musculoskeletal system weakening. This impacts postural control during static and dynamic activities like walking, increasing the fall risk among the elderly. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) face an elevated fall risk and cognitive decline, magnifying the public health concern.",
        "This study aimed to explore solutions by investigating the effects of a multi-component physical activity program on cognitive and motor functions in MCI patients.",
        "Twenty-three participants were enrolled in the study and assigned into two groups: an intervention group (n\u200a=\u200a13; age\u200a=\u200a85.7\u00b15.5 years) and a control group (n\u200a=\u200a9; age\u200a=\u200a85\u00b16.7 years). The study spanned two months, with participants engaging in three 60-minute weekly physical exercise sessions. The intervention focused on improving proprioception, muscle strength, and balance.",
        "Results demonstrated significant enhancements in physical performance, fall risk reduction, and balance (p\u200a<\u200a0.05). Various tests, including the timed up and go test, Unipedal Stance test, Tinetti test, Short Physical Performance Battery, and 6-minute walking test, indicated these improvements. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination, revealing non-significant progress (p\u200a>\u200a0.05). Predictive models for outcomes were developed using linear regression analysis during the follow-up stage.",
        "This study underscores the effectiveness of a multi-component physical activity program encompassing balance, proprioception, and muscle-strengthening exercises as a non-pharmaceutical approach in improving balance skills and playing a key role in mitigating the risk of falls among old adults with MCI."
