        "This study aimed to investigate the effects of supervised and home-based exercise programs on older people with frailty or pre-frailty.",
        "A total of 146 community-dwelling participants aged 65 and older who were prefrail or frail were randomly allocated into supervised exercise (N\u200a=\u200a74) and home exercise (N\u200a=\u200a72) groups. The 3-month supervised exercise training consisted of 3 exercise sessions per week, was performed at a hospital and supervised by a physical therapist. Home exercise participants took instructions on exercise and illustrated exercise handouts. The baseline and 3-month follow-up measurements included body composition, strength of selected upper and lower limb muscle groups, grip and leg press strengths, and five physical performance tests. Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis was applied to determine whether two groups differ in terms of changes before and after the intervention and to compare within-group improvements.",
        "After 3 months of supervised or home-based exercise, the average number of frailty criteria met and fat percentage decreased significantly. Strength of knee extensors, knee flexors and leg press improved significantly in supervised exercise group. In home-based exercise group, the strength of all muscle groups tested improved significantly, except for leg press strength. Walking speed improved in both groups, and timed-up-and-go and timed chair rise tests improved significantly only in supervised exercise group.",
        "Three-month supervised or home-based exercise improved walking speed and strength of the limb muscles. Supervised group showed more improvements in the physical performance tests compared with home-based exercise group."
