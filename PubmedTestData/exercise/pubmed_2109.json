        "Anterior knee pain, with or without joint crepitus during squatting, is the common clinical feature in the individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Altered lower extremity alignment and lumbo-pelvic-thigh muscles motor control is often associated with PFPS. Although current interventions recommend individual muscle activation and strength training exercises, the reported benefits of cocontraction-based exercises in PFPS is limited. This might be due to the long-standing hypothesis that exercise-induced cocontraction of thigh muscles may induce a negative effect by increasing the joint contact forces in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. This case report demonstrates that neuromuscular re-education performed with lumbo-pelvic-thigh muscle cocontraction may improve functional performance and reduce patellofemoral joint crepitus in PFPS. Further controlled trials are necessary to generalize these results LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V."
