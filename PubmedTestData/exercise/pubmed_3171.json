        "Regular physical exercise is recommended for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, it is unclear whether the effects of exercise training on arterial stiffness are the same in older hypertensive individuals as those observed in older healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exercise training on arterial stiffness between older hypertensive and healthy females.",
        "Ninety-two females with untreated hypertension and 108 healthy females were randomly assigned to either the control group or to participate in a 12-week training program. In the training groups, the subjects engaged in 90 min of training twice a week for 12 weeks. Each training program included recreational activities, six to eight resistance exercises for circuit training and chair-based exercise for the lower extremities. The systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and brachial to ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were obtained in the supine position using an automatic pulse wave form analyzer.",
        "Compared with that observed in the control group, greater reductions in the baPWV and SBP/DBP were achieved in both training groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant difference in the delta baPWV values obtained before and after training was noted between the hypertensive (-72.5 \u00b1 8.1 cm s(-1)) and healthy females (-131.5 \u00b1 107.3 cm s(-1)) who participated in the training program (P < 0.05).",
        "These data indicate that exercise training produces fewer improvements in arterial stiffness in older hypertensive females than in older healthy females."
