        "Bone lesions and other disease- and treatment-related side effects commonly experienced by people with multiple myeloma (MM) may impede their ability to exercise. This systematic review evaluated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of exercise program participation on the physiological and/or psychological health of people with MM. Literature searches were conducted through five electronic databases and appraised using the Delphi list of criteria. Controlled trials that assessed the safety and feasibility of an exercise intervention and its effects on disease- or treatment-related symptoms in people with MM were included. Seven studies of varying quality involving 563 participants were included. All studies concluded that exercise was safe, reporting zero serious and 4 adverse events attributable to exercise testing or training. Attendance ranged from 58% to 96%, however no study reported adherence to the exercise prescription. Compared to a control group, exercise did not appear to affect fatigue, depression, anxiety, body composition, quality of life, or sleep. Isolated studies identified between-group differences favoring exercise in lower limb strength (+8.4 kg, 95% CI 0.5, 16.3, P= .04), peak oxygen uptake (+1.2 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 0.3, 3.7, P= .02), physical activity (+6.5MET-hs/wk, P< .001), stem cell collection attempts (1.1 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.9, P< .01), and red blood cell (1.8 \u00b1 2.2 vs. 2.4 \u00b1 2.6, P< .05) and platelet transfusions (2.3 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 3.5 \u00b1 3.4, P < .05) during transplantation. Exercise interventions appear safe and well attended by people with MM. The lack of improvements in disease- and treatment-related symptoms requires further exploration to determine whether exercise is a sufficient stimulus to elicit benefits in this unique population."
