        "Harrison, PW, Kelly, VG, Jenkins, DG, McGuigan, MR, Holmberg, PM, and James, LP. Does moderate-load priming activity influence maximal upper-body performance and perceptual state?. J Strength Cond Res 37(11): e581-e587, 2023-The results of previous research indicate that resistance exercise \"priming\" may improve strength-power measures within 48 hours after their completion. Although researchers have primarily examined performance responses after lower-body priming stimuli, investigations examining the effects of upper-body resistance priming exercises are presently limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine upper-body pushing and pulling performance in addition to perceptual responses 3 and 27 hours after moderate-load (ML) upper-body resistance priming exercise. Fourteen resistance-trained men were assigned to complete ML priming (4 \u00d7 3 bench press and bench pull at 65% 1RM [repetition maximum]) and control (rest) protocols in a randomized and counterbalanced order. Peak velocity during the bench throw and bench pull tests involving different loads (25, 50, and 75% 1RM) showed no practical change at 3 and 27 hours after the priming session (p = 0.216-0.99, Cliff's d = -0.041 to 0.225). Small effect size increases in perceptual measures (\"physical feeling,\" \"physical performance,\" \"aggression\" [p = 0.400-0.553, Cliff's d = 0.183-0.201], and \"muscular heaviness\" [p = 0.178, Cliff's d = 0.231]) were found at 3 hours postpriming. A moderate practical increase was observed in perceived \"physical feeling\" compared with control (p = 0.385, Cliff's d = 0.349) in addition to small effect size increases in perceived \"physical performance\" and \"aggression\" (Cliff's d = 0.243-0.290) at 27 hours after priming activities. These results indicate that upper-body strength-power changes within 27 hours after ML upper-body resistance exercise priming are not practically meaningful."
