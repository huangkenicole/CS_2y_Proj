        "Oral motor exercises, for recovering tongue strength, can be integrated with computer games to increase motivation, especially for treatments in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of tongue strength on motor performance in computer games reliant on lingual force generation. An observational study was carried out at a speech-language pathology outpatient university clinic. Twenty participants (10 with normal tongue strength and 10 with reduced tongue strength) aged 8-13\u00a0years used an intra-oral joystick controlled by the tongue to play six computer games during which they had to reach targets that appeared on the screen. Motor performance was measured by the number of attempts to score and the time during which the target force was maintained. Tongue motor performance was compared between groups and across directions of tongue movement, resistance force levels, order of target appearance, continuous force application time on the target, age and sex. Children with normal tongue strength had a lower number of attempts to score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.014) and maintained the target force for longer periods (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) than those with reduced tongue strength. The performance was better for both groups (a) in the downward direction compared with the performance in other directions, (b) in games with the lowest resistive force level (0.5\u00a0N) compared to those with other levels of resistive force and (c) in the second and third rounds compared with the first round. There were no gender-related differences in performance. Older participants performed better than younger participants. Tongue strength, direction of movement, force to reach the target, time of continuous force application, order of target appearance and age influenced tongue motor performance."
