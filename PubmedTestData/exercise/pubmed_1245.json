        "Quasi-Experimental.",
        "To assess the activation of semispinalis cervicis (d-SSC) and splenius capitis (s-SC) muscles, and the activation between the two during neck pulley and free weight exercises.",
        "Altered activation of cervical extensors may occur with neck pain, suggesting that exercises should be designed to target these muscles.",
        "d-SSC and s-SC activity was recorded unilaterally with intramuscular electromyography from healthy volunteers during cervical isometric exercises: 1) extension with a pulley rope angled from incline to vertical, 2) extension with right, left and central forehead hanging weight, and 3) rotation with pulley rope angled from incline to decline.",
        "Extension against a vertical force led to greater activation of d-SSC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and s-SC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the inclined, declined and horizontal pulley. With each of these conditions, amplitude of muscle activity was higher for the d-SSC compared to the s-SC muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Extension with free weight hanging on right, left or central forehead, showed no differences across conditions, although in each condition, the d-SSC amplitude was higher than the s-SC. For cervical rotation, the declined pulley led to the greatest activation of both muscles (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Higher levels of activity were observed for the s-SC compared to the d-SSC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for all rotation conditions.",
        "A vertical resistance during an extension exercise or a declined resistance during cervical rotation, increased neck extensor activation. The results from this preliminary study provide guidance for future work on the exploration and development of low-load exercise design for patients with neck pain disorders."
