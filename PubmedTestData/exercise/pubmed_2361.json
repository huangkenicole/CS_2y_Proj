      "AbstractText": [
        "The variation in parameters for childhood metabolic syndrome (MetS) has hindered the development of a consensus for the diagnostic criteria in this group. Despite these inconsistencies, it is accepted that exercise can ameliorate the deleterious effects of MetS. However, direct comparison between aerobic versus resistance exercise on MetS symptomology in adolescents is lacking.",
        "Aim of this review was to discuss controversies associated with current MetS operation definitions in adolescents and present a review summarizing longitudinal studies relevant to the influence of aerobic and resistance training on children with MetS.",
        "Reviews of PubMed and Web of Science were conducted to identify literature focusing on the influence of aerobic and resistance training on children with MetS. Selected manuscripts featured longitudinal research only.",
        "A universally accepted definition of MetS for the pediatric population has yet to be established. As such, consensus regarding diagnostic criteria for MetS among children is lacking despite the presence of various descriptions in the literature. Though studies support the importance of aerobic and resistance exercise to combat comorbidities associated with MetS, longitudinal studies investigating the benefits of each exercise type among adolescents are limited and inconsistent.",
        "An improved understanding of the impact of aerobic and resistance training on children with MetS is clinically relevant because it may facilitate more appropriate exercise recommendations for children with MetS. Additional large cohort studies are warranted to determine optimal exercise type."
