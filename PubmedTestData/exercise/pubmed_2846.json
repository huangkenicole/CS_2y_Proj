      "AbstractText": [
        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder defined by physical symptoms such as hand disability and postural instability. To counteract the detrimental effects of PD, physical activity programs showed improvements in overall aspects of physical functioning. Therefore, this protocol will aim to evaluate the effect a of postural and fine motor skills training program in older adults with PD. PD individuals, with mild to moderate stage PD, aged between 65 to 80 years, will be voluntary selected from the Nursing Home Residences and Rehabilitation Centers. Subsequently, they will be randomly assigned to intervention group (PD) to receive a combined training program (postural control and fine motor skills exercises) or to the Control group (CON) to receive a stretching program. Before (PRE) and after (POST) a 12-week program both groups will perform wobble board (WB) and grooved pegboard (GPT) tests. Different performances between groups will be expected: (1) no significant differences between PD and CON group for WB and GPT test values before the beginning of the training intervention (PRE); (2) significantly better WB and GPT test values in PD subjects after the training intervention (POST) when compared to the base values (PRE); and (3) no significant differences in WB and GPT test values in CON subjects after the training intervention (POST) when compared to the base values (PRE). The findings of the present study protocol could be used for future studies investigating clinical populations, such as PD, and the effects of different rehabilitative interventions aiming to improve postural control and fine motor skills performances assessed by WB and GPT tests."
