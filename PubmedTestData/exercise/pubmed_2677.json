        "The purpose was to determine if an at-home resistance tubing strength training program on one shoulder (that is commonly used in rehabilitation settings) would produce increases in strength in the trained and untrained shoulders via cross-education. Twenty-three participants were randomized to TRAIN (strength-trained one shoulder; n = 13) or CONTROL (no intervention; n = 10). Strength training was completed at home using resistance tubing and consisted of maximal shoulder external rotation, internal rotation, scaption, retraction, and flexion 3 days/week for 4 weeks. Strength was measured via handheld dynamometry and muscle size measured via ultrasound. For external rotation strength, the trained (10.9 \u00b1 10.9%) and untrained (12.7 \u00b1 9.6%) arm of TRAIN was significantly different than CONTROL (1.6 \u00b1 13.2%; -2.7 \u00b1 12.3%; pooled across arm; P < 0.05). For internal rotation strength, the trained (14.8 \u00b1 11.3%) and untrained (14.6 \u00b1 10.1%) arm of TRAIN was significantly different than CONTROL (6.4 \u00b1 11.2%; 5.1 \u00b1 8.8%; pooled across arm; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences for scaption strength (P = 0.056). TRAIN significantly increased muscle size in the training arm of the supraspinatus (1.90 \u00b1 0.32 to 1.99 \u00b1 0.31 cm), and the anterior deltoid (1.08 \u00b1 0.37 to 1.21 \u00b1 0.39 cm; P < 0.05). This study suggests that an at-home resistance tubing training program on one limb can produce increases in strength in both limbs, and has implications for rehabilitation after unilateral shoulder injuries."
