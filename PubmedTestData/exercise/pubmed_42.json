        "Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) is a term used for a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by severe muscle weakness. In addition to pharmacological treatment options, non-pharmacological methods such as exercising are essential for proper management of myositis. The present article aimed to provide an insight into the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying exercise-related benefits in myositis. A systematic search was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the following keywords and their combinations: \"idiopathic inflammatory myopathy\", \"inflammatory myopathy\", \"myositis\", \"polymyositis\", \"dermatomyositis\", \"inclusion body myositis\", and \"exercise\". Current literature indicates that exercising has impact on both immune and non-immune pathways in patients with IIM. Exercise-related benefits include (a) increased mitochondrial biogenesis/enzyme activity, (b) reconditioning of immune/inflammatory pathways, (c) decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress, (d) modulation of gene expression, (e) increased protein synthesis and cytoskeletal remodeling, and (f) decreased muscle fibrosis and non-muscle area infiltrates. With its certain benefits, exercise stands as a precious non-pharmacological treatment option for patients with IIM."
