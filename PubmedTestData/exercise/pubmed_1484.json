        "Although studies suggest that exercise training improves physical performance and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among elderly people, most of these studies have investigated relatively healthy persons. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of a 12-month multicomponent exercise program on physical performance, daily physical activity, and HRQOL among very elderly people with minor disabilities.",
        "The subjects consisted of 65 elders (median age: 84 years) who were certified to receive long-term care in the form of support only or Level 1 care (the lowest level of care required); 31 were allocated to the intervention group and 34 to the control group. The intervention group participated in supervised exercises once a week for 12 months and in home-based exercises. The exercise program consisted of various exercises related to flexibility, muscle strength, balance, and aerobic performance.",
        "After 12 months of exercise training, the intervention group had significant improvements in lower-limb strength and on the sit-and-reach test; these effects were not observed in the control group. The control group had significant decreases in grip strength, 6-minute walking distance, walking speed, and stride length; these decreases were not observed in the intervention group. No clear differences in HRQOL measurements or changes in physical activity were detected between groups.",
        "The 12-month multicomponent exercise program may effectively improve and maintain the physical performance of very elderly individuals with minor disabilities."
