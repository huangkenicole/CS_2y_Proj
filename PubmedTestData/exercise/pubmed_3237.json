        "Technological advances stimulate labor transformations in such a way that the search for productivity, goals and market competitiveness leads industries and companies to neglect the health and safety of their workers. There is a gap in the literature regarding means of intervention using physical exercises (PE), with details remaining unknown in terms of appropriate exercise prescriptions or types that minimize the effects of occupational stress.",
        "to verify the effects on workers' stress of PE performed in the work environment.",
        "this systematic review searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 08 databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane, BIREME, LILACS, EBSCOhost, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Embase), in English and Portuguese, published between 2017 and 2021. The PICOS strategy was used to determine inclusion, being P: male and female workers; I: exercises performed in the work environment; C: control group without intervention; O: occupational stress; and S: controlled experiments. Methodological quality, risk of bias and reliability of assessments were analyzed using the TESTEX, Risk of Bias 2, and Kappa scales.",
        "A total of 07 articles were included, of which, most had good methodological quality and unclear risk of bias. The intra- and inter-rater reliability test of methodological quality showed excellent agreement. As a limitation, the fragility in allocation concealment, blinding and absence of treatment analysis was noted in the studies evaluated.",
        "PE in the workplace might have positive effects on reducing occupational stress, but further studies must be conducted to better clarify this. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022304106)."
