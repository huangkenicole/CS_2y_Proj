        "Physical exercise is considered an effective intervention for maintaining or improving quality of life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but there is no evidence showing which type of physical exercise intervention has more positive effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions on improving QoL in patients with PD, comparing different types of exercise interventions.",
        "A literature search was conducted through January 2022. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool RoB2. For the meta-analysis, physical exercise interventions were classified into 5 training categories: resistance, endurance, alternative exercises, dance, and sensorimotor interventions. A standard meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the different types of physical exercise interventions.",
        "The search retrieved 2451 studies, 48 of which were included in this network meta-analysis with a total of 2977 patients with PD. The indirect effects of the network meta-analysis showed positive results for alternative exercises (-0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.76, -0.16), dance (-0.63; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.17), and sensorimotor interventions (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.40, -0.07) versus control comparisons.",
        "More research is needed to determine the types of physical exercise interventions that are most beneficial and for which conditions of the disease they have the most positive effects.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A398 )."
