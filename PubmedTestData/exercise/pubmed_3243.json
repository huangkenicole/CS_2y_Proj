        "The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of patients with post-COVID-19 condition undergoing supervised therapeutic exercise intervention or following the self-management WHO (World Health Organization) rehabilitation leaflet.",
        "A randomized controlled trial was carried out that included 39 participants with post-COVID-19 condition who had a chronic symptomatic phase lasting >12\u2009weeks. Comprehensive medical screening, patient-reported symptoms, and cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength were assessed. Patients were randomly assigned to a tailored multicomponent exercise program based on concurrent training for 8\u2009weeks (two supervised sessions per week comprised resistance training combined with aerobic training [moderate intensity variable training], plus a third day of monitored light intensity continuous training), or to a control group which followed the WHO guidelines for rehabilitation after COVID-19.",
        "After follow-up, there were changes in physical outcomes in both groups, however, the magnitude of the change pre-post intervention favored the exercise group in cardiovascular and strength markers: VO<sub>2</sub> max\u2009+5.7%, sit-to-stand -22.7% and load-velocity profiles in bench press +6.3%, and half squat +16.9%, (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, exercise intervention resulted in a significantly better quality of life, less fatigue, less depression, and improved functional status, as well as in superior cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No adverse events were observed during the training sessions.",
        "Compared to current WHO recommendations, a supervised, tailored concurrent training at low and moderate intensity for both resistance and endurance training is a more effective, safe, and well-tolerated intervention in post-COVID-19 conditions."
