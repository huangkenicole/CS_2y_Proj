      "AbstractText": [
        "Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic disease of the skeleton characterized by increased risk of fracture. There is a general consensus on the efficacy of physical activity in the prevention of bone loss, falls and fractures, but there is no agreement on the best setting to exercise. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-months exercise protocol for women with post-menopausal OP when administered as individual home training (IHT) versus gym group training (GGT). The study is a randomized trial with two parallel groups. Sedentary patients with primary post-menopausal osteoporosis are recruited at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli of Bologna. In the first group, the 12-month ACTLIFE program is performed as IHT, while in the second as GGT. The program is aimed at improving joint mobility, muscle force, balance, motor coordination and endurance. The study is single blinded. Patients are assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is the modification of quality of life measured with the Short Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ECOS-16). The findings of this study will highlight advantages and disadvantages of exercising in the two different settings and provide evidence on how to increase physical activity in osteoporotic women."
