        "To review the current data regarding the safety of exercise in pregnancy.",
        "MEDLINE search was limited to English literature between 1987 and 1995 with the key MeSH words exercise and pregnancy. Other sources included the Sports and Fitness Database between 1991 and 1995 and a manual search for relevant articles. Previous studies on the safety of exercise in pregnancy are limited in many ways and exhibit difficulties in controlling for confounding factors and in establishing associations while maintaining maternal and fetal safety.",
        "Concerns about the effect of exercise on pregnancy include exercise-induced hyperthermia, birth weight changes, fetal heart rate responses, miscarriage, labour patterns, maternal injury, and maternal weight gain. Exercise during pregnancy also has many potential benefits.",
        "Important gaps in our knowledge of exercise and pregnancy remain. Available data suggest, however, that moderate exercise on a regular basis during a healthy pregnancy has minimal risk for women and their fetuses."
