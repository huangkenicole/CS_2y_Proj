        "Adherence to prehabilitation is crucial for optimal benefit, but reasons for low adherence to home-based programs remain unexplored. Our aim was to identify and explore barriers and facilitators to prehabilitation adherence among patients undergoing abdominal surgery.",
        "Nested in a single-center randomized controlled trial on prehabilitation (Perioperative Optimization With Enhanced Recovery (POWER)), this study had an explanatory sequential design with a connect integration. Patients randomized to the intervention arm were included in the quantitative analysis, and a subset of them was invited for a semi-structured interview. The exposure was the frequency of barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, and the outcome was adherence to those components of prehabilitation. Logistic or linear regression was used as appropriate.",
        "Among 133 participants in the intervention arm, 116 (87.2%) completed the initial survey ((56.9% women, median age 61 years old (IQR 49.0; 69.4)). The most frequent barriers to exercise and healthy eating were medical issues (59%) and lack of motivation (31%), respectively. There was no significant association between the barriers to physical activity score and adherence to this component of the program (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78-1.02, p=0.09). Higher barriers to healthy eating scores were associated with lower Mediterranean diet scores pre- and post-intervention (coef.: -0.32, 95% CI: -0.49; -0.15, p<0.001; and coef.: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.47; -0.07, p=0.01, respectively). Interviews with 15 participants revealed that participating in prehabilitation was a motivator for healthy eating and exercising through goal setting, time-efficient workouts, and promoting self-efficacy.",
        "We identified key barriers to be addressed and facilitators to be leveraged in future prehabilitation programs.",
