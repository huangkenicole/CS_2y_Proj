        "Rosa, A, Coleman, M, Haun, C, Grgic, J, and Schoenfeld, BJ. Repetition performance, rating of perceived discomfort, and blood lactate responses to different rest interval lengths in single-joint and multijoint lower-body exercise. J Strength Cond Res 37(7): 1350-1357, 2023-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different rest interval lengths (RILs) on repetition performance, rating of discomfort, and blood lactate responses during lower-body single-joint and multijoint exercises. This study used a counterbalanced design where each subject performed the Smith machine back squat (BS) and leg extension (LE) using 3 different RIL configurations (1, 2, and 3 minutes) in a randomized fashion. Data collection occurred over the span of 3 separate days. Volunteers were randomly allocated to perform the independent variables (RILs and exercises) in 1 of 12 potential configurations. The initial session was allotted for familiarization with the rating of discomfort scale and 10 repetition maximum testing. The other 2 sessions involved training with the different configurations of RIL length using both the BS and LE. Randomization ensured that the BS was performed first in one of the training sessions and the LE was performed first in the other session. Results indicated that longer RILs had a small positive effect on repetition performance, with longer rest durations allowing for more repetitions compared with shorter durations. The largest difference in repetition performance between RILs was observed between 1 minute and 2-3 minutes rest; there were trivial differences in repetition performance between 2 and 3 minutes rest for both the BS and LE. Blood lactate levels were slightly higher with longer RILs. Overall, BS showed greater increases in blood lactate compared with LE, and these differences were magnified over time. Exercise selection and RIL both influenced rating of discomfort, with LE producing less discomfort than BS and longer RILs reducing perceived discomfort. Our findings suggest that RIL influences the repetition performance, blood lactate, and rating of discomfort responses between single-joint and multijoint exercises."
