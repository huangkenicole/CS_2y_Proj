        "Ambulatory disability and cognitive impairment are common and co-occuring manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). Neurofunctional training is a specific intervention performed in realistic environments that may have beneficial effects on ambulatory disability in persons with MS who have cognitive impairment. This pilot sudy investigated the feasibility and efficacy of an eight-week home-based neurofunctional training (HBNFT) program vs. home-based resistance training (HBRT) on ambulatory performance in MS patients with cognitive impairment.",
        "Thirty males/females with MS (age 18-50 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u2264 6, and processing speed score \u2264 41.5 as a marker of cognitive impairment) were randomly assigned into HBNFT and HBRT groups. After one week (three sessions) of center-based, supervised training for learning the programs and maximizing safety, the participants completed eight weeks (three sessions per week) of the home-based training programs. The programs were supported through videos, brochures and Digital Video Discs (DVDs) provided during clinic visits (weeks 1 and 5). Ambulatory performance (tandem stance test; tandem walk test; timed up-and-go (TUG); six-minute walk test (6MWT), 10-\u00a0meter walking test (10MWT); timed 25 foot walk test (T25FWT); five times sit to stand test (5TSTS); six spot step test (SSST); and hand grip) was measured before and after the exercise programs. Feasibility and acceptability of exercise programs was assessed after the eight-week period.",
        "HBNFT significantly improved tandem walk test (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), SSST (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026), and 6MWT (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037) compared with HBRT. No significant changes or differences were observed in other outcomes (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.05). HBNFT was well tolerated and resulted in no adverse events, whereas there were reports of pain, muscle cramps, and extreme fatigue among HBRT participant.",
        "The current pilot study provided initial support for HBNFT as a safe and feasible approach for improving some aspects of ambulation in persons with MS who have cognitive impairment. Such a pilot study provides initial proof-of-concept data for the design and implementation of an appropriately-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of neuro-functional training vs. traditional resistance exercise in a larger sample of persons with MS who present with co-occurring impairments in mobility and cognition."
