        "<b>Background:</b> The aim of this pilot study was to describe the acceptance and feasibility of an exercise intervention in breast cancer patients of Turkish origin in Austria by using a hand-held swinging-ring system.<b>Methods:</b> The inclusion period lasted 1\u2009year (1 February 2016-31 January 2017). In a multicentre cooperation, Turkish female breast cancer patients were included by using face-to-face information, email, facebook<sup>\u00ae</sup>, phone, and notice boards. The exercise program consisted of 1) supervised and 2) home-based exercise by using the smovey<sup>\u00ae</sup> vibroswing system. Feasibility and acceptance were assessed by using the Austrian school grading system and a qualitative approach after 3\u2009months. Furthermore, the six-minute walk test (6MWT), handgrip strength, body composition (BIA), and health-related quality of life (QOL) were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 3\u2009months (T1).<b>Results:</b> Only 5 breast cancer patients could be included, from whom one dropped out due to breast cancer recurrence. The exercise intervention showed no side effects and was well accepted by all 4 patients. Furthermore, results of the 6MWT, handgrip strength, BIA, and QOL improved.<b>Conclusion:</b> These results indicate notable barriers towards regular physical activity in female Turkish breast cancer patients in Austria. Four out of five of those involved were comfortable with the intervention. Therefore, it seems to be essential to further address these barriers in order to plan and implement effective interventions.Implications for RehabilitationExercise is an effective means of improving health and quality of life experienced by female patients suffering from breast cancer.Although extensive efforts were taken only a minority of Turkish female patients attended a structured exercise program.It seems to be essential to further address barriers to exercise in order to plan and implement effective interventions."
