        "Cancer survivorship care plans (\"care plans\") often recommend an active lifestyle yet are rarely accompanied by programs to help patients enact the prescribed behavior change. As a step towards bridging this gap, this trial tested the feasibility of augmenting care planning with a multi-level physical activity intervention.",
        "Breast and colorectal cancer survivors were enrolled alongside a self-selected support partner (e.g., spouse, friend). Survivors received a care plan alone (comparison group) versus one augmented with a 12-week physical activity module (intervention group). For the intervention group dyads, both members received a multi-component program including Fitbit trackers, with the survivor's Fitbit linked to his/her electronic health record (EHR). Treating clinicians received periodic updates regarding the survivors' physical activity. The primary outcome was ActiGraph-measured physical activity, analyzed using mixed models. Feedback questionnaires were administered to participants and clinicians at 12\u00a0weeks.",
        "Survivors (n\u2009=\u200950) were 54.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u00a0years of age and 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0years post-diagnosis. Survivors in the intervention group increased moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) by 69\u2009\u00b1\u200984\u00a0min/week vs. a 20\u2009\u00b1\u200971\u00a0min/week decrease in the comparison group (p\u2009=\u2009.001). Likewise, daily steps increased by 1470\u2009\u00b1\u20091881 vs. a 398\u2009\u00b1\u20091751 decrease (P\u2009=\u2009.002). Among responding clinicians, 100% looked at survivors' activity data within the EHR at least once and 80% said it provided insight into their patients' lifestyles.",
        "Augmenting a standard care plan with a multi-level, technology-based intervention increased physical activity among cancer survivors.",
        "Technology-based approaches, including activity trackers, can be used by individuals to work towards an active lifestyle after cancer."
