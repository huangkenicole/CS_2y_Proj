        "The objective of this pilot study was to address the influence of an aerobic exercise program combined with relaxation on pain and psychological variables in migraine patients.",
        "Controlled, randomised design with half of the group receiving an intervention (aerobic exercise group) in addition to standard medical care received by all patients. SETTING/PATIENTS/OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Thirty female migraine outpatients completed a range of psychological questionnaires measuring sensational and affective dimensions of pain, body image, depression, and quality of life.",
        "The aerobic exercise group (n = 15) participated in a 6-week, twice-weekly, indoor exercise program (45 minutes of gymnastics with music and 15 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation).",
        "The program led to a significant reduction of self-rated migraine pain intensity. Although there was an improvement in depression-related symptoms within the aerobic exercise group, no significant differences in psychological variables between groups were found."
