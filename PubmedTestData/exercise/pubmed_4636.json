        "Exercise training has positive effects on motor and cognitive performance which deteriorates over time in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The effects of task-oriented circuit training (TOCT) on motor and cognitive performance in patients with MS are not yet clear.",
        "The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of TOCT on balance, walking, manual dexterity, cognitive performance, and to determine the extent to which patients are able to transfer changes in their performance to activities of daily living.",
        "Twenty patients with MS (EDSS: 2-5.5), were randomly assigned to two groups; the task-oriented circuit training group (TOCTG, n:10) and the control group (CG, n:10). The TOCTG received TOCT twice a week for six weeks while the CG performed the relaxation exercises at home. All patients were assessed by using Modified Sensory Organization Test, Berg Balance Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, Timed Up and Go, Functional Gait Assessment, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, Nine-Hole Peg Test, Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests, Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Questionnaire.",
        "Balance and walking performance were improved after TOCT (p\u200a<\u200a0.05), whereas manual dexterity and cognitive performance except for verbal memory did not change significantly (p\u200a>\u200a0.05). The CG showed no changes in any measurements (p\u200a>\u200a0.05).",
        "TOCT is quite effective to improve balance and walking in patients with MS. However, further studies are needed to determine the effect of TOCT on cognitive performance."
