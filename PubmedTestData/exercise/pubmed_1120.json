        "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and by far the most frequent cancer among women.",
        "This study was conducted to observe the effect of progressive relaxation exercises on anxiety and comfort level of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",
        "A control group pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental model was applied with experimental (30) and control (30) groups, who agreed to participate in this study. Data collection was with the \"Personnel Information Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and General Comfort Scale\".",
        "The average age of the patients that participated in the study was 49.1\u00b17.96 years. Eighty-three point three percent (n=25) of the patients in the experiment group and 86.7 (n=26) percent of patients in control group were married. Patient state of anxiety post-test mean scores were 36.2\u00b18.21 in the experimental group and 43.4\u00b17.96 in the control group, the difference being statistically significant (p<0.05). The general comfort scale post-test mean scores were 149.5\u00b113.9 in the experimental group and 137.7\u00b115.0 in the control group, again statistically significant (p<0.05).",
