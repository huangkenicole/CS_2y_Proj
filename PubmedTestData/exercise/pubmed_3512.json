        "The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders affecting bones, joints, and muscles is dramatically increasing in parallel with the increased longevity of the worldwide population, severely impacting on the individual's quality of life and on the healthcare costs. Inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are nowadays considered the main drivers of age-associated musculoskeletal disorders and exercise may counteract such alterations also in other bone- and muscle-centered disorders. This review aims at clarifying the potential use of exercise training to improve musculoskeletal health.",
        "Both the skeletal muscle and the bone are involved in a complex crosstalk determining, in part through tissue-specific and inflammatory/immune released factors, the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders. Exercise is able to modulate the levels of those molecules and several associated molecular pathways. Evidence from preclinical and clinical trials supports the adoption of exercise and the future use of exercise mimicking drugs will optimize the care of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders."
