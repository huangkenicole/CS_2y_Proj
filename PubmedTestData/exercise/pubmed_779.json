        "A mixed-methods approach was used to study an individually-tailored community exercise program for people with a range of chronic neurological conditions (e.g.,\u00a0stroke, spinal cord injury, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease) and abilities. The program was delivered to older adults (mean age: 62 \u00b1 9\u00a0years) with chronic neurological conditions across a 12-week and an 8-week term. Participants attended 88% of sessions and completed 89% of prescribed exercises in those sessions. There were no adverse events. Clinically important improvements were achieved by all evaluated participants (n = 8) in at least one testing domain (grip strength, lower-extremity strength, aerobic endurance, and balance). Interviews with participants identified key program elements as support through supervision, social connection, individualized programming, and experiential learning. Findings provide insight into elements that enable a community exercise program to meet the needs of a complex and varied group. Further study will support positive long-term outcomes for people aging with neurological conditions."
