        "Cancer therapy diminishes strength and physical function in cancer survivors. Whether oncology rehabilitation (OR) exercise training following therapy can correct these deficits, and whether its effectiveness differs by age, is not clear. We examine the utility of a clinically based, 12-week, combined aerobic and resistance training intervention on muscle strength and physical function in two age groups of cancer survivors.",
        "Strength and physical function measures were assessed in middle-aged (45 to 64 years) and older (\u2265 65 years) patients following treatment for stage 0-III cancer before and after the OR training program.",
        "Older patients had lower physical function compared to middle-aged patients across a range of subjective and objective measures at baseline, and exercise improved all indices of physical function and strength in both age groups. Compared to the middle-aged individuals, older participants tended to have less improvement leg strength and the 5 time sit to stand (5TSTS) test as a result of OR. In models predicting post-intervention measures, older age contributed to less improvement in walking distance and power as well as the 5TSTS test.",
        "Prior to beginning the OR exercise program, middle-aged patients had higher physical function compared to older patients. However, a 12-week aerobic and resistance training intervention improved physical function across both age groups, although older age did limit responsiveness in some physical function measures. The physical function and strength of middle-aged and older cancer survivors improve in response to an exercise-based OR program after cancer treatment."
