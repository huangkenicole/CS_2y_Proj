        "To evaluate the effects of progressive resistance and balance (PRB) exercises on physical and psychological functions of post-stroke individuals.",
        "In a randomized controlled trial with follow-up at 3, 6 and 15 months, 67 community-living individuals (76% male; 65-85 years) with a stroke 1-3 years previously were allocated to an intervention group (IG, n\u2009=\u200934; PRB exercises combined with motivational group discussions twice weekly for 3 months) or a control group (CG, n\u2009=\u200933). The primary outcomes were balance (Berg Balance Scale, 0-56 points) and mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery, 0-12 points) at 3 months. The secondary outcomes were 10 m comfortable walking speed, physical activity levels, health-related quality of life, depression and fall-related self-efficacy.",
        "At 3 months, the IG exhibited significant improvements in balance (MD 2.5 versus 0 points; effect size [ES], 0.72; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and comfortable walking speed (MD 0.04 versus -0.05 m/s; ES, 0.68; p\u2009=\u20090.01) relative to the CG. A faster walking speed persisted at 6 months. No differences were found for the other outcomes.",
        "In chronic stroke patients, 3 months of PRB exercises and motivational discussions induced improvements in balance at 3 months and in walking speed at 3 and 6 months. Implications for Rehabilitation A progressive resistance and balance exercise program supported by motivational group discussions and one home-based exercise appears to be an effective means of improving the short-term balance and the walking speed in individuals with chronic stroke. People with poor balance and motor function discontinued the study more often and may require additional support. There is a need for powerful and cost-effective strategies that target changes in behavior to obtain long-term changes in physical function after exercising."
