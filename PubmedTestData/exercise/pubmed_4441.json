        "<b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To investigate the effects of digital rehabilitation for improving adherence to therapeutic exercise in people with musculoskeletal conditions. <b>DESIGN:</b> Intervention systematic review with meta-analysis. <b>LITERATURE SEARCH:</b> Five databases were searched from their inception to March 2022. <b>STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA:</b> We included randomized controlled trials evaluating digital rehabilitation programs to improve adherence to therapeutic exercise for people with musculoskeletal conditions. <b>DATA SYNTHESIS:</b> We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) or mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. <b>RESULTS:</b> Eleven trials were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1144 participants). At short-term follow-up, digital rehabilitation was no better than nondigital rehabilitation (3 trials, adherence rate of prescribed exercise test SMD 0.50, 95% CI: -0.13, 1.13; 2 trials, self-reported exercise adherence test MD 1.07, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.56; 2 trials, assessor-reported exercise adherence test SMD -0.10, 95% CI: -0.56, 0.36). At intermediate-term follow-up, digital rehabilitation improved exercise adherence compared with nondigital rehabilitation (6 trials, adherence rate of prescribed exercise test SMD 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.70; 2 trials, self-reported exercise adherence test MD 1.50, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.25; 2 trials, Exercise Adherence Rating Scale test MD 5.86, 95% CI: 0.08, 11.65). At long-term follow-up, there was no clinically important difference between digital and nondigital rehabilitation (2 trials, adherence rate of prescribed exercise test SMD 0.28, 95% CI: -0.14, 0.70; 1 trial, self-reported exercise adherence test MD 0.20, 95% CI: -0.91, 1.31). <b>CONCLUSION:</b> Digital rehabilitation was effective at improving therapeutic exercise adherence in musculoskeletal conditions at mid-term follow-up, but not at short- and long-term follow-up. <i>J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(11):726-739.
