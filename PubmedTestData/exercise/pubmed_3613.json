        "After the stroke, a number of changes occur in the neuromuscular system functions.",
        "To determine whether the water based exercise (WBE) program applied in combination with the land-based exercises (LBE) compared to LBE alone contributes to the stroke patients' motor functions, walking, balance functions and quality of life (QoL).",
        "In total, 60 patients participated in this study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. WBE therapy (3/week) + LBE (2/week) combination was applied to the patients in the study group (n = 30) for six weeks. LBE was applied to the control group (n = 30) 5/week for six weeks. Patients were evaluated before and after the treatment. Functional independence measurement, Berg balance scale, timed up and go test, and short form (SF) -36 assessment questionnaire were performed.",
        "Posttreatment results showed significant improvements in all of the parameters (except SF - 36 pain parameter) in both groups. The improvement in the vitality parameter of SF-36 was higher in the study group (p < 0.05), and improvement in the BBS was significantly higher in the LBE group than the WBE group (p < 0.05).",
        "Applying WBE together with the LBE (except SF-36 vitality sub-parameter) in patients with hemiplegia did not make any additional contribution to the application of LBE alone."
