        "Objective was to determine whether physical activity reduces the severity of fatigue in patients with cancer or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.",
        "We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing physical activity with control interventions for the management of fatigue in patients with cancer or HSCT recipients.",
        "There were 170 trials included. Physical activity reduced the severity of fatigue when compared to all control groups (standardized mean difference -0.49, 95% confidence interval -0.60 to -0.37; P\u202f<\u202f0.00001). Aerobic, neuromotor, resistance and combination exercises were all effective in reducing fatigue although smaller effects were observed with resistance exercises (P interaction\u202f=\u202f0.01). Other intervention and patient characteristics did not influence the effect of physical activity on the severity of fatigue.",
        "Physical activity was effective at reducing fatigue in patients with cancer and HSCT recipients across patient sub-groups. Determining the best approaches for safe implementation should be a priority."
