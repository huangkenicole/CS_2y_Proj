        "This study aimed to examine adherence to the weekly physical activity guidelines (\u2265150 min of aerobic activities at moderate-to-vigorous intensity and two or more sessions of strength training (yes or no)) and health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic for men living with obesity, 46 wk after being offered an online muscle-strengthening circuit program for 12 wk.",
        "Sixty men (age \u226519 yr) living with obesity (body fat percentage \u226525%) were randomly assigned to the intervention group ( n = 30) or the control condition ( n = 30) for 12 wk. The intervention group was offered an online circuit training, three sessions per week, whereas the control group received a website helping them to reach the physical activity guidelines. Adherence to the weekly physical activity guidelines was evaluated 46 wk after enrolling in the program using a heart rate tracker (Fitbit Charge 3) and an exercise log. Health outcomes (e.g., anthropometrics, body composition) were measured at baseline and after 12, 24, and 46 wk.",
        "The intervention group had higher adherence to physical activity guidelines at 46 wk (36.8%) than the control group (5.3%; P = 0.02). However, no difference in health outcomes was observed between participants in the intervention group compared with the control group after 12, 24, and 46 wk.",
        "Increasing adherence to exercise in men living with obesity is challenging. The proposed program increased adherence to the physical activity guidelines after about a year for men living with obesity; however, more studies are needed to understand how to improve health outcomes when following an online delivery exercise program in this population."
