        "Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR) and arterio-venous O2 difference (a-vO2diff) responses to heavy and severe-intensity exercise have been well documented; however, there is a lack of information on the SV, HR and a v-O2diff responses of work rates within extreme exercise domain. The aim of this study was, therefore, to focus on central and peripheral components of VO2 responses to exercises performed within the heavy, severe and extreme exercise domain. Eight well-trained male cyclists participated in this study. Maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) and corresponding work rate (P@VO2max) were determined by multisession constant work rate exercises. Cardiovascular responses to exercises were evaluated by nitrous-oxide rebreathing method with work rates from 40 % to 160 % of P@VO2max, VO2max corresponded to 324+/-39.4 W; however, maximal SV responses occurred at 205+/-54.3 W (p<0.01). Maximal cardiac output (Q), HR, and a vO2diff responses were revealed by the P@VO2max. VO2 response to exercise significantly decreased from severe-intense exercises to the first work rate of extreme exercise domain due to significant decreases in Q, SV, and HR responses (p<0.05), except a v-O2diff (p>0.05). Moreover, non-significant decreases in Q, SV, and a v-O2diff were evaluated as response to increase in work rate belonging to extreme work rates (p>0.05), except the HR (p<0.05). Work rates within the lower district of the extreme exercise domain have an important potential to improve peripheral component of VO2, while the P@VO2max seems the most appropriate intensity for aerobic endurance development as it maximizes the central component of VO2max."
