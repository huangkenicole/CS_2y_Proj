        "A meta-analysis was performed to determine impact of resistance and aerobic exercise on body fat of obese population. Database of Google Scholar, BioMed Central, and Medline was reconnoitered for the purpose of research article of interest. Inclusion criteria encompass all those studies in which effects of aerobic and resistance exercise were determined on body fat mass of obese participants. Studies in which combination of aerobic and resistance exercise were used, or outcome measures were other than body fat mass or studies conducted before 2010 were excluded from this review. A total of 805 obese participants were included in 10 randomized controlled trials (RCT) including 401 in resistance training protocol and 404 in aerobic training protocol were part of this meta-analysis. Results revealed that resistance exercise had a mild pool affect in increasing weight of participants with an effect size (SMD) of 0.26 (95% of CI -0.09 to 0.63) calculated at random effect model, I2 83.80% (95% of CI 71.76 to 90.71) in comparison to aerobic exercises performed during the duration of two to eight weeks of training protocol. The meta-analysis concluded that resistance exercises had a mild pool effect in increasing the weight of the participants in comparison to aerobic exercises. Key Words: Aerobic exercises, Resistance exercises, Obesity, Fat mass, Body fat index and body fat composition."
