        "In the past, older adults were traditionally deemed too weak or fragile to participate in high-intensity exercise, but more recent research indicates that not only is high-intensity exercise not dangerous in this population, but it may in fact be a preferable form of exercise over other, less-intense alternatives. However, many seniors still do not participate in high-intensity exercise despite the mounting evidence that it can improve a number of physiological functions and ultimately increase quality of life. As health, sport, and medical professionals, we must continuously ask ourselves how we can apply our lab-based findings in real-life scenarios, and in the case of older adults, we must find a way to circumvent some of their most common reasons for not exercising, which can include a lack of time, a lack of know-how, a lack of motivation, a fear that high-intensity exercise is unsafe, and a perception that high-intensity exercise is too difficult. Therefore, introducing quick, simple, safe, and perceptually easy exercises may result in immediate health and functional benefits and may serve as a gateway exercise to usher older adults into the realm of high-intensity training. Specifically, assisted jumping could serve this purpose. In this article, the ideas behind the theory and practice of assisted jumping are set forth, providing an evidence-based hypothesis from which future researchers can build on to implement high-speed, high-power, high-intensity exercise in older populations in both research and practical settings."
