        "Reactive postural control is an important component of the balance function for fall prevention. Perturbation-based balance exercises improve reactive postural control; however, these exercises require large, complex instruments and expert medical guidance. This study investigates the effects of unexpected perturbation-based balance exercises using a wearable balance exercise device (WBED) on reactive postural control. Eighteen healthy adult males participated in this study. Participants were assigned to the WBED and Sham groups. In the intervention session, participants in the WBED group randomly underwent unexpected perturbation in the mediolateral direction, while the Sham group performed the same exercises without perturbation. Before and after the intervention session, all participants underwent evaluation of reactive balance function using air cylinders. Peak displacement (D), time at peak displacement (T), peak velocity (V), and root mean square (RMS) of center of pressure (COP) data were measured. For mediolateral and anteroposterior COP (COPML and COP[Formula: see text]), the main effects of group and time factors (pre/post) were investigated through the analysis of variance for split-plot factorial design. In the WBED group, the D-COPML and V-COPML of the post-test significantly decreased compared to those of the pre-test (p = 0.017 and p = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, the D-COPAP and RMSAP of the post-test significantly decreased compared to those of the pre-test (p = 0.036 and p = 0.015, respectively). This study proved that the perturbation-based balance exercise using WBED immediately improved reactive postural control. Therefore, wearable exercise devices, such as WBED, may contribute to the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries."
