      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Physical activity is essential for adolescents to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of an 8-week exercise program and motivation on physical activity levels, self-motivation, and mental well-being of adolescents in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the impact of virtual coaching on physical, emotional, and mental health after an eight-week exercise program was examined. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Twenty-seven participants, 18 females (67%) and 9 males (33%), with a mean age of 14 \u00b1 2.38 years, were enrolled in eight weeks of pre- and post-intervention between June and August of 2021. The physical activity scale, situational motivation scale, mental health continuum short form, and baseline assessments were completed before and after the eight-week program. The program recommended that adolescents practice aerobic, resistance, and weight-bearing exercises for 60 min daily. Paired mean t-tests were used to compare pre-and post-test results. <i>Results:</i> Participants showed an acceptable physical activity level (5.5 \u00b1 1.4) on a 10-point scale with a significant improvement after the eight-week program (7 \u00b1 1.5; <i>p</i> = 0.013). The situational motivation scale improved from 38.1 \u00b1 16 to 26 \u00b1 19.6 (<i>p</i> = 0.042). The mental health continuum (social and psychological well-being) also significantly improved. Participants who received weekly phone calls showed similar improvement patterns but were not significantly different from those who did not receive calls. <i>Conclusions:</i> A virtually delivered 8-week exercise program for adolescents improved their physical, motivational, and mental health. Providing additional weekly phone calls does not provide additional improvement. Providing adolescents with the needed supervision and motivation enhances their physical activity and mental health."
