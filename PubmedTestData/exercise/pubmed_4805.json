        "This research was conducted to determine the effect of an exercise program on functional remission and weight control in schizophrenia. This experimental study was conducted with pre-posttests and a control group at community mental health centers with 32 individuals with schizophrenia. The individuals participating in the program registered a more significant increase on the functional remission levels compared to the control group and a significant difference was found between the pretest/posttest BMI measures of the experimental group. The nurse-led exercise program is an effective plan that can be used in achieving functional remission."
