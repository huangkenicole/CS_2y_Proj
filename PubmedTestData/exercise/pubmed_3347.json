        "Using a formative evaluation of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention, we illustrate how qualitative data can inform the development of workplace exercise interventions.",
        "Eight focus groups and four interviews were conducted with employees (n\u200a=\u200a38) and management (n\u200a=\u200a4) from six office-based organisations before intervention implementation.",
        "Some participants thought workplace-based HIIT would be practical, given the limited time required. Others perceived it may not be acceptable for all individuals, given the exercise intensity. With consideration of identified barriers (workload/family commitments effecting time availability) and facilitators (flexible working conditions) participants' perspectives were incorporated into the intervention protocol. A short-term group-based intervention was preferred, with a choice of exercise modes (based on stair climbing, stepping or boxing).",
        "This study provides a framework to incorporate stakeholders' perspectives into the development of workplace exercise interventions."
