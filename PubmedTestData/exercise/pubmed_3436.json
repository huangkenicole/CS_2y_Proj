        "Piepoli, A, Miras-Moreno, S, Janicijevic, D, Mart\u00ednez-Amat, A, and Garc\u00eda-Ramos, A. Differences in various strength manifestations between the flat and retracted bench press variants: are they affected by subjects' experience or strength levels? J Strength Cond Res 37(12): 2339-2345, 2023. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of retracting the scapulae during the free-weight bench press (BP) exercise on various strength manifestations and perceptual variables. Twenty-eight recreationally trained male lifters (BP 1-repetition maximum [1RM] = 96.1 \u00b1 20.8 kg) randomly performed in 2 different sessions: the flat BP (scapulae free to move during the movement) and retracted BP (shoulders retracted during the movement). Three strength manifestations were evaluated: (a) explosive strength -mean velocity (MV) achieved against 3 submaximal loads (40, 60, and 80%1RM); (b) maximal strength -1RM; and (c) endurance strength -number of repetitions completed to failure against the 70%1RM. Discomfort and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) values were also recorded immediately after completing each test. The upward displacement of the barbell was lower for the retracted BP compared with the flat BP at the 3 submaximal loads ( p \u2264 0.024), but no significant differences between the BP variants were observed for the MV at submaximal loads ( p \u2265 0.473), 1RM ( p = 0.147), number of repetitions completed to failure ( p = 0.447), RPE at submaximal loads ( p \u2265 0.363), or discomfort during any test ( p \u2265 0.611). Subjects always demonstrated a greater strength performance with the BP variant most used in their training programs, but the differences between the flat and retracted BP were not affected by subjects' maximal strength values ( p \u2265 0.162). These results suggest that retracting the scapulae during the BP exercise presents minor effects on different strength manifestations and perceptual measures of effort and discomfort."
