        "To investigate the efficacy of exercise interventions and factors associated with changes in work ability for people with chronic whiplash-associated disorders.",

        "Interventions were conducted in Swedish primary care settings.",
        "A total of 165 individuals with chronic whiplash-associated disorders grade II-III.",
        "Participants were randomly allocated to neck-specific exercise, neck-specific exercise with a behavioural approach, or prescribed physical activity interventions. Work ability was evaluated with the Work Ability Index at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.",
        "The neck-specific exercise with a behavioural approach intervention significantly improved work ability compared with the prescribed physical activity intervention (3 months, p\u2009=\u20090.03; 6 months, p\u2009=\u20090.01; 12 months, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and neck-specific exercise at 12 months (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Neck-specific exercise was better than the prescribed physical activity intervention at 6 months (p\u2009=\u20090.05). An increase in work ability from baseline to one year for the neck-specific exercise with a behavioural approach group (p<\u20090.01) was the only significant within-group difference. Higher self-rated physical demands at work, greater disability, greater depression and poorer financial situation were associated with poorer work ability (p<0.01).",
        "This study found that neck-specific exercise with a behavioural approach intervention was better at improving self-reported work ability than neck-specific exercise or prescribed physical activity. Improvement in work ability is associated with a variety of factors."
