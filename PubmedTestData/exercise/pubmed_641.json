        "Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE) and Biomechanical Ankle Platform System (BAPS) are two of the protocols available in managing children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). The comparative effects of these modalities on selected functional indices of ambulatory type CP were the focus of this study.",
        "Twenty-eight children with hemiplegic or diplegic CP receiving care at a tertiary health facility in Ibadan were consecutively recruited. They were systematically assigned into two intervention groups. Namely PRE, BAPS. Both groups received intervention twice weekly for 16 weeks. At baseline, 8 and 16 weeks of intervention balance and functional mobility were assessed using Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and modified timed-up-and-go test (TUG) respectively. Chi-square, Fisher's Exact tests, One way and repeated measures ANOVA were carried out. Level of significance (p) was set at 0.05.",
        "There were significant differences in the functional indices of participants in the BAPS group at the end of the intervention (p < 0.05). The two groups (BAPS and PRE) were not significantly different at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks (p > 0.05). All outcome measures increased in both groups from baseline to the end of the intervention period.",
        "The two intervention protocols demonstrated improvements in the areas assessed. Comparatively, both PRE and BAPS could be used to promote function in CP."
