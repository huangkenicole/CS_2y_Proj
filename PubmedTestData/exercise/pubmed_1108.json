        "Patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) experience muscle weakness, tiredness, and loss of energy, which restrict their abilities in performance of their daily living activities.",
        "To explore the effect of aquatic-based plyometric (Aqua-PLYO) exercises on muscle strength, fatigue, and functional ability in patients with JDM.",
        "This was a randomized, single-blind, crossover pilot study that included 16 patients with JDM (age 13.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.85\u00a0years). They were assigned randomly to receive either the Aqua-PLYO exercises (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or the standard outpatient care (SoC ; n\u00a0=\u00a08) first. After a 1-month washout, the treatment was reversed. Lower limb muscle strength, fatigue perception, functional ability, and disease activity were evaluated before and after each treatment period.",
        "Irrespective of the treatment order, the Aqua-PLYO treatment yielded greater improvement in muscle strength (hip flexors and abductors [P\u00a0<\u00a00.001] or knee flexors [P\u00a0<\u00a00.001] and extensors [P\u00a0=\u00a00.0008]), fatigue perception (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), functional ability (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and disease activity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) than the SoC treatment. By using the shortest confidence intervals (100[1-2\u03b1]%) of the difference, the average bioequivalence of the Aqua-PLYO and SoC has not been established at P\u00a0=\u00a00.05, because the upper and lower confidence bounds of all outcomes were not between the acceptance limits. No period or carryover effects were detected in all outcomes.",
        "The Aqua-PLYO exercise protocol as implemented in this study is safe, feasible, and well-tolerated in patients with JDM and seemingly useful to help increase muscle strength, reduce fatigue, and enhance functional ability in such a patient population."
