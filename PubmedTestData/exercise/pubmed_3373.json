        "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients' experiences of a supervised jaw-neck exercise programme. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The study used a mixed method design. All patients were diagnosed with myalgia according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD and divided into local myalgia (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200950; 38 women, mean age 43 yrs, SD 14), and myalgia with generalized pain (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200928; 27 women, mean age 43 yrs, SD 13). Patients participated in a ten-session supervised exercise programme that included relaxation, coordination and resistance training of the jaw, neck and shoulders. After the 10 sessions an evaluation form was filled out including both open- and closed-ended questions. The quantitative analysis was based on closed-ended questions concerned experience, adaptation and side-effects from the exercise programme. The qualitative analysis was employing inductive content analysis of open-ended questions. <b>Results:</b> Patients reported similar positive overall experiences of exercise regardless of diagnosis, although more individuals in the general pain group experienced pain during training (57%) compared to the local pain group (26%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.015). Patients in both groups shared similar experiences and acknowledged the possibility to participate in an individualized and demanding exercise programme. They expressed feelings of being noticed, taken seriously and respectful care management to be key factors for successful treatment outcome. The exercise programme was acknowledged as a valuable part of treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> The hypothesis generated was that individualized and gradually demanding exercise in the rehabilitation process of TMD stimulates self-efficacy and confidence in chronic TMD patients regardless of whether the pain was localized or combined with wide-spread pain."
