        "BACKGROUND This study aimed to quantify the outcomes of combining Schroth and Pilates exercises on the Cobb angle, angle of trunk rotation (ATR), chest expansion, flexibility (trunk flexion), and quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with mild and moderate idiopathic scoliosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-nine adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis aged 10-17 years, presenting with a Cobb angle of 10-45\u00ba were enrolled in this study. The treatment protocol, including selected exercises from Schroth and Pilates methods, was performed over 24 weeks and consisted of 2 periods of 2-week treatment regimens performed daily for 60 minutes. Each of treatment periods was then followed by the same home program treatment for 10 weeks. Cobb angle (x-rays), ATR (Scoliometer), chest expansion (cm), trunk flexion (cm, distance between C7 to S2 with measuring tape), and QoL (SRS-22r Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire) were assessed pre-treatment, at 12 week, and at 24 weeks. RESULTS Significant improvements (P<0.05) were found in both groups of patients wearing and not wearing a brace for Cobb angle (from 21.97\u00b14.99\u00b0 to 18.11\u00b16.39\u00b0; from 14.19\u00b13.11\u00b0 to 11.66\u00b12.73\u00b0), angle of trunk rotation (from 7.19\u00b11.36\u00b0 to 5.36\u00b11.66\u00b0; from 4.72\u00b11.04\u00b0 to 3.58\u00b10.94\u00b0), chest expansion (from 2.56\u00b10.84 cm to 3.46\u00b10.72 cm; from 2.57\u00b10.87 cm to 3.52\u00b10.72 cm), trunk flexion (from 9.55\u00b11.95 cm to 14.33\u00b12.40 cm; from 9.82\u00b12.61 cm to 13.98\u00b12.18 cm) and QoL (from 3.50\u00b10.27 to 3.82\u00b10.2; from 3.42\u00b10.24 to 3.78\u00b10.23) respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that combined exercises provided benefit on the Cobb angle, ATR, chest expansion, trunk flexion and QoL in adolescents with mild and moderate idiopathic scoliosis."
