        "To compare the effects of game-based chin-tuck against resistance exercise and head-lift exercise on swallowing function and compliance of patients with dysphagia after stroke.",
        "A total of 37 patients with stroke were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The experimental group performed game-based chin tuck against resistance exercise, whereas the control group performed traditional head-lift exercise. The videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) were used to evaluate swallowing function. In addition, the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was used for dietary assessment. Finally, the numerical rating self-report scale was used to assess compliance (motivation, interest/enjoyment, physical effort needed, muscle fatigue) with the 2 exercises.",
        "After intervention, there was no significant difference in VDS, PAS, and FOIS between the 2 groups. Comparing the compliance with the 2 exercises, the scores for motivation and interest/enjoyment items were significantly higher, and the scores for physical effort needed and muscle fatigue were significantly lower, in the experimental group than in the control group.",
        "Game-based chin-tuck against resistance exercise not only has a similar effect to head-lift exercise on swallowing function of patients with dysphagia, but is also a less strict and more enjoyable and interesting method."
