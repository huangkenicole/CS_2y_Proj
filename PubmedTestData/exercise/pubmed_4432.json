        "A routine of regular exercise is important in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Most patients with stage I and stage II RA are capable of engaging in an exercise program. Benefits include increased cardiovascular and muscle endurance, as well as improved muscle strength (Table 1). This in turn allows patients to function more independently and with an improved quality of life. Exercise programs are designed to restore range of motion, improve strength and endurance, and at the same time provide a social outlet and opportunity for improved self esteem. Exercises should progress slowly during which time patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of increased joint inflammation."
