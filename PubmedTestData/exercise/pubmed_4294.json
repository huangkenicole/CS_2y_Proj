        "NCAA strength and conditioning coaches are responsible for the day-to-day conditioning and strength training of collegiate athletes. NCAA regulations will likely require all strength and conditioning coaches to have a strength and conditioning certification. NCAA strength and conditioning coaches have varied philosophies on exercise programming based on educational background. The study aims to further evaluate the backgrounds and exercise philosophies of NCAA strength and conditioning coaches.",
        "A survey (Survey Monkey\u00ae, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was distributed to NCAA strength and conditioning professionals to evaluate their education background, current practice trends, use of specific equipment and footwear, and what injuries occurred during sessions.",
        "Of the 208 survey participants, 77.9% were male with an average age of 34.5\u00b19.1 years old. An exercise-related bachelor's degree was held by 80.4% and an exercise-related master's degree by 72.4%. Over 89% had a strength and conditioning certification. Having a master's, bachelor's, or type strength and conditioning certification had no difference in 1-repetition maximal practice with athletes. Lower extremity injuries made up the highest percentage (58.9%) of injuries seen by NCAA Strength and Conditioning Coaches than lumbar spine injuries (16.7%). The five most common injuries reported during workouts were lumbar strain (N.=431, 14.7%), hamstring strain (N.=332, 11.3%), ankle sprain (N.=299, 10.2%), patellar tendonitis (N.=232, 7.9%), and shin splints (N.=226, 7.7%).",
