        "People with hand osteoarthritis (OA) may benefit from resistance training interventions. To date the feasibility of a such interventions for symptomatic hand OA, as per international guidelines, is unknown.",
        "Determine the feasibility of a clinical trial comparing resistance training to an advice only control group in people with symptomatic hand OA.",
        "Single-blind, randomised, controlled feasibility study.",
        "The American College of Rheumatology criteria for hand OA were utilised for inclusion. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to advice and blood flow restriction training (BFRT), advice and traditional high intensity training (HIT), or advice only (control). Participants receiving BFRT and HIT underwent supervised hand exercises three times a week for six weeks. Feasibility measures included recruitment rate, adherence, exercise induced pain, training acceptability, pain flares, and adverse events. Number of treatment responders, pain, grip strength, and hand function were also recorded.",
        "In total, 191 participants were screened, 59 (31%) were included. Retention rate was 89% for BFRT and 79% for HIT. Exercise did not worsen pain following training sessions, and training acceptability was equal between groups. Pain flares occurred in 1.6% (BFRT) and 4% (HIT) out of all the training sessions. There was one adverse event in the HIT group, with the participants withdrawing from the study due to pain. The number of treatment responders, and improvements in pain, were greater with BFRT and HIT. Grip and function did not improve.",
