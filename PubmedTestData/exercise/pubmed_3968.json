        "Thirty-nine healthy women (59.5 +/- 0.9 yr) were randomized to either a control group (CON) or a progressive resistance training group (PRT) that trained twice weekly for 12 months. PRT trained at 80% or more (average of 84%) of their most recent one repetition maximum (1RM) on the lateral pull-down (LPD), knee extensor (KE), and double leg press (DLP) apparatus. One RM was measured for each exercise once monthly in PRT and at baseline, midstudy, and end of study in CON. One RM significantly increased in PRT for all muscle groups trained compared to CON (P < 0.0001). Increases of 73.7 +/- 12%, 35.1 +/- 3%, and 77.0 +/- 5%, respectively, for KE, DLP, and LPD in PRT and 12.7% +/- 8%, 3.7% +/- 3%, and 18.4% +/- 4%, respectively, in CON were observed. Approximately 50% of the gains in KE and LPD and 40% in the DLP were seen in the first 3 months of the study. In all three exercises, strength gains in PRT continued over the entire 12-month period. These data indicate that high-intensity strength training results in substantial, continual increases in strength in postmenopausal women for at least 12 months, with the greatest gains seen in the first 3 months of training."
