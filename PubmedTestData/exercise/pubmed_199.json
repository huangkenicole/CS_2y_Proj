        "Health-enabling technologies (HET) have high potential in rehabilitation to support patients performing their home exercises. The modeling of human movements as well as the modelling of quality criteria of an exercise performance remains challenging when implementing HETs. A combination of data-driven approaches and knowledge-based methods may deliver new insights. This requires structured quality assessments of concrete exercise performances from a therapists' point of view. Therefore, a structured, easy to use questionnaire to assess home exercise performances is developed and implemented. The questionnaire consists of eight items in three categories: (1-4) overall assessment of quality and quantity, (5-7) need for correction, and (8) correction hints. The collected data will be the basis for mathematical modeling of home exercise performance assessment as foundation for the development of patient supporting HETs."
