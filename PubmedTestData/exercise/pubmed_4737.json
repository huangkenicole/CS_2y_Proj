      "AbstractText": [
        "Physical exercise for patients treated with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has shown positive effects on the quality of life and fatigue in experimental trials. However, there is a need for longitudinal evaluation of exercise programmes implemented in a real-world clinical setting. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of an exercise programme introduced before allo-HSCT on physical activity and fatigue before, during and after in-patient care. A structured exercise programme, including strength and endurance exercises, was implemented at a Swedish university hospital four weeks before transplantation, continuing during in-patient care and after discharge. Between March 2016 and May 2018, 67 adult patients, 33 women and 34 men with a mean age of 55.5 years participated. Fatigue was measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory at four time points. The patients documented their exercises on a checklist each week during the entire study period. The fatigue trajectory differed between various sub-groups, thus individualized supervision and support to maintain motivation is needed. In conclusion, a structured yet realistic exercise programme before admission is beneficial for allo-HSCT patients in order to reduce fatigue and prepare them for transplantation both physically and mentally."
