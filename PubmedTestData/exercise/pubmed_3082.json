        "This study compared resting blood pressure (BP) using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) responses in two groups of subjects trained in land exercise (LE) and aquatic exercise (AE), and assessed post-exercise hypotension (PEH) using ABPM, after land- and aquatic-based exercises.",
        "ABPM (24 hours) was used to measure the baseline BP in elderly hypertensive women trained in LE and AE and the PEH induced by exercise. For this, 40 subjects were evaluated at rest and after a land- or aquatic-based exercise session (aerobic: 75% of reserve heart rate combined with resistance exercise).",
        "The daytime BP was lower for AE [systolic BP (SBP) 124 \u00b1 1.0 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP) 70 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg] than for LE (SBP 134 \u00b1 0.9 mmHg, DBP 76 \u00b1 0.9 mmHg), but there were no differences at night-time. The aquatic exercise-induced PEH in the second hour was maintained at the 24th hour post-exercise. For land exercise-induced PEH, it was maintained at the 12th hour post-exercise. The SBP and DBP were lower at the 24th hour for AE than for LE.",
        "Elderly hypertensive people trained in AE had lower baseline BP during the daytime. SBP and DBP values were lower for individuals trained in AE, and their PEH was more rapid and longer lasting after AE."
