        "Physical activity during pregnancy is known to have a positive effect on both the mother and the fetus/newborn, as long as there are no specific contraindications relating to maternal pathology. Physical activity during pregnancy is known to be associated with reduced incidence of several gestational pathologies, as well as boosting physical and mental capabilities. Furthermore, a positive effect was found in newborns whose mothers continued their physical activity habits throughout pregnancy. Nevertheless, the intensity and duration, and specifically their efforts against resistance, have not been adequately emphasized. Herein, we review the main recent findings and insights on physical activity during pregnancy, and provide a practical set of recommendations."
