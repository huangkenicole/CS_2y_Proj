        "The purpose of this study is to report physical function and quality of life data collected from cancer patients who participated in a supervised exercise intervention at the UW WELL-FIT program over 5\u00a0years.",
        "Five hundred seventy-five participants from 18 to 84\u00a0years of age (mean, 54\u00a0years) were assessed and enrolled in the 24-session program while currently receiving treatment for cancer. Twice weekly, they participated in aerobic exercise, resistance training and stretching exercises for 1\u00a0h each time. Pre- and post-assessments were performed to document changes in physical function, while the short form-36 (SF-36) survey assessed changes in quality of life.",
        "Three hundred eighty-six participants completed the program, while 171 withdrew at some point over the 24 sessions. Pre- and post-cardiovascular assessments were performed on 305 (78.4%) participants. There was a significant increase in the maximum work rate attained and significant decreases in heart rate response, systolic blood pressure and rate of perceived exertion at the submaximal level (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The summary component scales of SF-36 (physical and mental) were significantly improved as well as all eight subscales (p\u2009<\u20090.01).",
        "The data collected from this program indicate that a comprehensive physical activity program involving cardiovascular exercise, resistance training and flexibility can significantly improve physical function and various quality of life indices for individuals undergoing treatment for cancer."
