        "To critically assess the literature focused on strength training of the intrinsic foot muscles (IFMs) and resulting improvements in foot function.",
        "A search of electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus) was completed between January 2000 and March 2022.",
        "Randomized control trials with an outcome of interest and at least 2 weeks of IFM exercise intervention were included. Outcomes of interest were broadly divided into 5 categories of foot posture (navicular drop and Foot Posture Index), namely: balance, strength, patient-reported outcomes, sensory function, and motor performance. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of the included studies with 2 independent reviewers rating each study. Studies with a PEDro score greater than 4/10 were included.",
        "Data extracted by 2 independent reviewers were design, participant characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of intervention, outcomes, and primary results. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to analyze the difference between intervention and control groups for each outcome when at least 2 studies were available. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) describe effect sizes with 95% CIs (SMD ranges). When the CI crossed zero, the effect was not significant.",
        "Thirteen studies were included, and IFM exercise interventions were associated with decreasing navicular drop (SMD range = 0.37, 1.83) and Foot Posture Index (SMD range = 1.03, 1.69) and improving balance (SMD range = 0.18, 1.86), strength (SMD range = 0.06, 1.52), and patient-reported outcomes for disability (SMD range = 0.12, 1.00), with pooled effect sizes favoring the IFM intervention over the control. The IFM exercises were not superior (SMD range = -0.15, 0.66) for reducing pain. We could not perform a meta-analysis for sensory function and motor performance, as only 1 study was available for each outcome; however, these results supported the use of IFM strength training.",
        "Strength training of the IFMs was helpful for patients in improving foot and ankle outcomes."
