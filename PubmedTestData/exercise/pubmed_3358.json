        "Exercises are usually prescribed in association with orthotic intervention for management of idiopathic scoliosis, however the role of these exercises on the efficacy of brace and/or balance is not clear yet.",
        "To investigate the role of exercise (the Blount and Moe protocol) on static balance and Cobb angle changes in adolescents with spinal deformities during weaning from brace.",
        "Seventeen brace users were allocated into 3 groups (good, moderate, and weak), according to their exercise quality and quantity static balance was evaluated on 4 conditions (standing on a platform/foam; with/without brace) using a force platform. Center of pressure displacement parameters were compared among the 3 groups. The mean Cobb angles of scoliosis and kyphosis at the beginning of brace use and at the start of the weaning phase were compared in general and among the 3 analogous groups.",
        "No significant difference was found in the static balance parameters and also in Cobb angles among the 3 groups. However, scoliosis and kyphosis Cobb angles were improved significantly as a result of using the brace (p< 0.01).",
        "The exercise quantity and quality in association with bracing, up to the weaning phase, has no effect on static balance and changes in scoliosis and kyphosis, but the curvature of scoliosis and kyphosis is reduced after wearing a brace."
