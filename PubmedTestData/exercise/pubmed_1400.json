        "The purpose was to explore operable lung cancer patient experiences with an exercise intervention from a longitudinal perspective according to patient motivation and patient perceived benefits and barriers of exercise.",
        "Nineteen patients enrolled in an exercise intervention 2 weeks post-surgery participated in qualitative interviews at three time points. A criteria sampling strategy was applied. Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutical philosophy inspired the analysis.",
        "Patients initiated exercising median 15 days postoperative. Eight patients included in the interview study dropped out of the intervention due to side effects of chemotherapy (n = 3) and external circumstances (n = 5). The mean attendance rate for the eleven participants who completed the intervention was 82 %. No patients experienced severe adverse events. Motivation for participation included patients' expectations of physical benefits and the security of having professionals present. Patients experienced physical and emotional benefits and affirmed their social identity. Barriers were primarily related to side effects of chemotherapy.",
        "The exercise intervention was undertaken safely by operable lung cancer patients initiated 2 weeks after surgery. The intervention put the patients on track to a healthier lifestyle regarding physical activity and smoking. The study indicates that exercise initiated early in the treatment trajectory is beneficial for operable lung cancer patients and especially for those who were physically active and motivated pre-illness and who did not experience side effect of treatment."
