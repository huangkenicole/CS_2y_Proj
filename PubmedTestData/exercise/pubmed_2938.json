      "AbstractText": [
        "Knee extension exercise is useful and practical for obese and overweight people as this form of exercise is effective in minimizing body weight loading on joints and improving the body's physiological function. This study aimed to compare the physiological and psychophysical parameters of office workers while computer-based working in an active workstation equipped with an active footrest (AFR) prototype with a mechanism for performing knee extension exercises in a sitting position, and also to compare the physiological and psychophysical parameters among normal-weight and obese office workers.",
        "In this quasi-experimental study, the physiological parameters of heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) (measured with the Fitbit Charge HR smartwatch) were measured in two cross-over random sessions for 32 office workers (16 normal-weight and 16 obese) aged 28 to 50 years (<i>M</i> = 42.72, standard deviation [<i>SD</i>] = 4.37) while performing office tasks in sitting and active workstations (equipped with AFR). Perceived physical exertion, comfort, fatigue, and liking were also measured by rating the participants.",
        "Short-term activity of the participants with AFR performing computer tasks significantly improved physiological and psychophysical parameters compared with the participants in sitting workstations. However, there was no significant difference in the effect of AFR on physiological and psychophysical parameters between normal-weight and obese participants.",
        "Given the significant increase in EE and HR resulting from exercise with AFR compared with the conventional workstation, the use of AFR can help office workers achieve the minimum standard of physical activity at their workplace."
