        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of active non-weight-bearing (NWB) group exercising on women with non specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP).",
        "Forty females with NSCLBP were assigned in a randomized control longitudinal single blinded pilot study. 20 of them were assigned to a NWB bi-weekly group exercise class and 20 females were included in the control group. The exercises involved the entire lumbo-pelvic spine aimed at improving lumbar mobility/flexibility and stability. Pain intensity (VAS), back specific disability (Rolland Morris questionnaire-RMQ), and lumbar flexion and extension ranges of motion measurements were taken prior to intervention (t(0)), immediately following 4 weeks of intervention (t(1)) and 8 weeks later (t(fu)). Reliability trials were conducted on 10 females. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical significance (p < 0.05).",
        "The following significant changes in outcome measures were indicated at t(1) compared with t(0) and control group (p < 0.001): an increase in lumbar flexion and extension (mean difference = 9.26\u25e6 (+54%) for flexion and 5.95\u25e6 for extension(+98%)); reduction in VAS score (mean difference = 2.32 (+58%)) and RMQ score (mean difference = 4.9 (\u221234%)). All changes remained significant at t(fu). At t(0), lumbar flexion was correlated with extension (r = 0.547) and VAS (r = \u22120.581),whereas the RMQ score correlated with VAS score (r = 0.599) and negatively with lumbar extension (r = \u22120.665). At t(1),lumbar flexion correlated with extension (r = 0.664) and negatively with RMQ score (r = \u22120.54). At t(fu), changes in VAS score were negatively correlated with changes in lumbar flexion (r = \u22120.522), while changes in lumbar flexion correlated with extension (r = 0.58).",
