        "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of a 3-month, trampoline-based stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) exercises on muscle strength and postural control in children with Down's syndrome (DS).",
        "Thirty-two children with DS aged between 7-9 years were enrolled and randomly assigned into the control group (n = 16); received standard physical therapy (sPT) or SSC group (n = 16); received sPT in addition to a 15-minute, trampoline-based SSC training program twice per week for 12 successive weeks. Lower limb muscle strength and postural stability [anterior/posterior stability index (A/P-SI), medial/lateral stability index (M/L-SI)], and overall stability index (O-SI) were assessed pre- and post-treatment.",
        "Strength of hip extensor (p=0.034) and adductor (p=0.015), knee extensor (p=0.028) and flexor (p=0.01), and ankle dorsi (p=0.033) and plantar flexor (p=0.007) muscles increased significantly in the SSC group when compared with the control group. Also, the A/P-SI (p=0.019), M/L-SI (p=0.002), and O-SI (p=0.021) decreased significantly in the SSC group when compared with the control group, suggesting better postural control.",
        "Twelve weeks of trampoline-based SSC exercises are likely effective for enhancing muscle strength and postural control in children with DS and should consequently be included in the rehabilitation programs for these children."
