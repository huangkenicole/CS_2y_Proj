        "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different exercise combinations on cognitive status, muscle strength of lower extremities, mobility, physical performance, mood and quality of life in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",
        "A total of 48 older adults with MCI were randomly assigned to four groups: (1) aerobic plus lower extremity strengthening exercises (AG), (2) dual-task training plus lower extremity strengthening exercises (DG), (3) aerobic exercise, dual-task training and lower extremity strengthening exercises (ADG), (4) solely lower extremity strengthening exercises (CG). Patients' cognitive status, lower extremity muscle strength, balance, mobility, activities-specific balance confidence, functional exercise capacity, physical performance, mood and quality of life were evaluated.",
        "In all three intervention groups, there was a significant improvement in cognitive status, balance, mobility, activities-specific balance confidence, physical performance, mood and quality of life (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The most remarkable change was observed in the ADG on cognitive status, mobility and physical performance parameters (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, the most significant improvement in balance parameters was recorded both in the DG and ADG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Besides, the highest increase in functional exercise capacity was detected both in the AG and ADG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). On the other hand, both exercise combinations were superior to the control group in terms of improving mood and quality of life (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "The trial results proved that aerobic exercise and dual-task training is the best combination for improving cognitive status, mobility and physical performance in older adults with MCI."
