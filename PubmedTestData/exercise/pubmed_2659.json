        "Physical activity contributes to body weight regulation. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity may be needed. When not coupled with dietary restriction, physical activity contributes to an average weight loss of approximately 2 to 3 kg in interventions up to 6 months in duration; when added to modest dietary restriction it adds 20% additional weight loss compared with modest dietary restriction alone. Physical activity is associated with enhanced long-term weight loss and attenuation of weight regain and should be included within clinical and public health approaches to prevent weight regain and to treat obesity."
