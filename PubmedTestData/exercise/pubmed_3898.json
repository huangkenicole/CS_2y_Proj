        "A high percentage of patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) do not adequately adhere to home exercise programs. There is no information regarding a possible association between patient independence in performing an exercise program and adherence to this exercise program.",
        "To assess a possible association between patient independence in performing two different home exercise programs (treatment based on the Movement System Impairment-Based classification model (MSI) and treatment based on stretching and strengthening exercises for chronic LBP and adherence to those exercise programs.",
        "This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.",
        "The physical therapist assessed the patient's independence in performing the exercise program at the initial physical therapy sessions. Adherence was calculated during the 8-week treatment by the number of days performing the home exercise programs. Multivariate linear regression models were built to investigate whether patient independence in performing the home exercise program was associated with adherence to home exercise program for each treatment group adjusted for possible confounders (age, physical activity status, pain duration, pain intensity and disability at baseline).",
        "We observed a clinically important association between patient independence in performing the home exercise and adherence to a treatment based on the MSI model group (\u00df\u202f=\u202f-15.6 days, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f-24.5 to\u00a0-6.7, R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f16%, p\u202f=\u202f0.001).",
        "People with chronic LBP adhered more to a home exercise program based on the MSI model when they are more independent in performing the exercise program."
