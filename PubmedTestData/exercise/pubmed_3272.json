        "This study compares the influence of different exercise training programs on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fat oxidation, in basal conditions (BFox) and during exercise (MFO), in sedentary, middle-aged adults.",
        "The study subjects of this 12 week-long, randomised controlled trial, were 71 middle-aged adults (age 53.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 years; 52% women). Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: (1) no exercise, (2) concurrent training based on international physical activity recommendations (PAR group), (3) high intensity interval training (HIIT group), and (4) high intensity interval training plus whole-body electromyostimulation (HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0EMS group). Subject BMR, BFox and MFO were determined by indirect calorimetry before and after the intervention.",
        "The HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0EMS subjects showed significant increases in BFox following the intervention compared with the control group (all P\u00a0=\u00a00.043); no such differences were seen in the PAR and HIIT compared with the control group (all P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.1). A significant increase in post-intervention MFO was noted for the HIIT and HIIT\u00a0+\u00a0EMS group compared to the non-exercise control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); no such difference was seen in the PAR group compared to the control group (all P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.05).",
        "Twelve weeks of high intensity interval training plus whole-body electromyostimulation may increase the BFox and MFO of middle-aged sedentary adults. These findings have important clinical implications; a well-designed high-intensity interval training program plus whole-body electromyostimulation might be followed to help combat the appearance of chronic metabolic diseases characterized by metabolic inflexibility in middle-aged sedentary adults, though it will be necessary to determine how long the effects last."
