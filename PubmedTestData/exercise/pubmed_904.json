        "<b>Purpose:</b> The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different exercise interventions on quality of life parameters in breast cancer patients during 1 year of outpatient rehabilitation. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A total of 115 breast cancer patients met the eligibility criteria and completed the study. Participants were randomly allocated for the water exercise interventions (group A, n <i>=</i> 45), for the Pilates exercise interventions (group B, n <i>=</i> 40), and yoga exercise interventions (group C, n <i>=</i> 30). The 3 groups attended relevant programs for 1 year and received 144 rehabilitation sessions. Quality of life parameters were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaire with a specific module for breast cancer patients (FACT-B). Quality of life data were recorded at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of exercise interventions. <b>Results:</b> A significant increase in quality of life indicators was observed in participants of all groups. Based on the results of the 12-month monitoring, patients of group A scored significantly more points for emotional well-being compared with group B and group C by 1.40 points (<i>P</i> < .05) and 1.69 points (<i>P</i> < .01), respectively, as well as by breast cancer subscale by 2.15 points (<i>P</i> < .05) compared with group B. Patients in group C scored significantly better compared with group A in social/family well-being by 2.80 points (<i>P</i> < .01). <b>Conclusions:</b> It was found that using water exercise intervention is more effective for improving emotional well-being and decreasing negative symptoms associated with breast cancer treatment compared with Pilates and yoga interventions, while yoga was more effective in improving social/family well-being. Further research on water interventions for different populations is warranted."
