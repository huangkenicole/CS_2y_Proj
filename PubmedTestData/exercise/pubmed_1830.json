        "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders, and thus effective treatments are required. Recently, real horseback riding has been reported to be beneficial for the patients. However, it has some limitations, such as limited approaches and safety issues.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of horse simulator riding on back pain, body composition and trunk strength in the patients with CLBP.",
        "Forty-seven men with CLBP (mean age 20.55 \u00b1 1.38 years) were randomly divided into a control group (n = 23) and a horse simulator riding group (n = 24), and visual analogue scale (VAS), body composition and isokinetic trunk strength were measured after 8 weeks for which subjects in a horse simulator riding group had performed the horse simulator exercise (HSE).",
        "Horse simulator exercise significantly reduced pain scores of VAS and enhanced isokinetic torques of trunk at 30 and 90\u00b0/s. There were also significantly increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass in horse simulator riding group.",
        "It can be inferred that HSE may be helpful in relief of back pain and recovery of back function through developing trunk strength and balancing the ratio of trunk flexor/extensor muscles."
