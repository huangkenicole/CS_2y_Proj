      "AbstractText": [
        "Although a knee valgus position is related to the increase in injury risk in volleyball players, there is a lack of studies on the relationship between knee valgus and vertical jump (VJ) performance. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a postural exercise program on VJ height in young female volleyball players with knee valgus.",
        "This pilot study included 19 young female volleyball players divided into the following groups: the Valgus Experimental Group (VEG); the Valgus Control Group (VCG); and the Neutral Control Group (NCG). All three groups carried out the same volleyball training program. In addition, only the VEG underwent a 3-month postural exercise program of 30-45 min/session, twice/week. VJ performance was measured through the Sargent test before (T0), at 6 weeks (T1), and at 12 weeks (T2).",
        "A significant effect from T0 to T1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0017) and from T0 to T2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0001) was found in the VEG. No significant differences were found over time in the VCG and in the NCG.",
        "An integrated postural exercise program might lead to a more balanced muscle efficiency inducing athletes to obtain a higher VJ performance."
