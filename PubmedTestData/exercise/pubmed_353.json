        "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients. Physical activity after transplant is the most modifiable nonpharmacological factor for improving cardiovascular outcomes. Few studies have tested walking interventions to enhance daily steps and health outcomes in older kidney recipients.",
        "Using a pilot feasibility randomized clinical trial design, we tested the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-month SystemCHANGE\u2122 (Change Habits by Applying New Goals and Experience) + Activity Tracker intervention for recruitment, retention, daily steps, and health outcomes (blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, waist circumference, and physical function). The SystemCHANGE\u2122 + Activity Tracker intervention taught participants to use a multicomponent intervention that connects person-centered systems solutions combined with visual feedback from a mobile activity tracker to achieve daily step goals.",
        "Fifty-three participants (mean age 65 years, 66% male, and 57% white) participated with 27 in the intervention and 26 in the control group. The study protocol was feasible to deliver with high adherence to the protocol in both groups. The intervention group increased daily steps at 3 months (mean difference, 608; standard error = 283, <i>P</i> = .03) compared to the control group. The secondary outcome of heart rate decreased for the intervention group (baseline [mean] 74.4+ 10.8 [standard deviation, SD;] vs 6 months [mean] 67.6+ 11.3 [SD]; <i>P</i> = .002) compared to the control group (baseline [mean] 70.67+ 10.4 [SD]; vs 6 months [mean] 70.2 + 11.1 [SD]; <i>P</i> = .83).",
