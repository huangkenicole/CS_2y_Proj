        "To explore the efficacy of Chinese fitness exercise Yi Jin Jing exercise in intervening the cervical spondylopathy in adolescents.",

        "The study was conducted in 60 adolescent patients with cervical spondylopathy, with 30 patients in each group. The observation group was required to take Yi Jin Jing exercise, and the control group took the brisk walking exercise. The first week was the preparatory period for the patients, and then the participants were required to do exercises three times a week for at least 30 minutes in the later 3 weeks. Before and after treatment, Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores, pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and cervical curvature in both groups were observed, and the incidence of adverse events in both groups was recorded during the trial.",
        "The NDI and VAS scores in both groups statistically decreased after intervention and mildly increased at follow-up, while the reduction in scores of the Yi Jin Jing group was more significant. Cervical curvature in both groups improved on day 28 compared to day 0. There were no adverse reactions during the evaluation period.",
