      "AbstractText": [
        "To date, studies examining the effect of exercise on neurotrophic factors in MS are contradictory, and this may be explained, in part, by moderators such as disability status. To investigating the effect of a 12-week (3sessions/week) supervised multimodal exercise program on neurotrophic factors levels.",
        "Ninety four women with MS were randomly assigned into exercise or control conditions with randomization stratified by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of low (EDSS< 4.5), moderate (4.5 \u2264EDSS\u2264 6), or high (EDSS\u2265 6.5) disability. The exercise program comprised resistance, endurance, Pilates, balance and stretch exercises. Resting level of neurotrophic factors, aerobic capacity, one-repetition maximum, and physiological cost index (PCI) were evaluated before and after the intervention period.",
        "Exercise training improved brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-4/5 levels. The effect of exercise on NT-3 was dependent on disability status such that exercise groups with low and high disability had more pronounced changes compared with other condition. There were no exercise effects on ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Aerobic capacity and one-repetition maximum, but not PCI, were improved with exercise independent of disability status.",
        "Exercise can stimulate neurotrophic production and secretion, and this is generally not influenced by disability status. Exercise training may be an adjuvant for disease-modifying therapy among people with MS, and its effect may not be moderated by disability status."
