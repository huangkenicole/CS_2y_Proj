      "AbstractText": [
        "Besides pharmacological treatment regular physical activity is one of the cornerstones of care in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, recent research has shown insufficient levels of physical activity in the RA population. This is of concern given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There is moderate quality evidence supporting that short-term land-based aerobic exercise on moderate to high intensity results in positive effects on oxygen uptake and pain, but not muscular strength; short-term water-based aerobic exercise on moderate to high intensity results in a positive effect on oxygen uptake; short-term land-based aerobic and strengthening exercise on moderate to high intensity results in positive effects on oxygen uptake and muscular strength, but not pain, and long-term land-based aerobic and strengthening exercise on moderate to high intensity results in positive effects on activity limitation, oxygen uptake and muscular strength."
