        "Exercise has shown to reduce asthma symptoms; however, the underlying mechanism for this improvement remains unclear. Improvement in inflammatory control could be the reason for this reduction in symptoms. This review discusses recent studies evaluating the effect of exercise on inflammatory control in patients with asthma.",
        "New studies support that exercise is well tolerated and feasible regardless of intensity. Exercise seems to improve systemic low-grade inflammation, but consistency lacks when it comes to reduction in airway inflammation.",
        "Physical exercise as an adjuvant therapy leads to improvement in asthma symptoms and asthma-related quality of life and should be recommended for all patients with asthma."
