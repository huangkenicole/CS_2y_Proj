        "This is a review of studies that investigate the efficacy of exercise therapy and physical activity for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis since the 2008 Cochrane Review.",
        "Studies were identified that investigated the use of physical activity and exercise therapy in the treatment of children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, excluding the Cochrane Review. Two reviewers individually analyzed the results of the search to determine the eligibility of studies. The randomized controlled trial study designs were evaluated using PEDro scales.",
        "Recent literature supports the importance of the combination of strengthening, stretching, proprioceptive, and balance exercises and activities in water. Many of the reviewed studies proposed an intensive program of physical activity and exercise therapy, conducted 3 times a week for 12 weeks."
