        "<i>Background:</i> Scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of physical activity (PA) in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases is increasing. Healthcare systems are trying to increase exercise prescription treatments. However, it is not clear if health professionals are sufficiently trained. <i>Aim:</i> to analyze the contents related to PA and exercise in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases in the syllabus of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing at all Spanish universities. <i>Methods:</i> A systematic environmental scan that included a web page search of curricular guide programs of all Spanish universities offering the Bachelor of Science in Nursing was undertaken for the 2017-2018 academic course. The assessment of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) about physical activity and/or exercise health-related benefits in the prevention or treatment of chronic diseases was performed by two experts in a peer-review process. ECTS of Practicum and Bachelor thesis were not included in the analysis. <i>Results:</i> In the mean, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing dedicated 5.82% (5.01% mandatory and 0.82% voluntary) of a total of 240 ECTS (ranging from 0 to 45 ECTS). The majority of contents were related to PA promotion; in contrast, contents related to exercise prescription are neglectable. Five Spanish universities do not offer any academic teaching to physical activity on prescription. <i>Conclusions:</i> A great disparity between universities was identified. In general, acquired knowledge seems scarce for PA promotion and exercise prescription in primary healthcare staff. Nurses would need additional physical activity on prescription training to improve PA promotion and exercise prescription knowledge as a coadjutant non-pharmacological treatment for non-communicable chronic diseases in Primary Healthcare settings."
