        "Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience gains in fitness, physical and mental health from regular participation in exercise and physical activity. Due to changes in physiological function of the cardiovascular, nervous, and muscular systems, general population physical activity guidelines and traditional exercise prescription methods are not appropriate for the SCI population. Exercise guidelines specific to persons with SCI recommend progressive training beginning at 20\u00a0min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise twice per week transitioning to 30\u00a0min three times per week, with strength training of the major muscle groups two times per week. These population-specific guidelines were designed considering the substantial barriers to physical activity for persons with SCI and can be used to frame an individual exercise prescription. Rating of perceived exertion (i.e., perceptually regulated exercise) is a practical way to indicate moderate to vigorous intensity exercise in community settings. Adapted exercise modes include arm cycle ergometry, hybrid arm-leg cycling, and recumbent elliptical equipment. Body weight-supported treadmill training and other rehabilitation modalities may improve some aspects of health and fitness for people with SCI if completed at sufficient intensity. Disability-specific community programs offer beneficial opportunities for persons with SCI to experience quality exercise opportunities but are not universally available."
