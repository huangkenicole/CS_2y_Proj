        "Exercise training have numerous beneficial effects on the complications of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Exercise training may cause immediate effects on balance control in DPN patients. This study aims to assess the Acute Short Term effects of endurance and resistance exercise training on balance control in DPN patients.",
        "In this study, 11 patients with DPN and 11 healthy subjects participated. Patients and healthy subjects did endurance and resistance training in two separate exercise sessions. Dynamic balance and functional balance test were assessed before and after the interventions. Independent t-test was used to compare balance indices before and after training, the intervention effects were examined using ANOVA repeated measure test. The statistical significance level was set at <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05.",
        "The results showed that dynamic and functional balance in DPN patients were significantly lower than in healthy subjects. Anterior-posterior stability and total stability indices and functional balance test deteriorated significantly after training.",
        "Endurance or resistance training may lead to acute disturbance of dynamic and functional balance in DPN patients. Hence, immediately after exercise, patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of falling, therefore, preventive considerations are necessary."
