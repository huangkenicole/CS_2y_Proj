      "AbstractText": [
        "New or worsening frailty is a common problem in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during the prolonged time awaiting kidney transplantation. Structured physical activity in the dialysis setting has been shown to mitigate frailty, but little is known about the benefits of home-based exercise. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the effects of home-based exercise interventions on indicators of frailty (weakness, slowness, low physical activity, perceived exhaustion, and shrinking) among patients diagnosed with ESRD.",
        "We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar using Medical Subject Heading terms and free text keywords including kidney failure, exercise, and frailty. We identified 13 relevant articles (eight randomized controlled trials, five quasi-experimental studies).",
        "Our review found potential effectiveness of home-based exercise interventions on mitigating or preventing selected indicators of frailty (e.g., weakness, slowness, low physical activity, perceived exhaustion), particularly when the interventions combined aerobic walking, resistance exercise, and behavioral components and were delivered for at least 6 months. However, no published studies measured the effect of home-based exercise interventions on frailty as a whole.",
        "While existing studies suggest likely benefits of home-based exercise interventions among patients with ESRD, future research is warranted to develop and test home-based physical activity interventions that address all indicators of frailty."
