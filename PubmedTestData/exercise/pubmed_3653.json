        "It is necessary to improve the health of older adults through exercise, but there is no concrete way to implement it or an environment in which they can exercise continuously. Our objective was to confirm the safety and efficacy of information technology (IT) convergence gamification exercise equipment for older adults. We tried to demonstrate equivalence to conventional exercise by comparing the functional improvement.",
        "Randomized controlled trial, with 8-week-long IT convergence exercises 3 times a week vs conventional exercise.",
        "40 community-dwelling participants aged 60-85\u00a0years.",
        "Participants were randomly divided into a conventional exercise group (group 1) and an IT convergence exercise group (group 2). Both groups were trained for 8\u00a0weeks, and functional assessment was performed before training (pre-evaluation), after training, and after 4\u00a0weeks of rest.",
        "There were functional improvements in both groups. A comparison of the differences in the functional assessment between pre-evaluation and after 8\u00a0weeks of training yielded the following results. In group 1, the mean Five Times Sit to Stand Test-30\u00a0seconds was scored as 3.60 \u00b1 2.56 (P < .015); Five Times Sit to Stand Test-5 times,\u00a0-1.75 \u00b1 2.04 s (P < .015); Berg Balance Scale, 1.05 \u00b1 1.39 (P < .015); Timed Up-and-Go test,\u00a0-0.64 \u00b1 0.64 s (P < .015); and 10-m Walking Test,\u00a0-0.35 \u00b1 0.47 s (P < .015). And in group 2, the mean Five Times Sit to Stand Test-30\u00a0seconds (s) was scored as 3.70 \u00b1 2.62 (P < .015), Five Times Sit to Stand Test-5 times,\u00a0-1.65 \u00b1 1.59 s (P < .015); Berg Balance Scale, 1.05 \u00b1 1.00 (P < .015); Timed Up-and-Go test,\u00a0-0.93 \u00b1 0.68 s (P < .015); 10-m Walking Test,\u00a0-0.41 \u00b1 0.489 s (P < .015); Chair Sit and Reach test, 2.23 \u00b1 3.19 cm (P < .015); and Korean version of the Falls Efficacy Scale-International,\u00a0-1.05 \u00b1 1.43 (P < .015).",
        "The results of this study suggest that the IT convergence gamification exercise equipment such as balpro110 has exercise effects similar to conventional exercise and also has advantages as an alternative to exercise for older adults in the next generation."
