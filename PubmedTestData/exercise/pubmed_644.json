        "The lumbar-type Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is expected to expand the possibilities of exercise therapy for severe cardiac patients who have difficulty in moving on their own legs. We investigated whether motion assistance from HAL during squat exercise could effectively reduce the cardiopulmonary burden in healthy subjects. Twelve healthy subjects (33\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fyears) performed squat exercise for 3 consecutive minutes at a repetition rate of 20 squats per minute with and without assistance from a lumbar-type HAL. The oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), and the Borg Scale were monitored during exercise. VO2 (930\u202f\u00b1\u202f207 vs 992\u202f\u00b1\u202f169\u202fmL/min, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and the Borg Scale rating (12.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.1 vs 13.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) at the end of exercise were significantly lower when HAL was used. When 2 subjects who regularly perform high-intensity exercise for more than 10\u202fh per week were excluded from the analyses, VO2, VCO2, VE, and the Borg Scale were significantly lower when HAL was used. Our results demonstrate that the lumbar-type HAL significantly reduces cardiopulmonary burden during squat exercise in healthy subjects. The effects were especially striking in sedentary subjects. Further studies on cardiac patients are expected to establish a new cardiac rehabilitation program using HAL."
