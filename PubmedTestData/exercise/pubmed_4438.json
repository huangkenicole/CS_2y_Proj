        "This study aimed at examining the concurrent validity and reliability of the multi-point method and the two-point method's variations for estimating the one-repetition maximum (1RM) in the deadlift and squat exercises and to determine the accuracy of which optimal two loads can be used for the two-point method protocol. Thirteen resistance-trained men performed six sessions that consisted of two incremental loading tests (multi-point method: 20-40-60-80-90% and two-point method variations: 40-60%, 40-80%, 40-90%,60-80%, 60-90%) followed by 1RM tests. Both the multi-point method and the two-point method load variations showed reliable results for 1RM estimation (CV < 10%) squat and deadlift exercises. Session-session reliability was found to be low in deadlift (ICC: 0.171-0.335) and squat exercises (ICC: 0.235-0.479) of 40-60% and 60-80% in two-point methods. Deadlift (ICC: 0.815-0.996) and squat (ICC: 0.817-0.988) had high session-to-session reliability in all other methods. Regarding the validity of deadlift exercise, the multipoint method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.864) and two variations of the two-point method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.816 for 40-80%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.732 for 60-80%) showed very large correlations, whereas other two variations of the two-point method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.945 for 40-90%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.914 for 60-90%) showed almost perfect correlations with the actual 1RM. Regarding the validity of squat exercise, the multi-point method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.773) and two variations of the two-point method (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0847 for 60-80%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.705 for 40-90%) showed very large correlations, whereas 40-60% variation showed almost perfect correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.962) with the actual 1RM. In conclusion, whereas both the multi-point method and the two-point method load variations showed reliable results, the multiple-point method and most of the two-point methods' load variations examined in this research provided an accurate (from large-moderate to perfect) estimate of the 1RM. Therefore, we recommend using the multi-point method and especially the two-point methods variations including higher relative loads to estimate 1RM."
