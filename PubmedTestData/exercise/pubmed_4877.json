        "Plyometric and resistance exercises are known to cause exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Thus, this study examined the impact of EIMD on various field-specific performance measures following a training session that combined plyometric and resistance exercises.",
        "Nine competitive Ultimate Frisbee players undertook a training session consisting of several modes of plyometric and resistance exercises. Indirect markers of muscle damage (i.e., creatine kinase [CK] and delayed onset of muscle soreness [DOMS]) and field-specific performance measures (i.e., run-up vertical jump, standing broad jump, linear sprint and repeated agility) were measured prior to, 24 hours (T24) and 48 hours (T48) post training.",
        "The combined plyometric and resistance training session significantly increased muscle damage markers at T24 (CK: 326.5\u00b1210.4% and DOMS: 343.3\u00b1181.6%) and T48 (CK: 969.2\u00b11262.3% and DOMS: 371.1\u00b1179.3%). The jump performance measures were significantly reduced at T24 (run-up vertical jump -5.5\u00b16.3% and standing broad jump -4.7\u00b13.7%) and T48 (run-up vertical jump -4.2\u00b15.1% and standing broad jump -5.0\u00b14.4%). Furthermore, completion times for linear sprint performance was significantly increased at T24 (4.5\u00b13.4%) and T48 (7.2\u00b14.2%), whilst the average completion time for the repeated agility protocol was significantly increased at T24 (1.4\u00b11.4%).",
        "Competitive team sport athletes may require at least 48 hours of recovery when implementing field-based conditioning sessions after a training session that combines plyometrics and resistance exercises, particular if unfamiliar with such training modalities."
