        "Patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at risk of developing secondary sarcopenia. Both pharmacological and exercise interventions are essential for treatment. However, for such patients, exercise loads may lead to the progression of joint destruction and worsening of pain. The purpose of this report was to assess the feasibility of a home-based, low-intensity resistance exercise programme. The case was a 70-year-old female patient with sarcopenia secondary to RA. She was diagnosed with RA at 57\u2009years of age and began medication, maintaining remission of disease activity. However, she did not exercise habitually and was relatively inactive in her daily life. Furthermore, she had kinesiophobia associated with her RA-related symptoms. We suggested implementing a home-based low-intensity resistance exercise programme >3\u2009months, with the goal of exercising the lower extremities daily. The patient was asked to self-monitor using an exercise diary and attend monthly outpatient visits for repeat counselling and feedback. As a result, she was able to perform the exercise programme safely with high compliance, improving her kinesiophobia as well as physical inactivity, although her skeletal muscle mass did not change. Regular exercise and increased physical activity may help prevent the onset of sarcopenia. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing our exercise programme and support its potential for preventing the progression of sarcopenia. While questions remain in terms of treating sarcopenia, we believe that our findings will lead to the establishment of an exercise programme for patients with sarcopenia secondary to established rheumatoid arthritis."
