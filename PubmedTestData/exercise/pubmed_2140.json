        "Barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) (e.g., finances, mobility, and lack of awareness about the benefits of PR). Reducing these barriers by providing COPD patients with convenient access to PR educational and exercise training may help improve the adoption of PR. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology that may provide an interactive and engaging method of supporting a home-based PR program. The goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the feasibility of a VR app for a home-based PR education and exercise program using a mixed-methods design. 18 COPD patients were asked to complete three brief tasks using a VR-based PR application. Afterward, patients completed a series of quantitative and qualitative assessments to evaluate the usability, acceptance, and overall perspectives and experience of using a VR system to engage with PR education and exercise training. The findings from this study demonstrate the high acceptability and usability of the VR system to promote participation in a PR program. Patients were able to successfully operate the VR system with minimal assistance. This study examines patient perspectives thoroughly while leveraging VR-based technology to facilitate access to PR. The future development and deployment of a patient-centered VR-based system in the future will consider patient insights and ideas to promote PR in COPD patients."
