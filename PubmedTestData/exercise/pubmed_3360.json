      "AbstractText": [
        "A low-cost isokinetic knee exerciser, known as the VariCom and developed with the emphasis on fulfilling the rehabilitation needs of developing countries, was subjected to a clinical evaluation. The evaluation was motivated by successful laboratory assessment of the exerciser as well as encouraging qualitative data acquired recently from a developing world hospital. The principal aim of this study was to demonstrate that the exerciser, employing a simple shock-absorber and lever mechanism, was capable of fulfilling the major criteria required from isokinetic equipment. Amongst the most important of these were attainment of a 'spectrum of velocities', patient safety, reliability, ease-of-use, patient comfort and estimation of the torque generated by the patient's knee-joint. It was ultimately demonstrated that the combination of design simplicity, durability and functionality renders the VariCom knee-exerciser technologically appropriate for use in developing countries. More generally, the success of the exerciser, combined with its low manufacturing cost, renders it a viable alternative to traditional up-market equipment."
