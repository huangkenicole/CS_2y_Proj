        "This study assessed the effects of 12-week supervised resistance training combined with home-based physical activity on physical fitness, cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and life satisfaction in female breast cancer survivors.",
        "A parallel-group, outcome assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial included 60 female breast cancer survivors who had completed their core treatments within the previous 10\u00a0years. Through computer-generated simple randomization, participants were assigned to resistance training (RTG; two sessions/week for 12\u00a0weeks plus instructions to undertake\u2009\u2265\u200910,000 steps/d) or control (CG;\u2009\u2265\u200910,000 steps/d only). Outcomes were evaluated at baseline and week 12. Muscular strength was assessed with electromechanical dynamometry. A standardized full-body muscular strength score was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness, shoulder mobility, cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, HRQoL, and life satisfaction.",
        "Thirty-two participants were assigned to RTG (29 achieved\u2009\u2265\u200975% attendance) and 28 to CG (all completed the trial). Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the standardized full-body muscular strength score increased significantly in the RTG compared to the CG (0.718; 95% CI 0.361-1.074, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen's\u00a0d = 1.04). This increase was consistent for the standardized scores of upper-body (0.727; 95% CI 0.294-1.160, P\u2009=\u20090.001, d = 0.87) and lower-body (0.709; 95% CI 0.324-1.094, P\u2009=\u20090.001, d = 0.96) strength. There was no effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, shoulder flexion, cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, HRQoL, or life satisfaction. The sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.",
        "and implication for cancer survivors. In female breast cancer survivors who had completed their core treatments within the past 10\u00a0years, adding two weekly sessions of supervised resistance training\u00a0to a prescription of\u00a0home-based physical activity\u00a0for 12\u00a0weeks produced a large increase in upper-, lower-, and full-body muscular strength, while other fitness components and patient-reported outcomes did not improve.",
