        "Poor cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a cardinal feature of post-treatment primary lung cancer. The most effective exercise therapy regimen to improve CRF has not been determined.",
        "In this parallel-group factorial randomized controlled trial, lung cancer survivors with poor CRF (below age-sex sedentary values) were randomly allocated to receive 48 consecutive supervised sessions thrice weekly of (i) aerobic training (AT)-cycle ergometry at 55% to >95% of peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> peak); (ii) resistance training (RT)-lower and upper extremity exercises at 50-85% of maximal strength; (iii) combination training (CT)-AT plus RT; or (iv) stretching attention control (AC) for 16\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was change in CRF (VO<sub>2</sub> peak, mL\u00a0O<sub>2</sub> \u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> ). Secondary endpoints were body composition, muscle strength, patient-reported outcomes, tolerability (relative dose intensity of exercise), and safety. Analysis of covariance determined change in primary and secondary endpoints from baseline to post-intervention (Week 17) with adjustment for baseline values of the endpoint and other relevant clinical covariates.",
        "Ninety patients (65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0years; 66% female) were randomized (AT, n\u00a0=\u00a024; RT, n\u00a0=\u00a023; CT, n\u00a0=\u00a020; and AC, n\u00a0=\u00a023) of the planned n\u00a0=\u00a0160. No serious adverse events were observed. For the overall cohort, the lost-to-follow-up rate was 10%. Mean attendance was \u226575% in all groups. In intention-to-treat analysis, VO<sub>2</sub> peak increased 1.1\u00a0mL\u00a0O<sub>2</sub> \u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 2.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04] and 1.4\u00a0mL\u00a0O<sub>2</sub> \u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI: 0.2, 2.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) in AT and CT, respectively, compared with AC. There was no difference in VO<sub>2</sub> peak change between RT and AC (-0.1\u00a0mL\u00a0O<sub>2</sub> \u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> , 95% CI: -1.2, 1.0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.88). Favourable improvements in maximal strength and body composition were observed in RT and CT groups compared with AT and AC groups (Ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No between-group changes were observed for any patient-reported outcomes. Relative dose intensity of exercise was lower in RT and CT compared with AT (Ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05).",
        "In the context of a smaller than planned sample size, AT and CT significantly improved VO<sub>2</sub> peak in lung cancer survivors; however, the tolerability-to-benefit ratio was superior for AT and hence may be the preferred modality to target impaired CRF in post-treatment lung cancer survivors."
