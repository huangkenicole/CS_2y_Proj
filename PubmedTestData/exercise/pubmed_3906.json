        "This review summarizes recent evidence-based integrative therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) that may improve motor and non-motor symptoms, enhance quality of life, and alter disease progression.",
        "Imaging studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise changes brain structure and function, while strength training improves posture and balance. Loneliness is associated with worsening PD severity, but social prescribing and cognitive behavioral therapy may effectively foster connections. Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine practices including yoga, meditation, tai chi, and acupuncture may help improve mobility, mood, sleep, and quality of life. Art therapy enhances visuospatial skills, whereas music and dance therapy can alleviate freezing of gait. Several studies demonstrate successful use of these integrative strategies virtually, thereby improving patient accessibility and participation. PD management has broadened to include integrative approaches combining conventional and complementary therapies. Potential benefits of movement, nutrition, sleep, socialization, and mind-body practices have been confirmed with several recent randomized controlled trials."
