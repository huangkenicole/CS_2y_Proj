        "We sought to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise with that of treatment with antidepressant drugs routinely used in clinical practice, in terms of decreasing depressive symptomatology in patients aged \u226565 years who present with clinical criteria of a depressive episode.",
        "We conducted a randomized clinical trial in a primary care setting. A total of 347 patients aged \u226565 years with a clinically significant depressive episode were randomized to participation in a supervised physical exercise program or to receive antidepressant treatment by their general practitioners.",
        "Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of improvement in depressive symptomatology (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score <10) in the physical activity (PA) group after 1 month was not significantly different from that in the antidepressant treatment (AT) group. However, the proportion of those who showed improvement was significantly greater (<i>P</i> <.01) in the AT group (60.6% and 49.7%) compared to the PA group (45.6% and 32.9%) at the end of 3 and 6 months, respectively. The number of withdrawals was greater in the PA group (39.2% and 58.2%) compared to the AT group (22.6% and 40.0%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively, yet the proportion of participants with adverse side effects was greater in the AT group (8.9% vs 22.5%; <i>P</i> = .007).",
        "Although improvement was initially similar in both treatment groups, AT was superior in the medium term, despite giving rise to a greater number of adverse effects."
