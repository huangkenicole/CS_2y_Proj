        "Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP), but other exercise programs have also been promoted and used. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of hypopressive and other exercise programs besides PFMT for POP.",
        "A literature search was conducted on Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, and Scopus databases from January 1996 to 30 December 2021. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The keywords were combinations of \"pelvic organ prolapse\" or \"urogenital prolapse,\" and \"exercise therapy,\" \"hypopressive exercise,\" \"Kegel,\" \"pelvic floor muscle training,\" \"pelvic floor muscle exercises,\" \"Pilates,\" \"treatment,\" \"yoga,\" \"Tai Chi.\" Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro rating scale (0-10).",
        "Seven RCTs containing hypopressive exercise, yoga or breathing and hip muscle exercises in an inverted position were retrieved and analyzed. PEDro score ranged from 4 to 7. There was no additional effect of adding hypopressive exercise to PFMT, and PFMT was more effective than hypopressive exercise alone. The studies that included the term \"yoga\" included regular PFMT and thus can be classified as PFMT. Hip exercises in an inverted position added to PFMT vs PFMT alone showed better improvement in some secondary outcomes but not in the primary outcome, POP stage.",
        "There are few RCTs assessing the effects of other exercise programs besides PFMT in the treatment of POP. To date, there is no evidence that other exercise programs are more effective than PFMT for POP."
