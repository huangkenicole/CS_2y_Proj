        "Breast cancer patients have to face a high-risk state during chemotherapy, which involves deterioration of their health including extensive physical deterioration. Face-to-face physical exercise programs have presented low adherence rates during medical treatment, and telehealth systems could improve these adherence rates.",
        "This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Web-based exercise program (e-CuidateChemo) to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy on the physical being, anthropometric aspects, and body composition.",
        "A total of 68 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who were undergoing chemotherapy, were enrolled. The patients were categorized into two groups: e-CuidateChemo (n=34) and controls (n=34). The e-CuidateChemo group participated in an adapted 8-week tailored exercise program through a Web-based system. A blinded, trained researcher assessed functional capacity, strength, anthropometric parameters, and body composition. The intervention effects were tested using analysis of covariance and Cohen d tests.",
        "Functional capacity improved significantly in the e-CuidateChemo group compared to the control group (6-minute walk test: 62.07 [SD 130.09] m versus -26.34 [SD 82.21] m; 6-minute walk test % distance predicted: 10.81% [SD 22.69%] m versus -4.60% [SD 14.58%]; between-group effect: P=.015 for both). The intervention group also showed significantly improved secondary outcomes such as between-group effects for abdominal (24.93 [SD 26.83] s vs -18.59 [SD 38.69] s), back (12.45 [SD 10.20] kg vs 1.39 [10.72] kg), and lower body (-2.82 [SD 3.75] s vs 1.26 [SD 2.84] s) strength; all P<.001 compared to the control group.",
        "This paper showed that a Web-based exercise program was effective in reversing the detriment in functional capacity and strength due to chemotherapy.",
