      "AbstractText": [
        "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that Pilates improves cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). However, there is a lack of systematic review studies on this topic. Our aim was to verify the effects of Pilates exercises on CRF in healthy adults.",
        "A systematic literature search was performed in: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, and PEDro (search on January 12, 2023). Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. A meta-analysis was performed using the standardized mean difference (SMD). The quality of evidence was rated by the GRADE system.",
        "In total, 12 RCTs were eligible (569 participants). Only three studies presented high methodological quality. Very low to low quality evidence showed that: a) Pilates was superior to control groups (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.96 [CI<sub>95%</sub> 0.39 to 1.54] n\u00a0=\u00a0457, studies\u00a0=\u00a012), even when only high methodological quality studies were included (SMD\u00a0=\u00a01.14 [CI<sub>95%</sub> 0.25 to 2.04] n\u00a0=\u00a0129, studies\u00a0=\u00a03); b) to be effective, Pilates needed to be performed for \u22651440\u00a0min; c) the effects were significant regardless of the form of Pilates application (mat or equipment); d) Pilates was not different from other exercises regarding the effects on CRF.",
        "Pilates had a large effect on CRF, provided that it was administered for at least 1440\u00a0min (equivalent to 2x-week for three months or 3x-week for two months). However, due to the low quality of the evidence, these results should be interpreted with caution."
