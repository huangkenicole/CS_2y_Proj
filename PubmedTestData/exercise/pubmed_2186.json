        "Physical activity is increasingly recommended for chronic pain. In this review, we briefly survey recent, high-quality meta-analyses on the effects of exercise in human chronic pain populations, followed by a critical discussion of the rodent literature.",
        "Most meta-analytical studies on the effects of exercise in human chronic pain populations describe moderate improvements in various types of chronic pain, despite substantial variability in the outcomes reported in the primary literature. The most consistent findings suggest that while greater adherence to exercise programs produces better outcomes, there is minimal support for the superiority of one type of exercise over another. The rodent literature similarly suggests that while regular exercise reduces hypersensitivity in rodent models of chronic pain, exercise benefits do not appear to relate to either the type of injury or any particular facet of the exercise paradigm. Potential factors underlying these results are discussed, including the putative involvement of stress-induced analgesic effects associated with certain types of exercise paradigms. Exercise research using rodent models of chronic pain would benefit from increased attention to the role of stress in exercise-induced analgesia, as well as the incorporation of more clinically relevant exercise paradigms."
