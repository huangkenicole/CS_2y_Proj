        "This study explored the effects of ground-based walking training on physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (ST) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants were randomised to a walk group (WG) [supervised, ground-based walking training, two or three times per week for 8-10 weeks] or a control group (CG) [usual medical care]. Before and after the intervention period, PA and ST were measured using the SenseWear<sup>\u00ae</sup> Pro3 Armband. Of the 143 participants randomised, 101 (71%) had sufficient data for the primary analysis; 62 were from the WG (mean [SD] age 69 [8] years, FEV<sub>1</sub> 42 [15] % predicted) and 39 were from the CG (age 68 [9] years, FEV<sub>1</sub> 43 [15] % predicted). No between-group differences were demonstrated in any measure of PA or ST (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Secondary analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a044) revealed that, compared to the CG, the proportion of waking hours spent in moderate intensity PA accumulated in uninterrupted bouts of between 30 and 60\u00a0min, increased in the WG by 0.8% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.4 to 1.3). This study demonstrated that, in people with COPD, ground-based walking training alone had little, if any clinically important effect on daily PA and no effect on ST."
