        "<b>Purpose:</b> Physical exercises on unstable surfaces have been largely applied for clinical practice as well as in sports training. Although the unsteadiness can lead to physiological and psychological adaptations, little is known about the autonomic and emotional acute responses during the practice of balance exercises. This study aimed to evaluate both cardiorespiratory and emotional responses while standing on different unstable surfaces. <b>Methods:</b> Eighty-eight healthy participants performed postural balance tasks in three experimental conditions: (1) a rigid surface (control); (2) balance pad; and (3) the Both Sides Up (BOSU) ball. Respiratory activity was recorded through the thoracic movement and the heart rate variability by the electrocardiographic signal during the balance tasks. After the participants evaluated the level of perceived stability and emotional aspects related to each experimental condition. <b>Results:</b> The main results showed that BOSU condition was perceived as more unstable, unpleasant, with higher arousal and lower dominance levels (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.05). Accordingly, participants had also an increase in the mean respiratory frequency and heart rate (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> These results showed that the postural task with greater instability prompted congruent physiological adjustments to ensure the homeostasis in the more challenging condition. Therefore, the cardiorespiratory and emotional responses should be considered to ensure the safety and benefits in rehabilitation programs in which the exercise progression is based on unstable surfaces."
