        "Muscle wasting is highly prevalent in chronic conditions, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), and can result in decreased physical functioning and strength, and impaired ability to perform daily tasks, thus impacting quality of life. Exercise, particularly resistance training, promotes a multitude of benefits, including prevention and management of muscle dysfunction; however, engagement in resistance training is poor. The aim of this study was to understand the views of people with CKD who participated in a research study evaluating a progressive resistance exercise program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 people with CKD Stage 3 and 4. Five themes were identified: experiences of muscle weakness; preconceptions of resistance exercise; experiences of participating in a resistance exercise program; perceived impact of the resistance exercise program; and maintenance of resistance exercise. Parti - cipants believed the resistance exercise program could improve their functional performance and quality of life. They disclosed factors that can enable or deter both uptake and maintenance in training, which can be considered when developing resistance-based exercise programs. Findings highlight the need for patient education and counselling about the importance and implementation of appropriate and progressive resistance exercise training."
