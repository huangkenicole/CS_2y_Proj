        "Physical exercise has been considered to be an efficient mean of preserving cognitive function and it influences both the structural and functional characteristics of the brain. It has especially been shown to increase brain plasticity, the capacity to re-structure brain properties in response to interaction, such as cognitive practice. Studies have also examined the potential additive effect of cognitive training on the documented benefit of physical exercise, commonly, however, not at the neural level. We monitored, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), the brain processes associated with executive functions in older individuals who participated in a 12-month randomized controlled trial including two research arms: physical and cognitive training vs physical training alone. Measurements were conducted at 0\u00a0months, 6\u00a0months, and 12\u00a0months. The addition of cognitive training was associated with better performance in the Stroop test that reflects executive control. The extra benefit of cognitive training was also manifested as decreased modulation of beta frequency band (15-25\u00a0Hz) especially to difficult distractors. As beta band activity is associated with attentional control, this indicates fewer resources needed to inhibit irrelevant sensory inputs. These results imply an enhancing role of cognitive elements integrated with physical training in improving or maintaining executive functions in older individuals."
