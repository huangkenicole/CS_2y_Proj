        "Design Randomised controlled trial, with blinding of operators and outcome assessors.Study population English-speaking patients aged 10 or older and parents with capacity to consent were given a 45-minute audio-visual presentation and written information on orthodontic treatment in one of three formats, either leaflets from British Orthodontic Society, generic mind map or blank mind maps.Data analysis A 30-item closed-ended questionnaire was used to test knowledge of patients and parents before (T0), at 30 minutes (T1) and 6 weeks (T2) after provision of presentation and written information. Questionnaire scores at T0, T1 and T2 were analysed using box plot, histogram and Shapiro-Wilk test.Results Ninety-three patients and 89 parents were eligible for the study, of which 88 patients (94.6%) and 77 parents (86.5%) have completed questionnaires at T0, T1 and T2. There were no significant differences in scores at T0 between the three groups. After presentation and written information were given, all three participant groups scored higher at T1 and T2. The increase in score was higher in mind map groups.Conclusions Use of audio-visual presentation and written information has improved information recall of patients and parents. The study suggests that mind maps are a superior format of written information than leaflets."
