      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of the study was to assess the effects of resistance training with the use of a suspension system on exercise tolerance, evaluated through an exercise test, and the changes in selected echocardiographic parameters of patients after myocardial infarction. The study involved 44 males. The subjects were divided into two groups: Standard (20) and Suspension system (24). All the subjects had undergone an angioplasty with stent implantation. The standard and suspension system groups carried out a 24-day improvement program comprising 22 training units. Each session consisted of endurance, general stamina and resistance training. Instead of resistance training, the experimental group made multijoint exercises with a suspension system. Statistically significant changes in both groups were observed in the parameters of the echocardiographic exercise test, such as test duration (<i>p</i> = 0.000), distance covered (<i>p</i> = 0.000), MET (<i>p</i> = 0.000), VO2max (<i>p</i> = 0.000) and SBPrest (<i>p</i> = 0.013). Additionally, SBPmax in the suspension system group improved (<i>p</i> = 0.035). The echocardiographic test revealed significant improvement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in both groups (SP group <i>p</i> = 0.001, standard group <i>p</i> = 0.005). The lipid profile test in the SP group revealed statistically significant improvement of TC (<i>p</i> = 0.003), HDL (<i>p</i> = 0.000) and LDL (<i>p</i> = 0.005). Training with the suspension system had a positive effect on the change of exercise tolerance level, left ventricular function and blood lipid profile."
