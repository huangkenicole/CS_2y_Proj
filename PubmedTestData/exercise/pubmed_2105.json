        "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by decreased bone mass and impaired microarchitecture resulting in bone fragility and an increased risk of fractures. Prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures among others include adequate physical activity. Epidemiological studies indicate that fewer fractures in active women, regardless of whether it is a result of direct effects on bone or improve coordination, balance and muscle strength. The aim of research was to examine the impact of exercise program for osteoporosis in the duration of four weeks on health and psychological aspects of patient quality of life using the questionnaire SF-36, used before and after the program. The SF-36 is used for self-assessment of health status and represents the operationalization of two general concept of health such as physical and mental health and consists of 36 particles. The study included 39 participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis. All respondents have implemented a program of exercises for osteoporosis in duration 28 days. The program consisted of exercises for osteoporosis, advice on diet, tips on preventing falls, interviews and examinations performed before and during implementation of the program. Results showed that using a short program of exercises and education leads to significant changes in self-reported quality of life of subjects. The study confirmed a statistically significant reduction in pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after the program."
