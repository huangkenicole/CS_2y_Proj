      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Background and Objective:</i> The transient hypofrontality hypothesis predicts that memory function will be impaired during high-intensity exercise, as a result of a need for metabolic and cognitive resources to be allocated toward sustaining movement, as opposed to performing a cognitive task. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate this transient hypofrontality hypothesis. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Experiment 1 involved participants (<i>n</i> = 24; M<sub>age</sub> = 21.9 years) completing four counterbalanced visits. Two visits evaluated working memory function, either at rest or during a high-intensity bout of acute exercise. The other two visits evaluated episodic memory function, either at rest or during a high-intensity bout of acute exercise. Experiment 2 (<i>n</i> = 24; M<sub>age</sub> = 20.9 years) extended Experiment 1 by evaluating memory function (working memory) across 4 counterbalanced conditions, including at rest and during light (30% of heart rate reserve; HRR), moderate (50% HRR) and high-intensity (80% HRR) acute exercise. <i>Results:</i> Experiment 1 demonstrated that, when compared to rest, both working memory and episodic memory were impaired during high-intensity acute exercise. Experiment 2 replicated this effect, but then also showed that, unlike high-intensity acute exercise, memory function was not impaired during low- and moderate-intensity acute exercise. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our experiments provide support for the transient hypofrontality hypothesis. Both working memory and episodic memory are impaired during high-intensity acute exercise. Working memory does not appear to be impaired during lower exercise intensities."
