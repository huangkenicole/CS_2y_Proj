        "Studies have shown the involvement of respiratory characteristics and their relationship with impairments in non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). The effects of core stability with a combined ball and balloon exercise (CBB) on respiratory variables had not been investigated.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of CBB on respiratory variables among NS-LBP patients.",
        "pre- and post-experimental study.",
        "Forty participants were assigned to an experimental group (EG) [n\u00a0=\u00a020] and control group (CG) [n\u00a0=\u00a020] based on the study criteria.",
        "The EG received CBB together with routine physiotherapy and the CG received routine physiotherapy over a period of 8 weeks. Participants were instructed to carry out the exercises for 3 days per week. The training was evaluated once a week and the exercises progressed based on the level of pain.",
        "Primary outcomes were maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). The secondary outcomes were measured in the numeric rating scale (NRS), total faulty breathing scale (TFBS), cloth tape measure (CTM) and lumbo-pelvic stability.",
        "The MIP increased significantly among the EG when compared with that in the CG (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).The EG showed a significant increase in MVV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) when compared to the CG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). There was a significant reduction in pain for both groups. The MEP, TFBS, chest expansion and core stability showed no changes in either group.",
        "CBB was effective in improving respiratory variables among NS-LBP patients."
