        "In clinics, training of the lower trapezius muscle for the rehabilitation of the shoulder is often applied. The narrow-base push-up exercise is considered suitable training of the proximal shoulder complex, but the effect on the lower trapezius muscle has not yet been investigated.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of push-up, push-up plus, and support surfaces on the lower trapezius muscle during the narrow-base push-up exercise.",
        "A total of 11 males participated in this study. Surface electromyographic response of the lower trapezius muscle was examined during the narrow-base push-up exercise.",
        "The lower trapezius muscle activity increased significantly in both the stable and the unstable conditions during the narrow-base push-up phase compared with both conditions during the narrow-base push-up plus phase.",
        "The narrow-base push-up is considered a suitable exercise for strengthening the lower trapezius muscle regardless of support surfaces."
