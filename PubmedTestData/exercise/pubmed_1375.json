        "Individuals commonly experience age-related systemic decreases in skeletal muscle strength, physical function, and mobility, leading to falls and potential associated hip fractures.",
        "To evaluate whether intensive exercise can improve physical function, mobility, and independence in activities of daily living (ADL) and shorten the length of hospital stay in older adults after hip fracture surgery.",
        "This systematic review was conducted under the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed on January 5, 2022 in eight databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The participants included older adults with hip fracture, and the intervention studied was intensive exercise. The outcomes were physical function, mobility, ADLs, and the length of hospital stay. Meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3.",
        "Fifteen studies were included in this review. After hip fracture surgery, intensive exercise improved participants' physical function to a greater extent than regular or no exercise (standardized mean difference [SMD]\u00a0=\u00a00.74; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.23). Intensive exercise was particularly more effective for gait speed (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.30), the timed up-and-go test results (mean difference [MD]\u00a0=\u00a0-4.34, 95%CI: -6.74, -1.94), balance (SMD =0.42, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.89), and ADLs (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.87). The quality of the evidence was low due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.",
        "Intensive exercise early post-operation provides potential additional benefits compared to no or regular exercises on older adults after hip fracture surgery."
