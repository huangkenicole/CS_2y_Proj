        "Poor gait and static balance performance may be associated with trunk muscles in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",
        "The study aims at evaluating the effects of a home-based trunk exercise program on gait and balance performance in Parkinson's disease.",
        "A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 28 individuals with Parkinson's disease with Hoehn & Yahr stage II-IV. The control group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200914) performed upper and lower limb exercises, while the experimental group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200914) engaged in a trunk exercise program. Both groups performed home-based exercises three times daily for 3 weeks. At the end of interventions (post-training) and 4 weeks after post-training (follow-up), static balance (force plate) and gait (motion capture system) were evaluated. Mixed analysis of variance compared time\u2009\u00d7\u2009group interaction (<i>\u03b1</i>\u2009=\u20095%).",
        "No time\u2009\u00d7\u2009group interaction was observed in the center of pressure displacement, center of pressure mean velocity, and anteroposterior and mediolateral center of pressure range during bipedal support with eyes opened and closed; and gait speed, hip, knee, and ankle range of motion during gait analysis. No intragroup differences were found.",
        "Trunk strengthening exercises did not improve gait and balance compared with upper and lower limb exercises. The non-adherence rate (33%) to the remote intervention may have also hindered our results."
