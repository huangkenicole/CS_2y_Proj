        "The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of core stabilization exercise with real-time feedback on balance and gait function in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke.",
        "Nineteen stroke subjects were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into the experimental (n = 10) and control groups (n = 9). Subjects in the experimental group performed core stabilization exercise with real-time feedback training for 30 minutes per day during a period of six weeks. Subjects in the control group performed core stabilization exercise during the same period. This study assessed the kinematic parameters using a portable walkway system, and timed up-and-go test.",
        "Gait velocity showed significantly greater improvement in the experimental group (7.3 \u00b1 5.0 sec) than in the control group (-0.7 \u00b1 10.6). Stride length showed significantly greater increase in the experimental group (13.2 \u00b1 7.9 on the affected side and 12.6 \u00b1 8.0 on the less affected side) than the control group (3.5 \u00b1 8.7 on the affected side and 3.4 \u00b1 8.5 on the less affected side). After training, change in results on the timed up and go test was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group.",
        "Core stabilization exercise using real-time feedback produces greater improvement in gait performance in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients than core stabilization exercise only."
