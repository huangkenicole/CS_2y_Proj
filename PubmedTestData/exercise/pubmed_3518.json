      "AbstractText": [
        "Multimorbidity is a major problem in Europe, increasing the need for prevention and rehabilitation programs. In Germany no guidelines have been developed that focus on patients with multiple chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Benefits of physical activity (PA) and exercise in NCDs have been proven, but most interventions focus on single conditions. The evaluation of the effectiveness, efficiency and safety of PA programs in patients suffering from multiple NCDs and the feasibility of the implementation within the health care service remain open research questions.",
        "The multi-site randomized controlled pragmatic trial includes 320 sedentary subjects with at least two of the following NCDs, either manifested or in a pre-stage with evident risk factors: Cardio-vascular disease, Diabetes mellitus type 2, knee/ hip osteoarthritis and obesity. Participants will be recruited from general practitioners and medical specialists and randomized to standard care of a statutory health insurance or MultiPill-Exercise. Standard care includes a choice of one or a maximum of two 8- to 12-week health programs, including nutrition, exercise, relaxation or special disease management programs. MultiPill-Exercise is based on the bio-psycho-social health model, considering a person-oriented perspective in light of given individual characteristics and context factors. The 24-weeks intervention focuses on aerobic and strengthening exercises in line with the WHO PA recommendations. Psychological and pedagogical elements along with behavior change techniques are implemented to ease the initiation and maintenance of exercise participation and lifestyle change, including nutrition. Primary outcome will be short- and long-term PA measured with the European Health Interview Survey-Physical Activity Questionnaire (EHIS-PAQ). Secondly, the effectiveness of the program on generic, disease specific, economic, and exercise behavioral parameters, as well as program adherence and safety will be evaluated.",
        "Results of this trial evaluate the PA intervention program in people with multiple NCDs in a real-life scenario. It will serve as a proof of concept with the opportunity of translation into routine practice. This approach, as a multi-site RCT with its rigorous methods and standardized operating procedures for the conduction of the intervention, will allow valid conclusions for the implementation of PA interventions in people with multimorbidity.",
        "The trial was registered at www.drks.de (ID: DRKS00025033 ) on 30th September 2021."
