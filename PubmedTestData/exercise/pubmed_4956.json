        "To investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of aerobic exercise therapy in essential hypertensives, 20 patients underwent eight weeks of cycle ergometer training at anaerobic threshold (AT) point. Cardiopulmonary exercise testings with ramp protocol were performed before and at two/four/eight weeks during the training period in order to determine AT and to evaluate the changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2; ml/min/kg), and O2 pulse (ml/min/beat) during exercise. 75g glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was measured before and after exercise therapy. The mean values of systolic blood pressure, oxygen uptake, O2 pulse, before and after exercise therapy were as follows: systolic blood pressure at rest = 160 +/- 19 mmHg and 135 +/- 11 mmHg, systolic blood pressure at AT = 195 +/- 13 mmHg and 180 +/- 10 mmHg, oxygen uptake AT = 12.0 +/- 0.9 ml/min/kg and 14.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min/kg, O2 pulse at AT = 6.8 +/- 1.5 ml/min/beat and 7.6 +/- 1.88 ml/min/beat. After exercise therapy, systolic blood pressure decreased (p less than 0.01), while O2 pulse and VO2 increased (p less than 0.01). Hyperresponse of serum insulin to glucose also improved. These results show that aerobic exercise therapy at AT level has beneficial effects on high blood pressure and improves exercise tolerance and hyperresponse of serum insulin to glucose without any complications."
