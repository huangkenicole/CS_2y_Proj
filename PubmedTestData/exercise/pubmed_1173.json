        "This review compared the effects of eccentric versus concentric exercise training in healthy people and people with metabolic disease. A systematic search on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, SCOPUS and PubMed was conducted in February 2022. Randomised controlled trials conducted on sedentary healthy adults or those with an existing metabolic disease that compared eccentric versus concentric exercise training interventions of four weeks or longer that involved multiple joints and large muscle groups (e.g., walking, whole-body resistance training) were included in the review. The primary outcome was glucose handling, measured as HbA1c, HOMA, fasting glucose or insulin. Measures of cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and functional physical fitness were secondary outcomes. Nineteen trials involving 618 people were included. Results of meta-analyses showed that eccentric exercise had no benefit to glucose handling (HbA1c level; SMD - 0.99; 95% CI, -2.96 to 0.98; n = 74; P = 0.32) but resulted in significant increases in overall muscle strength (SMD 0.70; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.15; n = 224; P = 0.003) and decreases in blood pressure (Systolic Blood Pressure; MD -6.84; 95% CI, -9.84 to -3.84; n = 47, P = 0.00001, and Diastolic Blood Pressure; MD -6.39; 95% CI -9.62 to -3.15; n = 47, P = 0.0001). Eccentric exercise is effective for improving strength and some markers of cardiovascular health compared to traditional exercise modalities. Additional high-quality studies are necessary to validate these results. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021232167)."
