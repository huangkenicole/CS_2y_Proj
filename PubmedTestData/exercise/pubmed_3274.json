        "Exercise can improve physical and mental health for young people at risk for and with HIV, but prevalence rates remain low. This study explored exercise preferences and barriers among young people at risk for and with HIV, and potential gender differences. A total of 129 participants (66.7% male, mean age\u2009=\u200923.8 [SD\u2009=\u20092.1; range: 19-28], 35.7% Black/African American) at-risk for or with HIV were recruited from a larger study and completed an online survey of exercise preferences and barriers. Overall, participants preferred an exercise program that takes place at a fitness center, occurs alone, has a coach/instructor present, is between 30 and 60 minutes, lasts longer than 8 weeks, and includes aerobic and resistance exercises. The fatiguing nature of exercise and cost were common barriers among all genders. Few gender differences emerged. These results should be used to design exercise programs for young adults at risk for and with HIV."
