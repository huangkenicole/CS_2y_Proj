        "To investigate the effects of three modes of aerobic exercise (lower limbs with and without weight bearing and upper limb) for knee osteoarthritis.",
        "Randomized controlled trial.",
        "Sports medicine clinic.",
        "Seventy-eight patients with knee osteoarthritis were divided into 3 groups of resistance training combined with one of three programs of treadmill, cycle ergometer, or arm ergometer aerobic training.",
        "Pain (VAS), patients' opinion about knee status (KOOS questionnaire), and functional performance [6\u202fmin walk test (6MWT), timed up and go test (TUG) and chair stand test].",
        "After 8 weeks, all groups showed significant improvement in the VAS, KOOS and functional tests. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the change in VAS was significantly higher in arm ergometer than in treadmill group (P\u202f=\u202f0.03). Change in TUG was significantly higher in treadmill than arm ergometer group (P\u202f=\u202f0.02). Also, the change of function in sport and recreation (a KOOS dimension) was significantly higher in arm ergometer compared to treadmill group (P\u202f=\u202f0.04).",
        "All modes of aerobic exercise combined with resistance training led to reduced pain and improved function. Nevertheless, arm ergometry may provide greater pain relief and sport performance; while treadmill may cause greater improvement in TUG."
