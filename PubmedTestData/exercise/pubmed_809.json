        "The world's population is aging and promoting healthy cognitive aging is a public health priority and challenge. Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor that has been identified as positively impacting the cognitive health of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. This chapter current evidence from epidemiological and intervention studies (i.e., randomized controlled trials) on the role of physical activity and exercise in promoting cognitive health in older adults both with and without cognitive impairment. Biological sex as a potential moderator of exercise efficacy is also discussed. We conclude with future directions for this rapidly expanding line of research."
