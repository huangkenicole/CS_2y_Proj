        "This study aimed to compare the effect of the Aerobic and Pilates exercises on mental health in inactive older women. Seventy-five inactive aged women were randomly divided into three groups (n\u00a0=\u00a025); aerobic (62.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.87\u00a0years), Pilates (62.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.68\u00a0years), and control group (63.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.35\u00a0years). The Goldberg General Health Questionnaire assessed mental health. The exercise program was performed for 12\u00a0weeks. The results indicate that Pilates exercises are more valuable than aerobic training in depression (<i>p</i> \u2264\u00a0.05). However, in other mental health components, the difference between the two exercise groups was not statistically significant. According to our results, physical activity, particularly Pilates and aerobic exercises, improves physical health and has a close correlation with the mental health of inactive older women. These results highlight the role of these physical exercise training in older women."
