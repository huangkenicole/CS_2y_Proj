        "To observe the effect of acupuncture exercise therapy synchronizing isokinetic muscle strength training on the motor function, stability and proprioception of knee joint, as well as the anxiety emotion in patients after meniscectomy under arthroscopy.",
        "A total of 70 patients after meniscectomy under arthroscopy were randomized into an observation group (35 cases, 2 cases were eliminated\uff0c 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (35 cases, 2 cases were eliminated, 1 case dropped off). Acupuncture was applied at Chize (LU 5), Neixiyan (EX-LE 4), Dubi (ST 35),Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc. on the affective side in the two groups. After 30 min, the needles of the knee joint area were withdrew, while the needle at elbow was continuously retained, the observation group was given acupuncture exercise therapy synchronizing isokinetic muscle strength training, and the control group was given conventional acupuncture exercise therapy. The treatment was given once a day, 7-day treatment was taken as one course, and totally 4 courses were required in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the knee joint Lysholm score, the knee joint isokinetic muscle strength flexion/extension ratio (H/Q), joint position sense measurement (JPS) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) score were compared in the two groups.",
        "After treatment, the knee joint Lysholm scores and H/Q were increased compared with those before treatment in the two groups (<i>P</i><0.001), and the knee joint Lysholm score and H/Q in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001); the JPS and HAMA scores were decreased compared with those before treatment in the two groups (<i>P</i><0.001), the JPS and HAMA score in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05).",
