        "To examine the effect of 12-week exercise program on cognitive function in people with epilepsy.",
        "Twenty-one physically inactive subjects were randomized into two groups: the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). EG performed 12\u00a0weeks of combined physical training. CG was advised to maintain usual daily activities. EG received a structured, individually supervised exercise program with two 60-minute sessions per week. Each session included warmup (5-minutes), aerobic (15-20\u00a0minutes at 14-17 on Borg scale), strength (2-3 sets, 10-15 repetitions), and 5-minute active stretches. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical information, memory (Digit Span Test [DST]), executive function (Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B), Stroop Color and Word Test, a verbal fluency task, global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and hip and waist circumferences), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption [VO<sub>2</sub> max]), and strength (dynamometer) were measured at baseline and after the 12-week intervention.",
        "Exercise decreased time spent on TMT-A from baseline to postintervention (difference = -7.9\u00a0seconds, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -14.5 to -1.3, P\u00a0=\u00a0.023). EG improved total number of words on the verbal fluency task after intervention (difference = 8.1 words, 95% CI = 3.0 to 13.2, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). EG also improved the score on MoCA at 1.7 (95% CI = 0.1 to 3.3, P\u00a0=\u00a0.043) points. We observed a 22.4% (95% CI = 13.1 to 31.6, P\u00a0=\u00a0.021) improvement in executive function in EG. No effect of group, time, or group \u00d7 time was observed on any other cognitive test. Changes in VO<sub>2</sub> max were negatively associated with changes in performance on DST (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.445, P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) and overall memory score (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.544, P\u00a0=\u00a0.042).",
        "This randomized controlled trial provided the first evidence that combined physical training improves executive function in adults with epilepsy, showing main improvements in attention and language tasks. Physical exercise should be encouraged for people with epilepsy to reduce the burden on cognitive function associated with this disease."
