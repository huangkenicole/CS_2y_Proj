        "Injury prevention of knee injuries by means of training and warm-up exercises has been investigated in several studies in amateur football. However, the number of investigations in elite football is limited despite the currently higher injury incidence of severe knee injuries. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether specifically adapted preventive training modules may reduce severe knee injuries in elite football.",
        "In a prospective controlled cohort study of elite football players in Germany, an injury prevention programme with 5 modules was implemented in the season of 2015-2016. The training modules were specifically adapted to this skill level and based on scientific evidence, team coach preferences, and the specific environment of this playing level. Of the 62 teams taking part in this study, 26 used the new trainings modules and 36 continued their standard programme as a control group. Success of the programme was documented by means of an injury report over one season. The primary outcome was reduction in severe knee injuries.",
        "A pre-seasonal investigation had identified five modules to be implemented in the training routine. Postural stability, mobilisation of lower extremity joints, leg and trunk stabilisation, jumping, and landing exercises as well as agility movements were incorporated into the programme to prevent severe knee injuries in elite football. Over the season, the study group (529 players) with the adapted training modules had sustained 52 severe knee injuries (incidence: 0.38 per 1000\u00a0h football exposure; prevalence: 9.8%) compared to 108 severe knee injuries in the control group (601 players) using the standard programme (incidence: 0.68 per 1000\u00a0h football exposure; prevalence: 18.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.05). The overall injury incidence for any other type of injury was comparable between the two groups (3.3 vs. 3.4 in h 1000 football, n.s.).",
        "Appropriate preventive training modules reduce severe knee injuries in elite football significantly. The key for the sustainability of preventive training measures are programmes specifically adapted to the demands of the playing level and to the preferences of the coaches LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II."
