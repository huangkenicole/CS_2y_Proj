        "To evaluate the feasibility of the multimodal interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme HAPPY, targeting patients with haematological malignancy and undergoing allogeneic non-myeloablative haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (NMA-HSCT).",
        "A single arm longitudinal design was applied to test the feasibility of the 6-month HAPPY programme, which consisted of motivational interviewing dialogues, individual supervised physical exercise training, relaxation exercises, nutritional counselling, and home assignments. The feasibility measures included acceptability, fidelity, exposure, practicability, and safety. Descriptive statistics were conducted.",
        "From November 2018 to January 2020, thirty patients (mean age (SD) 64.1 (6.5)) were enrolled in HAPPY, of whom 18 patients completed the programme. Acceptance was 88%; attrition 40%; fidelity was 80%-100% for all HAPPY elements except phone calls; exposure of HAPPY elements at the hospital reflected individual differences but was acceptable, whereas exposure of HAPPY elements at home was low. Planning of HAPPY for the individual patient was time consuming, and patients were dependent of reminders and incites from the health care professionals.",
        "Most elements of the rehabilitation programme HAPPY were feasible. Yet, HAPPY will benefit from further development and simplifications before an effectiveness study can be conducted, especially regarding improvement of the intervention elements supporting patients at home."
