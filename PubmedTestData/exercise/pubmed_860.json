        "Weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB) exercises are commonly used in rehabilitation programs for patients with anterior knee pain (AKP).",
        "To determine the immediate effects of isolated WB or NWB knee-extension exercises on quadriceps torque output and activation in individuals with AKP.",
        "A single-blind randomized controlled trial.",
        "Laboratory.",
        "30 subjects with self-reported AKP.",
        "Subjects performed a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the quadriceps (knee at 90\u00b0). Maximal voluntary quadriceps activation was quantified using the central activation ratio (CAR): CAR = MVIC/(MVIC + superimposed burst torque). After baseline testing, subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups: WB knee extension, NWB knee extension, or control. WB knee-extension exercise was performed as a sling-based exercise, and NWB knee-extension exercise was performed on the Biodex dynamometer. Exercises were performed in 3 sets of 5 repetitions at approximately 55% MVIC. Measurements were obtained at 4 times: baseline and immediately and 15 and 30 min postexercise.",
        "Quadriceps torque output (MVIC: N\u00b7m/Kg) and quadriceps activation (CAR).",
        "No significant differences in the maximal voluntary quadriceps torque output (F2,27 = 0.592, P = .56) or activation (F2,27 = 0.069, P = .93) were observed among the 3 treatment groups.",
        "WB and NWB knee-extension exercises did not acutely change quadriceps torque output or activation. It may be necessary to perform exercises over a number of sessions and incorporate other disinhibitory interventions (eg, cryotherapy) to observe acute changes in quadriceps torque and activation."
