        "Acute reduction in blood pressure (BP) following an exercise session is evidenced in controlled settings with formal supervision in hypertensive older populations. This study investigated the effect of a self-selected exercise (SSE)-intensity session on ambulatory BP in hypertensive older women in a \"real-world\" setting.",
        "Twenty inactive older women with hypertension (64.9\u00b14.5 years) were included in this randomized, controlled, crossover trial. After baseline assessments, participants performed 30 minutes of an SSE-intensity session on an outdoor track and a control session, separated by 7-10 days. Heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and affective response were assessed. Ambulatory BP was monitored for 20 hours following both sessions. Paired <i>t</i>-tests and generalized estimation were used for data analysis.",
        "Participants exercised at 5.1\u00b11.1 km/h, spent ~90% of the exercise time at moderate-vigorous intensity (\u226540% of heart rate reserve). SSE-intensity session was reported as light (RPE 11.0\u00b11.5) and pleasant (affect 3.4\u00b11.2). SSE-intensity session elicited reductions in systolic BP in the first 6 hours postexercise (6.0 mmHg, CI 2.7-9.3 mmHg; <i>P<</i>0.001). Average systolic BP in the 20-hour (-3.4 mmHg, CI -5.9 to -0.9 mmHg; <i>P</i>=0.010) and awake (-4.0 mmHg, CI -6.4 to -1.6 mmHg; <i>P</i>=0.003) periods were lower following SSE-intensity session compared to control session. No differences were observed in average systolic BP during asleep period and diastolic BP during the 20-hour awake and asleep periods between the SSE-intensity session and control session (<i>P</i>>0.05).",
        "An SSE-intensity session elicited a reduction in ambulatory systolic BP in inactive older women with hypertension during awake and 20-hour periods. Also, the SSE-intensity session was reported as light and pleasant."
