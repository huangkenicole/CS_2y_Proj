      "AbstractText": [
        "The warm-up and injury prevention program FIFA\u00a011+ was developed to reduce injuries in recreational and amateur level football. Despite systematic education it is uncertain what amount of knowledge is passed down to the lower recreational level football players and what exercises are implemented in the daily routine. This study presents the summarized experiences of German coaches about the implementation of exercises on the football pitch.",
        "In this study 142 coaches who participated in 1 (of 5) of the 2\u2011day courses between 2013 and 2017 were sent a\u00a0questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 24\u00a0questions, which were developed by the football union of Lower Saxony. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded from the study.",
        "A total of 121 questionnaires could be analyzed, which is a\u00a0response rate of 85.2%. The mean time period between the 2\u2011day training and answering the questionnaire was 29\u00a0months. Of the participating coaches 82.6% indicated that they use the program regularly (22% of the coaches use it twice a\u00a0week or more frequently, 34% use it only once a\u00a0week) and 6% of the coaches use additional programs to prevent injuries. A total of 86% of the participants believed in a\u00a0reduction in the incidence of injuries induced by the FIFA\u00a011+ concept, 89% of the participants rated the FIFA\u00a011+ program as good ors very good, 91% rated the teaching concept as good or very good and 94% of the participants would recommend the 2\u2011day advanced course to others.",
        "The prevention program as well as the advanced training concept were evaluated very positively. Most coaches use the program regularly. Nevertheless, many coaches use the FIFA\u00a011+ exercises less than the recommended twice a\u00a0week. Most coaches praised the good structure of the program, but also wished for the possibility of variations.",
        "The prevention program FIFA\u00a011+ is seen by coaches in recreational and amateur football as an effective tool to prevent injury. Implementation on the football pitch is regular but not as frequent as the evidence-based recommendations in the training concept."
