        "High-intensity gait training is recommended in stroke rehabilitation to improve gait speed, walking distance, and balance. However, identifying effective and efficient implementation methods is a challenge for rehabilitation providers. This article describes the development of an implementation plan, presents findings of each implementation phase, and identifies the project's impact on clinicians and the health system.",
        "Two inpatient rehabilitation facilities, including 9 physical therapists, collaborated with a knowledge translation center to implement this program. We developed an implementation plan using the Knowledge-to-Action Framework and utilized the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to identify barriers and select implementation strategies. Using mix-methods research, including surveys and informal discussions, we evaluated current practice, barriers, outcomes, and the sustainability of high-intensity gait training in practice.",
        "A multicomponent implementation plan that targeted barriers was developed. Before implementation, clinicians reported providing several balance, strength training, and gait interventions to improve walking. Barriers to using high-intensity gait training included knowledge, beliefs, adaptability of high-intensity gait training, resources, culture, and others. Twenty-six implementation strategies were selected to target the barriers. Surveys and informal discussions identified significant changes in perceived practice, adoption of high-intensity gait training, and positive impacts on the health system. The 2-year follow-up survey indicated that the new practice was sustained.",
        "Using a multicomponent implementation plan that targeted barriers, we successfully implemented high-intensity gait training in clinical practice. Contributors to successful implementation may include the implementation methods, usual care interventions, and clinicians' readiness for this change.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A352.)."
