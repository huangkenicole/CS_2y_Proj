        "Acute bouts of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) transiently lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the hours after termed postexercise hypotension (PEH); however, the effects of sprint interval training (SIT) exercise have yet to be explored in middle-age adults. Although previous work has found no effect of exercise intensity on PEH, no study has compared submaximal, near maximal, and supramaximal intensities, specifically in middle-age adults where blood pressure (BP) management strategies may be of greater importance.",
        "This study examined the effects of MICT, HIIT, and SIT exercises on PEH in the immediate (\u22642 h) and 24 h after exercise specifically in middle-age adults.",
        "Fourteen participants (10 female; age, 46 \u00b1 9 yr; SBP, 116 \u00b1 11 mm Hg; DBP, 67 \u00b1 6 mm Hg; one hypertensive, four prehypertensive, nine normotensive) had their BP measured before, immediately (15, 30, 60, 120 min), and over 24 h after four experimental sessions: 1) 30-min MICT exercise (65% maximal oxygen consumption), 2) 20-min HIIT exercise (10 \u00d7 1 min at 90% maximum heart rate with 1-min rest), 3) 16-min SIT exercise (8 \u00d7 15 s all-out sprints with 2-min rest), and 4) no-exercise control. Postexercise BP was compared with no-exercise control.",
        "PEH was similar for all exercise sessions for SBP ( P = 0.388, = 0.075) and DBP ( P = 0.206, = 0.108). Twenty-four-hour average SBP was similar for all sessions P = 0.453, = 0.069), and DBP was similar over 24 h except after MICT exercise compared with HIIT exercise ( P = 0.018, d = 1.04).",
        "In middle-age adults, MICT, HIIT, and SIT exercises are effective at reducing SBP; however, the effects on DBP are smaller, and neither reductions are sustained over 24 h."
