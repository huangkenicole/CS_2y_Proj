        "To compare the effects of yoga and aerobic exercise (AE) on wellbeing in physically inactive, but otherwise healthy older adults. A secondary objective was to assess and compare the frequency of adverse events associated with yoga and AE.",
        "Twelve-week, three-group, parallel randomized controlled trial with blinded follow-up assessment.",
        "Participants were supported to complete \u2265\u00a03 Hatha yoga classes/week or \u2265\u00a03 AE sessions/week. A wait-list control (WLC) group continued usual daily activities.",
        "Change in wellbeing, assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Life Satisfaction Index-Z (LSI),at baseline and at 12-week follow up.",
        "In total, 82 adults (mean age 72.5 years, range 65-85, 77% female) were recruited. Of these, 27 were randomized to yoga, 29 to aerobic exercise and 26 to wait-list control. Medium-magnitude treatment effects (Hedges' g) were seen for yoga versus WLC and AE versus WLC(SWLS, g = 0.65 and 0.56; LSI, g = 0.54 and 0.54, respectively). In per-protocol analyses, larger effect sizes were found (SWLS, g = 0.72 and 0.66; LSI, g = 0.76 and 0.76, respectively). Adverse events were less frequent in the yoga group (6/27; 22%) compared to AE (10/27; 37%).",
        "Among physically inactive older adults, participation in yoga or AE was associated with beneficial effects on subjective wellbeing when compared to a non-active control group. Yoga was associated with fewer injuries and may be especially suitable for older adults (DRKS 00015093)."
