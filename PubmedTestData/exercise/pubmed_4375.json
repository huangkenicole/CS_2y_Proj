        "32 articles met the established criteria and the main findings were summarized and described, including indication, contraindication and recommendation for early rehabilitation and exercises prescription.",
        "The literature suggests that early mobilization and physical exercise are beneficial for individuals with COVID-19. However, much of what has been published is based on expert opinion due to a lack of randomized trials, which are needed."
