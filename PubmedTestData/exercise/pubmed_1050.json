        "The KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd screening test is a self-administered screening tool for assessment of mobility, stability, and strength. It provides corrective exercises corresponding to the individual's answers to the KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd test questions. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of corrective exercises in improving KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd screening test scores and activity-related pain.",
        "Twenty-six healthy subjects (11 female and 15 male ; age 20?50 years) were selected for participation. In a controlled laboratory setting, subjects were administered the KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd test and were provided with individualized exercise programs based on the results of this first test. KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd results were checked on the first day immediately after the first exercise session, and then again after the two-week program. Pain intensity was also assessed during daily training using a numerical rating scale.",
        "Compared to pre-intervention, KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd scores were significantly higher immediately after the first corrective exercise session and after 2 weeks of intervention (p<0.001). Moreover, pain intensity was significantly lower after 2 weeks of intervention (p<0.001).",
        "Individualized KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd corrective exercises were effective immediately on the first day and also after the two-week program in improving the KOJI AWARENESS\ufffd score and reducing pain intensity during daily training. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 208-212, February, 2023."
