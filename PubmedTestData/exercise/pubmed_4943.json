        "Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability with first signs appearing in children aged 3 years and younger. Given that autism spectrum disorder is accompanied by a broad range of symptoms such as impaired sensory, neurological, and neuromotor functions, it appears plausible to argue that an intervention program focusing on multimodal exercise rather than single-mode exercise might be more effective in treating this wide variety of symptoms.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a multimodal exercise program entitled Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids on variables of ground reaction forces and plantar pressure during walking in boys with autism spectrum disorder.",
        "Twenty-four autism spectrum disorder boys aged 7-11 years were recruited and randomly allocated into an intervention or a waiting control group. Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids was conducted over a period of 8 weeks with three weekly sessions. This training protocol includes aerobic dance and jump rope exercises as well as running games. Pre- and post-training, ground reaction forces and plantar pressure variables were recorded while walking at a constant walking speed of 0.9 m/s using a foot scan embedded in a 15-m walkway.",
        "Significant group-by-time interactions were found for the first peak of vertical ground reaction force, loading rate, and peak pressure at the medial heel region (all p = 0.001-0.49, d = 0.89-1.40). Post-hoc analyses showed significant pre-post decreases for the first peak of vertical ground reaction force (p = 0.001, d = 1.27), loading rate (p = 0.009, d = 1.11), and peak pressure at the medial heel region (p = 0.021, d = 1.01).",
        "Our results suggest that a joyful and multimodal exercise program has positive effects on kinetic walking characteristics of autism spectrum disorder boys. Accordingly, we recommend to implement this type of exercise in prepubertal autism spectrum disorder boys to improve gait kinetics.",
