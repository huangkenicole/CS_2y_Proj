        "To determine the effects of exergaming (EXE) on quality of life (QOL), motor, and clinical symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). We compared the effects of EXE, balance (BAL), cycling (CYC), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), and a standard care wait-listed control group on clinical and motor symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in people with MS (PwMS) and determined the effects of subsequent maintenance programs for 2 years in a hospital setting.",
        "A randomized controlled trial, using before-after test design.",
        "University hospital setting.",
        "Of 82 outpatients with MS, 70 were randomized (N=70), and 68 completed the study.",
        "The initial high-intensity and high-frequency interventions consisted of 25 one-hour sessions over 5 weeks. After the 5-week-long initial intervention, the 2-year-long maintenance programs followed, consisting of 3 sessions per week, each for 1 hour.",
        "The primary outcome: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29).",
        "Measures 5 aspects of health-related QOL (EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire), Beck Depression Inventory, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Tinetti Assessment Tool (TAT), and static BAL (center of pressure).",
        "MSIS-29 improved most in EXE (11 points), BAL (6), and CYC (6) (all P&lt;.05). QOL improved most in EXE (3 points), CYC, and BAL (2) (all P&lt;.05). TAT and BBS improved significantly (P&lt;.05) but similarly (P&gt;.05) in EXE, BAL, and CYC. 6MWT improved most in EXE (57m), BAL (32m), and CYC (19m) (all P&lt;.001). Standing sway did not change. Maintenance programs further increased the initial exercise-induced gains, robustly in EXE.",
        "A total of 25 sessions of EXE, BAL, CYC, and PNF, in this order, improved clinical and motor symptoms and QOL, and subsequent 2-year-long thrice weekly maintenance programs further slowed symptom worsening and improved QOL. EXE was the most and PNF was the least effective to improve clinical symptoms, motor function, and QOL in PwMS."
