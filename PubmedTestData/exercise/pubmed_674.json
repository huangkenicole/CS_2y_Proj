      "AbstractText": [
        "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often require a lengthy duration of rehabilitation for patients to return to their prior level of function. Adherence to rehabilitation during this prolonged period can be subpar due to the treatment duration and poor adherence to home exercises. This work evaluates whether a smart instrumented knee brace system is capable of monitoring knee range of motion and velocity during a series of common knee rehabilitation exercises and an exergame. A total of 15 healthy participants completed a series of common knee rehabilitation exercises and played an exergame while wearing a smart instrumented knee brace. The range of motion (ROM) and velocity of the knee recorded by the knee brace was compared to a reference optoelectronic system. The results show good agreement between the knee brace system and the reference system for all exercises performed. Participants were able to quickly learn how to play the exergame and scored well within the game. The system investigated in this study has the potential to allow rehabilitation to occur outside of the clinic with the use of remote monitoring, and improve adherence and outcomes through the use of an exergame."
