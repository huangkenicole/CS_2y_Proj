        "The present study aims to assess the effect of different modalities of physical exercises (\"Functional Gymnastics\"-FG, \"Resistance Training\"-RT and \"Pilates combined with Hydrogymnastics\"-PCH) on functional capacity and anthropometric measurements of 148 older women (60 years old or more). A comparative observational study was conducted. Functional and anthropometric measurements were assessed at baseline and after 16 weeks. All groups assessed showed significant changes between baseline and post-training. On the comparison of pre and post-training, differences in anthropometric measurements but not in functional test performance were found. The PCH had greater weight loss compared to the FG and RT, reduction in BMI compared to the FG and RT; reduction in waist compared to the FG and RT, and in hip compared to the RT. Although all groups improved, Pilates/Hydrogymnastics combination was more strongly associated with reductions in weight, BMI, waist and hip measurements but not functionality, than other modalities. These results highlight the role of combination physical exercise training in older women."
