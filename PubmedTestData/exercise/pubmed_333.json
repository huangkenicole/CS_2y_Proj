        "A 5-minute intervention activity after 1\u2009hour of occupational whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure may provide protection against detriments in reaction time.Intervention activities that include a gaze stabilization exercise component maintained the slowest reaction speeds after 1\u2009hour of WBV exposure, whereas sitting and walking activities resulted in a further slowing of the slowest reaction speeds.It may be possible for machinery operators to incorporate gaze stabilization activities in occupational environments, either in or out-of-cab, but further evaluation for feasibility and practicality of in-field adoption is required."

      "AbstractText": [
        "Eleven healthy adults participated in four 1-hour sessions of ecologically valid WBV exposure followed by one of four 5-minute activities: sitting, walking, 2\u2009min of gaze stabilization exercise (GSE) coupled with 3\u2009min of trunk mobility exercise (GSE\u2009+\u2009MOBIL), or 2\u2009min of GSE coupled with a 3-minute walk (GSE\u2009+\u2009WALK). Baseline and post-activity measurements (rating of perceived discomfort, balance and postural sway measurements, 5-minute psychomotor vigilance task test) were submitted to a paired t-test to determine the effect of WBV exposure and activities on physical, cognitive, and sensorimotor systems and to a repeated measures ANOVA to determine any differences across activities.",
        "We observed degradation of the slowest 10% reaction speed outcomes between baseline and post-activity after walking (7.3%, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) and sitting (8.6%, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) but not after GSE\u2009+\u2009MOBIL or GSE\u2009+\u2009WALK activities. Slowest 10% reaction speed after GSE\u2009+\u2009MOBIL activity was faster than all other activities. The rating of perceived discomfort was higher after SIT and WALK activities. There were no notable differences in balance outcomes.",
        "When compared to sitting for 5\u2009min, an activity including GSE and an active component, such as walking or trunk mobility exercises, resulted in maintenance of reaction time after WBV exposure. If confirmed in occupational environments, GSE may provide a simple, rapid, effective, and inexpensive means to protect against decrements in reaction time after WBV exposure."
