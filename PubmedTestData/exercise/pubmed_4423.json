        "Scapular focused exercise interventions are frequently used to treat individuals with shoulder pain. However, evidence for changes in scapular motion after intervention is limited.",
        "To compare the effects of scapular movement training versus standardized exercises for individuals with shoulder pain.",
        "This will be a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four individuals with shoulder pain for at least 3 months, scapular dyskinesis, and a positive scapular assistance test will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: Scapular Movement Training (group 1) and Standardized Exercises (group 2). Group 1 will receive education about scapular position and movement, and be trained to modify the scapular movement pattern. Group 2 will perform stretching and strengthening exercises. Both groups will be treated twice a week for eight weeks. Three-dimensional scapular kinematics and muscle activity of the serratus anterior and upper, middle, and lower trapezius during elevation and lowering of the arm will be assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. Pain intensity, function, fear avoidance beliefs, and kinesiophobia will be assessed at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and 4 weeks after the end of treatment.",
        "The results of this study may contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy of scapular focused treatments for individuals with shoulder pain.",
