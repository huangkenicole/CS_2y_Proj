        "Exercise training is included in cardiac rehabilitation programs to enhance physical capacity and cardiovascular function. Among the existing rehabilitation programs, exercises in water are increasingly prescribed. However, it has been questioned whether exercises in water are safe and relevant in patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) with normal systolic left ventricular function. The goal was to assess whether a rehabilitation program, including water-based gymnastic exercises, is safe and induces at least similar benefits as a traditional land-based training.",
        "Twenty-four male CAD patients and 24 male CHF patients with stable clinical status participated in a 3-week rehabilitation. They were randomized to either a group performing the training program totally on land (CADl, CHFl; endurance + callisthenic exercises) or partly in water (CADw, CHFw; land endurance + water callisthenic exercises). Before and after rehabilitation, left ventricular systolic and cardiorespiratory functions, hemodynamic variables and autonomic nervous activities were measured. No particular complications were associated with both of our programs. At rest, significant improvements were seen in CHF patients after both types of rehabilitation (increases in stroke volume and left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) as well as a decrease in heart rate (HR) and in diastolic arterial pressure. Significant increases in peaks VO(2), HR, and power output were observed in all patients after rehabilitation in exercise test. The increase in LVEF at rest, in HR and power output at the exercise peak were slightly higher in CHFw than in CHFl.",
        "Altogether, both land and water-based programs were well tolerated and triggered improvements in cardiorespiratory function."
