        "Neck pain is a common musculoskeletal problem in adults. Clinical pilates exercises can be beneficial managing the pain and improving the risk factors.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clinical pilates exercises on pain and disability, deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE), posture, cervical range of motion (CROM), and proprioception in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain.",
        "Fifty patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain were randomized into two groups. The clinical pilates exercise group (CPEG) received clinical pilates exercises for 6\u00a0weeks. The control group (CG) received posture education. Pain and disability, DNFE, forward head angle (FHA) and forward shoulder angle (FSA) degrees, CROM, and joint position error (JPE) were measured before and after 6\u00a0weeks.",
        "Clinical pilates exercises improved pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI), DNFE, posture, CROM (except extension), and JPE (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We found significant differences between CPEG and CG in the comparisons for the change of pain, NDI, DNFE, FSA, CROM (except extension), and JPE (except left rotation) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). NDI, FSA, and rotational JPE also improved in CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, these improvements were significantly better in CPEG than CG (p\u2009<\u20090.05) except JPE in left rotation (p\u2009=\u20090.118).",
        "In patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain, clinical pilates exercise is a safe and effective method to improve pain and disability, DNFE, posture, ROM, and proprioception.",
