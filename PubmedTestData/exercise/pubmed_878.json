        "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> This study examined the effects of motor-cognitive dual-task exergaming standing balance training on healthy older adults' static, dynamic, and walking balance. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Twenty-four adults older than 70 years (control group: <i>n</i>\u2009=\u20099, males\u2009=\u20096, balance training group: <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200915, males\u2009=\u20098) completed the experiment. Dual-tasking standing balance training comprised the accurate control of a ping-pong ball on a tray held with both hands, while standing on one leg (analog training) and three modules of Wii Fit\u2122 exergaming (digital training). The duration of balance training was \u223c15 minutes per day, 2 days per week for 8 weeks, in total 16 sessions. We measured one-leg standing time, functional reach distance, walking balance evaluated by the distance walked on a narrow beam (4-cm long, 4-cm wide, and 2-cm high) with single and dual tasking, habitual and maximal walking speed, and muscle strength of the hip extensor, hip abductor, hip adductor, knee extensor, and plantarflexor muscle groups in the right leg at baseline and after 8 weeks. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Control group decreased, but balance training group increased one-leg standing time. Only the balance training group improved functional reach distance and hip and knee extensor strength. There was no change in walking speed and walking balance in either group. In the balance training group, changes in maximal speed correlated with changes in dual-tasking walking balance and changes in one-leg standing time correlated with changes in single-tasking walking balance. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> These results suggest that 16 sessions of motor-cognitive dual-task standing exergaming balance training substantially improved healthy older adults' static and dynamic balance and leg muscle strength but failed to improve walking speed and walking balance. Balance exercises specific to walking balance need to be included in balance training to improve walking balance."
