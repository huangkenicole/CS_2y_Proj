        "To establish how guided physical activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without known cardiovascular disease affected vascular and cardiac function, and how these two entities were prospectively interconnected in this patient group.",
        "Prospective substudy of 29 participants in the Physical Activity in RA (PARA) 2010 trial. All subjects were examined at baseline, at year 1 and 2 with measures of pulse wave velocity and arterial augmentation index, as well as echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic parameters and ventricular-arterial coupling. Muscle strength and aerobic exercise capacity were assessed at baseline and yearly. All participants performed physiotherapist-guided aerobic and muscle strength exercise during 2\u00a0years and were reminded through SMS to report physical activity progress.",
        "This cohort of patients with RA exhibited increased vascular stiffness despite normal blood pressure. At baseline, lower muscle strength was associated with increased vascular stiffness (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.68; P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), whereas lower aerobic working capacity was associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.85; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). There was a significant positive correlation between vascular stiffness and diastolic dysfunction at baseline (R<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.64) and for the changes in those parameters observed during 2\u00a0years of guided physical activity. Finally, a significant improvement in ventricular-arterial coupling was observed after exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "These results indicate that although differentially associated with physical capacity parameters, improved vascular stiffness and improved diastolic dysfunction are interrelated, and that an optimization of the ventricular-arterial coupling may contribute to the beneficial effects of physical activity in patients with RA."
