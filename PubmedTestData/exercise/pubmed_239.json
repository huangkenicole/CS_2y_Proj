      "AbstractText": [
        "There is increasing evidence suggesting that cognition and physical frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with aging which has been called cognitive frailty. Exercise programs have demonstrated to be an effective tool to prevent functional and cognitive decline during aging, but little is known about their potential to restore or maintain functionality in individuals that require long-term nursing care. Besides, WHO has recently highlighted the importance of introducing systematic musculoskeletal health programs for older people living in residential care, as they represent a particularly vulnerable group for the development of noncommunicable diseases.",
        "This is a multicentre randomized controlled trial. 114 participants will be randomly allocated to a usual care group or to an intervention group. Inclusion criteria are as follows: \u2265 70\u00a0years, \u2265 50 on the Barthel Index, \u2265 20 on MEC-35 who are capable to stand up and walk independently for 10\u00a0m. Subjects in the intervention group will add to the activities scheduled for the control group the participation in a 6\u00a0months long multicomponent exercise program designed to improve strength, balance and walking retraining. Study assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3 and 6\u00a0months. The primary outcome is change in function assessed by Short Physical Performance Battery and secondary outcomes include other measurements to assess all together the condition of frailty, which includes functionality, sedentary behaviors, cognitive and emotional status and biological markers. The present study has been approved by the Committee on Ethics in Research of the University of the Basque Country (Humans Committee Code M10/2016/105; Biological Samples Committee Code M30/2016/106).",
        "Results from this research will show if ageing related functional and cognitive deterioration can be effectively prevented by physical exercise in institutionalized elders. It is expected that the results of this research will guide clinical practice in nursing home settings, so that clinicians and policymakers can provide more evidence-based practice for the management of institutionalized elder people.",
        "The protocol has been registered under the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with the identifier: ACTRN12616001044415 ."
