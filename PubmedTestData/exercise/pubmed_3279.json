      "AbstractText": [
        "Fibromyalgia guidelines indicate that exercise is critical in the management of fibromyalgia, and there is evidence that patients with fibromyalgia can perform resistance training at moderate and high intensities. However, despite the biological plausibility that progression of intensity provides greater benefit to individuals, no studies have compared different intensities (progressive versus constant intensities) of the same exercise in this population.",
        "To compare the effect of 24 sessions of resistance training (progressive vs. constant intensity) on impact of fibromyalgia, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, pain, walking ability, and musculoskeletal capacity.",
        "A protocol for a blinded randomized controlled trial. The sample will be randomized into three groups: group 1 (progressive intensity, experimental), group 2 (constant intensity, control A), and group 3 (walking, control B). Group 1 will perform resistance training at moderate intensity (50% of maximum dynamic strength), previously determined by the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) test in the proposed exercises. The strength of each individual will be reassessed every 4 weeks (by 1-RM) and the intensity of each exercise will be positively adjusted by 20% of the value observed in kg (i.e., first month 50%; second month 70%; third month 90% of the maximum dynamic strength). Group 2 will perform the same procedure, but the intensity will be maintained at 50% of the maximum dynamic strength throughout the treatment (i.e., constant intensity from the first to the third month). Group 3 will perform a 40-minute treadmill walk at low intensity, defined by a walking speed corresponding to 60-70% of the maximum heart rate, which we will control with a heart rate monitor. All groups will receive a 45-minute pain education session prior to the exercise program, covering the pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic pain, strategies for coping with pain, avoiding hypervigilance, and deconstructing beliefs and myths about chronic pain.",
        "The results of the present study may help health care professionals adjust the intensity of resistance training and thus plan the most effective intervention (progressive or constant intensity) to reduce the impact of fibromyalgia on patients' lives.",
