        "Several exercise methods, such as the Shaker exercise, tongue press exercise, chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) exercise, and submandibular push exercise, have been introduced to strengthen the muscles involved in swallowing. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of the CTAR, submandibular push, and Shaker exercises for the induction of selective supra- and infrahyoid muscle contractions using surface electromyography (EMG). This study is a prospective non-randomized controlled study. Twenty-five healthy subjects and 20 patients experiencing swallowing difficulty were enrolled. During the three different types of exercises, the root mean square (RMS) values of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), suprahyoid (anterior belly of the digastric and mylohyoid muscles), and infrahyoid (sternothyroid and thyrohyoid muscles) muscles were analyzed using surface EMG. Differences in the activity of swallowing muscles among the three different exercises were analyzed using one-way repeated measured analysis of variance. In terms of both the maximum and mean RMS values of the suprahyoid muscle, the submandibular push exercise showed a larger RMS value than the CTAR and Shaker exercises in healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In terms of both the maximum and mean RMS values of the suprahyoid muscle, the Shaker exercise and submandibular push exercise showed a larger RMS value than the CTAR exercise in patients with swallowing difficulty (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The submandibular push exercise may be effective as a swallowing muscle exercise owing to its superiority in inducing selective contractions of the supra- and infrahyoid muscles. The CTAR and Shaker exercises are also effective in this regard."
