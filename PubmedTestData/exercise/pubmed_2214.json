        "Sex differences in resting cerebral hemodynamics decline with aging. Given that acute resistance exercise (RE) is a hypertensive challenge, it may reveal sex-dependent abnormalities in cerebral hemodynamics. Thus, we hypothesized that cerebral blood velocity and pulsatility responses to RE would be sex-dependent in older adults. Fourteen older females and 11 males (50-68 yr) completed a high-intensity unilateral isokinetic knee flexion/extension exercise. Measurements were collected at baseline, immediately, 5- and 30-min post-RE. Blood pressure was measured via finger photoplethysmography. Mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and pulsatility were assessed via transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Carotid pulsatility was obtained via duplex ultrasound. MCAv increased immediately after RE in older females [mean difference (<i>d</i>) = 6.02, 95% CI: 1.66 to 10.39 cm/s, <i>P</i> < 0.001] but not in males (<i>d</i> = -0.72, 95% CI: -3.83 to 5.27 cm/s, <i>P</i> = 0.99), followed by similar reductions 5-min post-RE in older females (<i>d</i> = -4.40, 95% CI: -8.81 to -0.10 cm/s, <i>P</i> = 0.045) and males (<i>d</i> = -6.41, 95% CI: -11.19 to -1.62 cm/s, <i>P</i> = 0.003). MCAv pulsatility increased similarly in older females (<i>d</i> = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.40, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and males (<i>d</i> = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.53, <i>P</i> < 0.001), persisting 5-min post-RE. Older females showed smaller increases in carotid pulsatility immediately after RE (<i>d</i> = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.38, <i>P</i> = 0.01) than males (<i>d</i> = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.68, <i>P</i> < 0.001). An exercise-mediated hypertensive stimulus revealed differential sex responses in MCAv and carotid pulsatility but not in cerebral pulsatility. Cerebral pulsatility findings suggest a similar sex susceptibility to cerebrovascular abnormalities following exercise-mediated hypertensive stimulus in older adults.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Sex differences in resting cerebral hemodynamics decline with advancing age as females experience larger reductions in cerebral blood velocity and steeper pulsatility increases than males. However, an exercise-mediated hypertensive stimulus might reveal sex differences in cerebral hemodynamics not apparent at rest. Following high-intensity resistance exercise, older females but not males exhibit increases in cerebral blood velocity, despite similar increases in cerebral pulsatility. The susceptibility to cerebrovascular abnormalities following exercise-mediated hypertensive stimulus appears similar between sexes."
