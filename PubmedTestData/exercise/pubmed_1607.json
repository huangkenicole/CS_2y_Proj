        "A previous study investigated the effects of a well-documented COPD exercise protocol in lung cancer patients. The study showed improvements in physical fitness, but poor adherence to continued exercise after intervention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a modified exercise intervention on post-intervention adherence, and physical fitness in a broad group of lung cancer patients.",
        "Fifty-nine patients enrolled in a 9-week exercise program. Eligibility criteria were limited to presence of motivation, and absence of comorbidities that could jeopardize safety. The intervention included three times 3 weeks of exercise (3 weeks supervised, 3 weeks home-based and 3 weeks supervised). The patient's activities were structured by logbooks during the 3 weeks at home. VO2 max was estimated at baseline and at the end of intervention. Self-reported quality of life was recorded before and after the exercise program. Post-intervention exercise activity was assessed by telephone interviews 4 weeks after intervention.",
        "Fifty-one patients initiated the exercise intervention and 29 patients successfully completed the exercise program. Full data were available for 25 patients regarding estimated VO2 max. Twenty-six of the 29 were available for follow-up with respect to continuance of physical activity. Among the 26 who completed the 9-week training program, 18 (69 %) continued to be physically active on a daily basis. No change in estimated VO2 max was observed. A trend towards increased quality of life and better symptom control was noted.",
        "The present study showed an increased level of continuance of physical activity compared to the previous study. The present study could, however, not repeat the significant improvements in estimated VO2 max from the previous study."
