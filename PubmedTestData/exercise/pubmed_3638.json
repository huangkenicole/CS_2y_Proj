        "Lower metabolic and cardiocirculatory reactions to eccentric compared to concentric exercise are known for large muscle groups. The extent of exercise reaction depends on the muscle mass involved and moreover differs between the various muscle groups, while it is unclear to which extent cardiovascular and metabolic reactions and differences between the types of work exist in the shoulder, also it is not known whether these reactions differ according to training status. Lactate production (LA), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) were examined following eccentric and concentric shoulder movements in 16 male gymnasts (GN) and 15 male untrained subjects (US). Differentiation was made according to the types of work for peak torque (PT) and local muscle endurance (LME). Following eccentric exercise, the increase of LA and HR was clearly lower than following concentric exercise (p<0.05). No difference was observed between the groups. Diastolic BP showed no changes, whereas systolic BP was higher following concentric exercise. Eccentric PT was higher than concentric PT in GN within a test-retest variability of 15%. LME showed a lower degree of fatigue under eccentric conditions, independent of the group. It is concluded that eccentric exercise of the shoulder leads to lower metabolic and cardiocirculatory reactions than concentric exercise, in spite of higher peak torque and less fatigue. Exercises consisting of a high proportion of eccentric movement may thus be beneficial in the therapy of shoulder complaints, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease."
