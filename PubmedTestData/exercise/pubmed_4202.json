        "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition with a growing impact on global health services. Patients with COPD frequently complain of dyspnoea and leg fatigue on exertion. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an established intervention for the management of patients with COPD. There is clear evidence for the benefit in this population. The purpose of this article is to describe the assessment process, exercise intervention and its anticipated benefits, in the context of a rehabilitation programme for individuals with COPD. This has been sub-divided into aerobic, skeletal muscle resistance and inspiratory muscle rationale, assessment and training. The evidence supporting the incorporation of aerobic and skeletal muscle resistance training in PR is well established. The benefit of including inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as an adjunct to PR is less clear."
