        "Fibromyalgia and related syndromes are characterized by chronic pain and fatigue. This chapter identifies the types of exercise that are effective for these patients and provides recommendations for exercise prescriptions. Based on a systematic review of randomized controlled studies of exercise, we suggest that low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking, can improve function and symptoms. Aerobic exercise performed twice a week at moderate intensity can improve aerobic capacity and reduce tenderness. Pool exercise can improve function, distress and symptoms. Strength training at adequate load can improve strength without exacerbation of symptoms. Most patients tolerate low-intensity exercise. High-intensity exercise should be undertaken with caution. Due to the large variability of functioning and symptom severity in patient populations, exercise prescriptions should be individualized and should include a long-term plan to maximize functioning and wellbeing. Studies with larger populations, allowing subgroup analyses regarding benefits and adverse effects of programmes, are needed."
