        "Evidence would suggest that regardless of disease status, people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS can obtain similar health benefits from routine physical activity reported within general populations. Research has shown significant improvements among psychological and physiologic variables within the first 5 to 6\u00a0weeks of beginning a routine physical activity program. Daily activity has shown promising results in other clinical populations, but there is still a paucity of research that limits evidence among the HIV population. Additional research is needed to examine the long-term benefits of physical activity, and to discover more practical ways to achieve this lifestyle change."
