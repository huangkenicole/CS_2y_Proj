        "The aim of this study is to explore the current literature examining the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of exercise interventions for individuals with myeloid leukemia.",
        "A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, AMED, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science using the terms \"exercise\" OR \"physical activity\" AND \"myeloid leukemia.\" Two reviewers performed duplicate title/abstract and full text screening of clinical trials comparing outcomes for people with myeloid leukemia participating in an exercise program. Initial searches yielded 149 articles. Two reviewers independently extracted data using piloted forms and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's tool. Data was extracted in relation to the study population, study intervention, comparator intervention, and outcomes assessed.",
        "Five trials were included in this review after 20 full-text articles were screened. Risk of bias was determined to be high in all five studies. Adherence rates were found to be low (<30 %) in all studies measuring this outcome. Positive improvements were found for fatigue, physical functioning, quality of life, and psychological distress for patients with AML; however, not all findings were significant. Leukocyte and BCR-ABL1 levels increased significantly post-exercise for participants with CML. Only one adverse event was reported.",
        "Exercise interventions appear safe and feasible for individuals with AML. Not enough evidence was presented to comment on the feasibility of exercise programs for individuals with CML. Inconclusive evidence was found on the effectiveness of exercise to minimize side effects for participants with AML."
