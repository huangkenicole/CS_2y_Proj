        "In peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients with intermittent claudication (IC), the combination of aerobic and resistance exercises could counteract muscle loss and attenuate disease progression. This study analyzed the effects of six months of a combined exercise program on walking ability, lower limb body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI).",
        "Twenty-three patients (age 63.2\u00b11.5 years and ABI 0.58\u00b10.07) with PAD and IC were allocated to a control group (CG) or a supervised exercise group (SUP). Ten patients underwent six months of treadmill walking combined with resistance exercises, three times a week. The CG (N.=13) received a recommendation for walking. All patients were measured at baseline (M0), after three months (M3), and six months (M6).",
        "During constant treadmill protocol, the claudication onset time/distance (COT/COD), absolute claudication time/distance (ACT/ACD), and number of pauses of overall patients significantly improved at M3 and M6. Between groups were found significant differences in COT and COD at M6 (P=0.005 and P=0.007, respectively); and in ACT and ACD at M3 (P=0.003 for both) and at M6 (P=0.005 and P=0.005, respectively), with major improvements in the SUP. Over the six months, a significant group effect was found in fat-free mass (P=0.041) and predicted muscle mass (P=0.039) of the lower ABI leg, with greater improvements in the SUP.",
        "A supervised exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training improves PAD symptoms and has additional benefits for patients. Patients in the program showed improvements in walking ability, lower-limb body composition, perceived exertion, and heart rate during treadmill walking."
