        "We investigated whether nocturia in the elderly was improved by walking exercise, which involved walking rapidly for 30 min or more in the evening or night for 8 weeks. A questionnaire related to micturition and exercise, blood pressure, body composition analysis, blood biochemistry tests, and urinalysis were performed before and after 8 weeks of exercise to investigate the effects of walking. Thirty men (71 years old on average) continued the walking exercise for long enough to undergo evaluation. The number of episodes of nocturia decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from 3.3 +/- 0.7 to 1.9 +/- 0.8 after 8 weeks of walking exercise. The daytime urinary frequency, blood pressure, body weight, body fat ratio, edema ratio, serum catecholamines, triglycerides, and total cholesterol were also decreased. After 8 weeks of exercise, 20 of the subjects (67%) stated that sleep was deeper than before exercise. Assessment of the overall improvement showed that excellent or good results were obtained in 18 patients (60%). The main factor related to the influence of walking exercise on nocturia was that sleep became deeper, which increased the arousal threshold bladder volume. Walking exercise may also have a preventive effect on lifestyle-related diseases."
