        "Substantial evidence supports therapeutic exercise for improving health and function in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, few studies have considered the patients' perspective.",
        "This study explored perspectives of adults with MS following participation in a 3-month clinic- and home-based exercise rehabilitation program.",
        "Twenty participants with MS were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide on the design and implementation processes of the exercise programs as well as any perceived facilitators or barriers to exercise. Data analysis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach to generate themes from the transcribed interviews.",
        "Key facilitators of exercise for people with MS included perceived improvements in physical health and function, activity participation, and psychosocial health. Mismatched level of exercise with their stage of post-diagnosis and/or functional ability and limited human interaction emerged as barriers to exercise.",
        "Participation in the exercise program was a positive experience for people with MS. Despite the provision of a high level of adaptation and tailored exercise plan and delivery, self-directed exercise continued to present challenges for people with MS. Additionally, the importance of seeking cost-effective ways to maintain motivational support was implicit in participant responses. The findings provided an improved understanding of personal experiences and exercise perspectives that can inform future intervention strategies aimed at promoting sustained exercise participation."
