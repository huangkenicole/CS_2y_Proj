      "AbstractText": [
        "Children with brain tumors (BTs) experience fatigue and decreased quality of life (QOL). Physical activity (PA) is recommended during and after cancer treatment. We explored whether a fitness tracker intervention combined with tailored coaching by a physical therapist (PT) increased PA and QOL and decreased fatigue in children with BTs.",
        "Participants were 7 to 18 years' old, within 2 years of diagnosis, and received a 12-week PA intervention using a fitness tracker combined with 5 PT coaching sessions. Steps/day measured by Fitbit and self-reports of QOL, fatigue, and PA were evaluated at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.",
        "Participants had nonsignificant increase in steps/day. Total fatigue, general, and sleep/rest subscales improved while cognitive fatigue and QOL remained unchanged. Higher steps/day were associated with lower fatigue.",
        "This is a feasible intervention that may contribute to an increase in PA and improve fatigue in children with BTs."
