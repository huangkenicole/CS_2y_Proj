      "AbstractText": [
        "This randomized controlled superiority trial will determine if an 18-month telehealth walking exercise self-management program produces clinically meaningful changes in walking exercise sustainability compared to attention-control education for veterans living with lower-limb amputation.",
        "Seventy-eight participants with lower-limb amputation (traumatic or nontraumatic) aged 50 to 89\u00a0years will be enrolled. Two groups will complete 6 one-on-one intervention sessions, and 6 group sessions over an 18-month intervention period. The experimental arm will receive a self-management program focusing on increasing walking exercise and the control group will receive attention-control education specific to healthy aging. Daily walking step count (primary outcome) will be continuously monitored using an accelerometer over the 18-month study period. Secondary outcomes are designed to assess potential translation of the walking exercise intervention into conventional amputation care across the Veteran Affairs Amputation System of Care. These secondary outcomes include measures of intervention reach, efficacy, likelihood of clinical adoption, potential for clinical implementation, and ability of participants to maintain long-term exercise behavior.",
        "The unique rehabilitation paradigm used in this study addresses the problem of chronic sedentary lifestyles following lower-limb amputation through a telehealth home-based walking exercise self-management model. The approach includes 18\u00a0months of exercise support from clinicians and peers. Trial results will provide rehabilitation knowledge necessary for implementing clinical translation of self-management interventions to sustain walking exercise for veterans living with lower-limb amputation, resulting in a healthier lifestyle."
