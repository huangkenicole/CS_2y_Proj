        "Investigate the impact of 12-weeks' moderate-intensity resistance training on psychological parameters in ambulatory adults with Facioscapulohumeral, Becker, and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.",
        "Seventeen adults with Facioscapulohumeral (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096), Limb-girdle (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096; types 2A, 2B, 2L, and 2I), or Becker (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20095) muscular dystrophy took part. Participants were tested at baseline (PRE), after a 12-week control period (PRE2), and after a 12-week supervised resistance training programme (POST). Training included multi-joint and single-joint resistance exercises. Outcomes from self-report questionnaires were health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, self-esteem, and physical self-worth.",
        "No difference in outcome measures, except depressive symptoms, was found in the control period (PRE to PRE2). Symptoms of depression were reduced by 9% from PRE to PRE2 (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) and by a further 19% from PRE2 to POST (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Other changes from PRE2 to POST were that trait anxiety reduced by 10%, self-esteem increased by 10%, physical self-worth increased by 20%, and quality of life improved in 8 domains (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "These findings demonstrate the positive impact of moderate-intensity resistance training on psychological health and quality of life in adults with Facioscapulohumeral, Becker, and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies.Implications for rehabilitationResistance training can have a positive impact on psychological health and quality of life in adults with Facioscapulohumeral, Becker, and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.Healthcare professionals should consider including moderate-intensity resistance training within the management and treatment programmes of adults with Facioscapulohumeral, Becker, and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy."
