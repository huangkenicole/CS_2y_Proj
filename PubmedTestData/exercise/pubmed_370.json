        "Currently, several strength training protocols have been verified aiming improvements on functionality in older population. For this purpose, integrated exercises aimed at improving essential movements may be an interesting strategy in improving performance for daily activities. This randomized trial compared the effects of eight and twelve weeks of functional and traditional training (TT) on joint mobility, gait determinants and muscle strength, and verified the maintenance of the effects after eight weeks of detraining in the older women.",
        "Fifty-two older women were randomized into three groups: Functional Training (FT: N.=19), TT (TT: N.=16) and Stretching Group (SG: N.=17). The data were analyzed by ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test.",
        "The FT and TT groups obtained significant improvements in the tests of muscle strength and muscle power both after twelve weeks of intervention, as well as with SG. Only the FT presented statistically significant improvements in dynamic agility/balance (32%, P=0.000), and cardiorespiratory condition (8.71%, P=0.020) in relation to SG.",
        "The experimental protocols are equally effective in improving joint mobility and strength components in active older women. However, FT seems to be more effective than TT in the improvement of the determinants of gait ability."
