        "The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of home-based exercises (HBE) in alleviating pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety and enhancing the quality of life (QOL) among adults with fibromyalgia. A comprehensive search was conducted across four databases PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL (EBSCO), and PEDro to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) at a 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. Ten RCTs met the inclusion criteria, involving 601 participants, with a good-to-fair quality according to the PEDro scale. Of the 10 included studies, 3 compared HBE to no exercise, while 7 compared HBE to center-based exercises (CBE). HBE showed significant pain reduction (SMD = 0.775, P = 0.003) and improved QOL as measured by the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) (SMD = 0.621, P = 0.001) compared with no exercise, but there were no significant differences in depression and QOL as measured by SF-36 compared with CBE. In contrast, CBE demonstrated greater pain reduction (SMD = -1.325, P < 0.001) and improved FIQ scores (SMD = -0.843, P = 0.017) compared with HBE. In conclusion, HBE exhibit effectiveness in alleviating pain, and depression and enhancing QOL among fibromyalgia patients in comparison to no exercise. However, CBE are more effective in reducing pain and enhancing QOL than HBE, although HBE can be valuable for maintaining activity levels in fibromyalgia patients between treatment cycles."
