        "Frailty is a common and clinically significant condition in older adults, predominantly due to its association with adverse health outcomes such as hospitalisation, disability and mortality. Exercise interventions have been shown to be a beneficial treatment for frailty. However, more high-quality studies are needed to assess the feasibility and impact of these interventions in frail geriatric populations within different settings, and their impact on broader aspects of health and well-being.",
        "This study will use a 2-week, interventional, independent measures research design in order to assess the feasibility and impact of two specially adapted exercise training interventions (a specially adapted resistance training intervention, and Move It Or Lose It: an established community-based exercise intervention for older adults) aimed at improving the multidimensional health and functional capacity of frail geriatric hospital inpatients.",
        "This study has received a favourable ethical opinion by the Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Research Ethics Committee and sponsorship by the University of Birmingham after review by the sponsors research governance office. The findings will be disseminated through publication in open access scientific journals, public engagement events, online via social media, conference presentations and directly to study participants on request.",
