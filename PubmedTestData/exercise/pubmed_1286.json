        "Providing accommodating resistance with the use of chains (CRT) is a programming technique that may enhance muscle size, strength, and power. However, there is a paucity of studies comparing the responses to CRT and traditional resistance training (TRT) approaches. This study aimed to examine the effects of 8 weeks of CRT and TRT on muscular adaptations in young recreationally-trained men.",
        "Thirty men (26\u00b14 y) volunteered to participate in the present study and were randomly assigned to either CRT (N.=10), TRT (N.=10), or a non-exercise control group (CG, N.=10). A resistance-training program (3-4 sets, ~8-12 repetitions at 65-80% of 1RM) was performed three times a week for 8 weeks. Percentage body fat, arm and thigh circumferences, 1RM and endurance (number of repetitions to failure 60% of 1RM) strength tests in the back squat and bench press exercises, and vertical jump power were assessed before and after the intervention.",
        "Following the intervention, both training groups demonstrated improvements in strength compared to CG, where greater gains were observed for CRT (e.g., bench press 1RM: CRT=28%; TRT=19% / back squat endurance: CRT=8%; TRT=2%).",
        "The use of chains during resistance training may promote greater gains in strength in young men."
