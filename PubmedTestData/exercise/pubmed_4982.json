        "Concussion induces the rapid onset of a short-lived neurophysiological disturbance that often results in autonomic nervous system dysfunction. This dysfunction affects both cardiovascular functioning and higher cognitive processing, inducing postconcussion clinical symptoms (somatic, cognitive, or emotional or a combination) and functional disturbances (impaired balance, cognition, and visual-vestibular performance). Current concussion rehabilitation paradigms using aerobic exercise may improve concussion symptoms. Additionally, cognitive training-focused rehabilitation interventions may enhance cognitive function postinjury. Though aerobic exercise and cognitive training-based concussion rehabilitation are successful independently, the multifaceted nature of concussion suggests the potential benefit of integrating both to improve concussion outcomes and clinician implementation. To support this clinical recommendation, we critiqued the existing research in which authors investigated aerobic exercise and cognitive training as postconcussion rehabilitation modalities, identified keys gaps in the literature, and proposed a practical clinical recommendation to integrate both modalities during concussion rehabilitation."
