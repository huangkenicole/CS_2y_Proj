        "We examined the effects of exercise on depression in older adults living in nursing homes and explored the moderator effects of participants, methods, and intervention characteristics.",
        "We searched 8 databases from inception to January 2020 without date restrictions. We retrieved primary studies measuring exercise with 60-year-olds with depression that were written in English. Two researchers independently coded each primary study and compared codes for discrepancies. They consulted a third researcher to come to consensus. We used random-effects model to compute effect sizes using Hedges' <i>g</i>, a forest plot, and <i>Q</i> and <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> statistics as measures of heterogeneity. We also examined moderator analyses.",
        "Twenty-one studies included 2,594 participants (81.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\u2009years old). Overall, exercise showed a small improvement in depression compared to controls (ES=.25; 95%CI 0.11, 0.38; <i>p</i>=.000). Interestingly, interventionists by physiotherapists had a smaller effect on depressive symptoms (.04) than other health interventionists (.37). As people aged, exercise was less effective in reducing depression (slope=-.03, Q<sub>model</sub>=5.03, <i>p</i>=.025). Researchers who included a higher percentage of women in exercise showed less improvement of depression (<i>slope</i>=-.01, Q<sub>model</sub>=8.60, <i>p</i>=.003). Also, when researchers used depression scales with higher reliability values, they measured higher levels of depression (slope = 5.48, Q<sub>model</sub>=5.60, <i>p</i>=.018). No other quality indicators moderated the effects of exercise on depression.",
