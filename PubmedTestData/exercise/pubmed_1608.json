        "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of aerobic physical activity in reducing the frequency of hepatic steatosis and metabolic and cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",
        "Forty sedentary postmenopausal women (mean age 55.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.0 y) with biopsy-proven NAFLD were randomly divided into two groups: an exercising group (19 participants) and a control group (nonexercising, 21 participants). The exercise group underwent a supervised aerobic physical activity program of 120\u200amin/wk for 24 weeks. The anthropometric parameters; body composition; hepatic, lipid, and glycemic profiles; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index; cytokines; transient elastography (FibroScan; liver stiffness/controlled attenuation parameter); and cardiopulmonary exercise test were evaluated at baseline and after 24 weeks of protocol.",
        "At baseline there were no significant differences in anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory parameters-stiffness and liver fat content by FibroScan between the groups. After 24 weeks, we observed a decrease of waist circumference, an increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P\u200a<\u200a0.05), and improved cardiopulmonary functional capacity in the exercise group. In addition, the controlled attenuation parameter analysis showed no significant decrease of hepatic steatosis in the exercise group. With regard to the systemic inflammation, there were, however, no significant differences in the cytokines between the groups.",
        "An aerobic physical activity program of 24 weeks in NAFLD postmenopausal women showed improvement in some variables such as waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and cardiopulmonary performance that may be beneficial in improving cardiovascular risk factors in this population."
