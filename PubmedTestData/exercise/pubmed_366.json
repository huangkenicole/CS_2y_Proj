        "This study aimed to determine the effects of either aerobic training (AT) or resistance training (RT) or both (A+RT) on obesity and its comorbidities in young adults. A total of 61\u00a0participants, aged 21.74 \u00b1 1.42 years and with a body mass (BM) index (BMI) of 36.21 \u00b1 2.43 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were randomized for 12 weeks into control (CONT, <i>n</i> = 15), AT (<i>n</i> = 15), RT (<i>n</i> = 16), and A+RT (<i>n</i> = 15) groups. BM, body composition, and cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed before and after intervention. BM did not change in the CONT and RT groups but decreased significantly by 7.5 kg in the AT (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.05) and 8.82 kg in the A+RT (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.05) groups, respectively. Significant reductions were also noted in waist circumference, BMI, and body fat percentage in the exercising groups. The most significant variations were in the A+RT group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were increased after A+RT by 2.39 mg/dL. Significant reductions were also noted in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) concentrations (-2.84 mg/dL) in the A+RT group. AT alone is effective in improving BM and body composition, while RT alone improves the body composition and A+RT ensures better outcomes concerning BM, body composition, HDL-C, and VLDL-C. <b>Novelty:</b> Aerobic training alone is effective in improving BM and body composition. Resistance training alone improves the body composition. The combination of aerobic and resistance exercises ensures better outcomes for BM, body composition, HDL-C, and VLDL-C."
