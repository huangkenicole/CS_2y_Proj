      "AbstractText": [
        "Guidelines recommend exercise for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), however adherence to guidelines is low. A paucity of data examining factors associated with objectively-measured exercise post-discharge in ACS survivors exists. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with exercise during the 5\u202fweeks after ACS discharge.",
        "A sample of 151 ACS patients treated at a university hospital were enrolled into an observational cohort study and wore an accelerometer for 35\u202fdays post-discharge. Days on which participants accumulated \u226530\u202fmin of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in bouts \u226510\u202fmin were considered exercise days. Participants were categorized as non-exercisers (0 exercise days) or exercisers (\u22651 exercise day). A multi-variable logistic regression model was used to examine the association between exercise and socio-demographics, depression, SF-12 physical and mental health scores, disease severity, length of hospitalization, and percutaneous coronary intervention.",
        "39.7% of participants were non-exercisers. Factors associated with non-exercise were age (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.06-1.17, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), female sex (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.10-6.95, p\u202f=\u202f0.031), and lower SF-12 physical health score (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90-0.98, p\u202f=\u202f0.005).",
        "In ACS patients in whom exercise participation was objectively measured for 5\u202fweeks post-discharge, demographic and poor physical health factors were associated with non-exercise. These findings identify populations (e.g. older adults, women) at especially high risk for being physically inactive in whom more intense intervention may be warranted."
