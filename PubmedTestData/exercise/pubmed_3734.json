        "The assessment of affective responses (pleasure-displeasure) to exercise, is a useful tool for tailoring exercise prescription. Ideally, the proper prescription is a balance between minimizing risks, such as negative affect and dropout, and maximizing gains, such as improvements in health and fitness. Measuring affective responses to exercise facilitates the process of self-regulation. When individuals have the autonomy to select the exercise intensity, they are more likely to have a positive exercise experience and adhere to the program. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has put forth guidelines on how to incorporate affective responses within exercise prescription. The primary purpose of this review is to expand upon the techniques and recommendations provided by the ACSM on the topic of affective responses. Topics include an overview of the existing research of affective responses to exercise intensity, the impact of affective responses on motivation and exercise behaviors, and recommendations of specific techniques for measuring, monitoring, and evaluating affective responses within an exercise prescription."
