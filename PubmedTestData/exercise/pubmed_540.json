        "Supervised group exercise (SGE) is recommended for people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Recent literature suggests that its contents and dosage must probably be revised. As a first step towards renewal, this study examined the current SGE organisation and content for people with axSpA in The Netherlands. A pen-and-paper survey was sent to the boards of the 82 local patient associations affiliated with the Dutch Arthritis Society in 2016. One member of each board was asked to complete questions on the nature and organisation of SGE and one of the supervising therapists to complete questions on the SGE supervision and contents. The questionnaire was returned by representatives of 67/82 (82%) local patient associations, of which 17 (25%) provided axSpA-specific SGE (16/17 SGE programmes with both land-based exercise and hydrotherapy and 1/17 with only hydrotherapy). These involved in total 56 groups with 684 participants and 59 supervisors, of whom 54 were physical therapists and 21 had had postgraduate education on rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Besides mobility and strengthening exercises and sports (17/17), most programmes included aerobic exercise (10/17), but rarely with heart rate monitoring (1/17), patient education (8/17), periodic assessments (2/17), or exercise personalisation (1/17). In the Netherlands, a quarter of local patient associations organised axSpA-specific SGE, mostly containing land-based exercises combined with sports and hydrotherapy. Most supervisors lacked postgraduate education on RMDs and most programmes lacked intensity monitoring, patient education, periodic assessments, and personalisation, which are needed for optimising exercise programmes according to current scientific insights."
