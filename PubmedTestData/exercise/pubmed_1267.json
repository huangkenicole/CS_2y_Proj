        "The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a staff-delivered physical exercise program embedded into the daily lives of older adults living in nursing homes. A randomized controlled pilot feasibility study was carried out, which included quantitative, qualitative, and economic assessments at baseline, 12\u00a0weeks, and 12\u00a0months. Two nursing homes (one intervention and one control) took part. The exercise program was carried out on 3\u00a0days per week for 12\u00a0weeks and consisted of a program of Morning Movement (walking and sit-to-stand exercises) and Activity Bursts. The results confirm that the intervention and study processes are largely acceptable and feasible to implement in the nursing home setting. Potential short-term improvements in physical mobility and quality of life were noticed as positive mean changes and supported by qualitative assessment. Future randomized controlled trials should consider using the 6-meter walk test and refining nursing home and participant eligibility criteria."
