        "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Balance is a strong indicator of physical development of adolescents, and there is a trend of employing exergame for balance training. However, the effectiveness of exergame specifically designed for balance training on adolescents' balance abilities in various postures remains unclear. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> In this study, an exergame for balance training was developed with Kinect and a randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess its effect on balance ability development. Thirty-two healthy adolescents (age: 11.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.51) were recruited to participate in an 8-week trial and randomly allocated to an exergame group (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200916) or control group (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200916). <b><i>Results:</i></b> The static balance test in the eagle stance posture and the dynamic balance test using the Y-Balance Test were both conducted before and after the intervention. From the results of Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, the intervention group presented greater improvement during the eagle stance test with eyes closed than the control group with <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.009 and <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.03 in left and right leg, respectively. The intervention group also showed a more significant improvement in dynamic balance (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.002), which was reflected by the higher increase of composite scores. Furthermore, the balance ability when standing with nondominant leg or eyes closed, both presented higher improvements than standing with dominant leg or eyes opened, respectively. Moreover, 75% participants reported high interest and 87.5% participants expressed high engagement with exergame (score \u22654) using 5-score scale questionnaire. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The proposed exergame for balance training could potentially promote balance training and serve as an educational tool for healthy adolescents to enhance their balance abilities."
