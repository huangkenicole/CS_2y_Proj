        "This study had two objectives: <i>1</i>) to compare the effects of 3 wk of resistance training (RT) and resistance training with instability (RTI) on evoked reflex responses at rest and during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and <i>2</i>) to determine the effectiveness of RT and RTI in moving values of evoked reflex responses of individuals with PD toward values of age-matched healthy control subjects (HCs) (<i>z</i>-score analysis). Ten individuals in the RT group and 10 in the RTI group performed resistance exercises twice a week for 3 wk, but only the RTI group included unstable devices. The HC group (<i>n</i> = 10) were assessed at pretest only. Evoked reflex responses at rest (H reflex and M wave) and during MVIC [supramaximal M-wave amplitude (M<sub>sup</sub>) and supramaximal V-wave amplitude (V<sub>sup</sub>)] of the plantar flexors were assessed before and after the experimental protocol. From pretraining to posttraining, only RTI increased ratio of maximal H-reflex amplitude to maximal M-wave amplitude at rest (H<sub>max</sub>/M<sub>max</sub>), M<sub>sup</sub>, V<sub>sup</sub>/M<sub>sup</sub>, and peak torque of the plantar flexors (<i>P</i> < 0.05). At posttraining, RTI was more effective than RT in increasing resting H<sub>max</sub> and V<sub>sup</sub> and in moving these values to those observed in HCs (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We conclude that short-term RTI is more effective than short-term RT in modulating H-reflex excitability and in increasing efferent neural drive, approaching average values of HCs. Thus short-term RTI may cause positive changes at the spinal and supraspinal levels in individuals with PD. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Maximal H-reflex amplitude (H<sub>max</sub>) at rest and efferent neural drive [i.e., supramaximal V-wave amplitude (V<sub>sup</sub>)] to skeletal muscles during maximal contraction are impaired in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Short-term resistance training with instability was more effective than short-term resistance training alone in increasing H<sub>max</sub> and V<sub>sup</sub> of individuals with Parkinson's disease, reaching the average values of healthy control subjects."
