        "The aim of this study was to use the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure among adult women.",
        "Studies were retrieved from computer searches (MEDLINE, Sport Discus, Current Contents) and bibliographies of retrieved articles were cross-referenced. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized trials, (2) aerobic activity as the primary exercise intervention, (3) comparative nonexercise control group included, (4) changes in resting systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure assessed for women ages 18 and older, and (5) studies published in English-language journals between January 1966 and January 1998. The primary outcomes retrieved in this study were changes in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure calculated as the difference (exercise minus control) of the changes (initial minus final) in these mean values.",
        "Ten studies representing 732 subjects and 36 primary outcomes (19 systolic, 17 diastolic) met the criteria for inclusion. Overall, an approximate 2% decrease in resting systolic and 1% decrease in resting diastolic blood pressure were observed (systolic,;x +/- SD = -2 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, 95% bootstrap confidence interval -3 to -1 mm Hg; diastolic,;x +/- SD = -1 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, 95% bootstrap confidence interval -2 to -1 mm Hg).",
        "Aerobic exercise results in small reductions in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure among adult women. However, a need exists for additional, well-designed studies on this topic, especially among hypertensive adult women."
