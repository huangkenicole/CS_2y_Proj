        "This systematic review aimed to demonstrate the benefits of dance-based therapeutic interventions in rehabilitation processes in patients with neurological disorders.",
        "Searches on the following databases and electronic search engines were conducted: MEDLINE, LILACS, Science Direct, SCOPUS, PeDro, BVS (virtual health library), and Google Scholar. Data extraction was independently performed by two authors. Twenty-five clinical trial-type studies that included dance and established outcome measures were included, and studies in which a musicalized exercise modality was used without the connotation of dance were excluded.",
        "From the results of multiple studies, the short-term motor benefits of rhythmic auditory stimulation on gait parameters were highlighted. Furthermore, there was scientific evidence demonstrating the benefits of the cognitive and social parameters of group dancing as significant improvements in cognitive flexibility and processing speed were highlighted. Recent studies showed that interventions based on exercise and/or rhythmic choreography can reduce the risk of falls in patients with neurological disorders, thereby improving their quality of life.",
        "These findings suggest that dance is an innovative and effective method that can be included in therapies as it allows for a promising prognosis in motor, cognitive, and social performances of patients with neurological disorders that alter mobility and quality of life."
