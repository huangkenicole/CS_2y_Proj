        "Systematically review the effect of exercise and motor interventions on physical activity and motor outcomes of adults with cerebral palsy (CP).",
        "Eight databases were searched.",
        "Twenty-five studies were included, representing 439 adults with CP. Very low to low quality evidence supports that gait training is more effective than standard care or neurodevelopmental treatment for improving gait velocity, quality of gait, and ankle stiffness; balance training is more effective than seated therapeutic activities for improving walking self-confidence and perceived change in balance; whole-body vibration is no more effective than resistance training for improving strength or gait function; and resistance training is no more effective than a person's typical exercise program for improving strength or gait function of adults with CP. Adverse events were reported for balance training, functional training, resistance training, and whole-body vibration.",
        "Further research is needed that is adequately powered and uses well-controlled study designs."
