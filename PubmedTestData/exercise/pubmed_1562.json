        "chair-based pedal exercises potentially offer a simple method of improving physical activity in older people admitted to hospital.",
        "to assess the feasibility of using chair-based pedal exercisers on acute medical wards for older people. To study if there is any effect on muscle strength, mobility and time spent physically active.",
        "fifty participants \u226565 years who were able to pedal admitted to acute medical wards for older people in a UK hospital.",
        "participants were randomised to either pedal for 5 min three times a day with minimal supervision; or standard care. Outcome data (compliance with exercise and change in lower limb muscle strength, mobility and level of physical activity) were collected on day 7 or on discharge, whichever came 1st.",
        "there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention and standard care group. Participants remained in the study for an average of 5 days. None in the intervention group adhered to the prescribed exercise duration. The intervention group completed a median of 152 revolutions, or a median total pedal time of 5 min during the entire study period. There were no differences in change in lower limb muscle strength, mobility score or the percentage of time spent active between the two groups.",
        "pedal exercises with minimal supervision are not feasible as a single intervention to improve physical activity in older people admitted to hospital. There may be a role for it as part of a multifaceted strategy to improve physical activity in hospital."
