        "Thirty-eight studies were included. Fifty-one resistance exercises were extracted and categorized as isometric exercises (n = 20), heel raises (n = 6), strengthening with external resistance (n = 13), or unspecified (n = 12). A median of 8 (interquartile range, 6-10) of a possible 19 CERT items was reported. The amount of items described of the 13 Toigo and and Boutellier exercise descriptors ranged from 0 to 11.",

However, most studies provided inadequate description of resistance exercise interventions. <i>J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(12):681-691. Epub 23 Oct 2020. doi:10.2519/jospt.2020.9463</i>."
