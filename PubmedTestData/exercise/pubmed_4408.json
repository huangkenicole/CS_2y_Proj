      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Objective</i>: To present the extent of evidence concerning the effectiveness of extended reality telerehabilitation and patients' experiences of using different types of virtual reality exercises at home. <i>Methods</i>: We included studies on virtual reality and augmented reality telerehabilitation published in English. Systematic searches were undertaken in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PEDro, with no date limitations. We included only RCTs and qualitative studies exploring patients' experiences. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool for quantitative papers and the CASP scale for qualitative studies. All results are presented narratively. <i>Results</i>: Thirteen studies, nine quantitative and four qualitative, were included, with one qualitative and seven quantitative having a high risk of bias. All studies reported that extended reality-based telerehabilitation may be effective compared to conventional exercises or other extended reality exercises. Seven quantitative studies focused on upper limb function. Qualitative papers suggested that VR exercises were perceived as feasible by patients. <i>Conclusions</i>: The literature suggests VR home exercises are feasible and potentially effective for patients after a stroke in the upper limb. Further high-quality studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of XR exercises early adoption on different qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Registration number: (CRD42022384356)."
