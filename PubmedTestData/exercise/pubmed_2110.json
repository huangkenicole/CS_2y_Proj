        "This study evaluated changes in deep trunk muscle thickness and lower extremity muscle activities during bridge exercises with the abdominal drawing-in maneuver. Bridge exercises were conducted on an unstable surface at different knee flexion angles (60\u00ba, 90\u00ba and 120\u00ba), with the aim of identifying more effective angles for bridge exercises. This study included 21 healthy adults, aged 20-27 years. Biceps femoris (BF), rectus abdominis, and rectus femoris activity was measured using surface electromyography. The thicknesses of the transverse abdominis (TrA), external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO) muscles were measured. BF (<i>p</i> = 0.000, partial \u03b72 = 0.670) activity increased considerably as the knee flexion angle decreased. TrA (<i>p</i> = 0.000, partial \u03b72 = 0.883) and IO (<i>p</i> = 0.000, partial \u03b72 = 0.892) thickness significantly increased, while EO (<i>p</i> = 0.000, partial \u03b72 = 0.893) thickness decreased as the knee flexion angle decreased. When performing bridge exercises using the abdominal drawing-in maneuver on an unstable surface, the knee flexion angles should be at 120\u00ba and 60\u00ba to increase trunk stability and lower extremity muscle activity, respectively."
