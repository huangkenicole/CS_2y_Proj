        "Long-term and high-intensity work can lead to considerable discomfort in people's cervical spines.",
        "This study sought to explore the effect of mind-body exercise intervention on the cervical spine mobility of people with neck discomfort through meta-analysis.",
        "This study's researchers were searched a total of five research databases for data retrieval: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (from 1979), Web of Science (from 1950), PubMed (from 1965), Cochrane (from 1991), and EBSCO (from 1949) (Date of retrieval: March 10, 2021). Two authors independently searched literature records, scanned titles, abstracts, and full texts, collected data, and assessed materials for risk of bias. Stata14.0 software was used for the data analysis (Registration number: INPLASY202140126).",
        "Four articles were finally included with a total of 208 participants, and their age range was 18-65 years old. (1) Mind-body exercise intervention had a significant improving effect on Cervical extension, effect size of [SMD = 0.51 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.88), p <0.01; I2 = 45.2%], there was moderate heterogeneity; Mind-body exercise intervention had a significant improving effect on Cervical flexion, effect size of [SMD = 0.61 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.90), p <0.01; I2 = 5.7%], no heterogeneity; (2) Mind-body exercise intervention was no effect on the other four cervical range of motions; (3) The difference in participant's neck discomfort was the source of heterogeneity, and all results had the potential risk of publication bias.",
        "This study showed that mind-body exercise had a positive effect on the extension and flexion of people with neck discomfort. However, further research and more reliable evidence were needed to prove that mind-body exercise could be used for the treatment of neck discomfort."
