        "This study aimed to evaluate the influence of a 16-week concurrent exercise program on health-related quality of life in middle-aged women.",
        "A total of 150 middle-aged women from the FLAMENCO project (age range 45-60\u2009years) were randomized into a counseling (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200975) or an exercise (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200975) group. The exercise group followed a 16-week (3\u2009days/week, 60\u2009min/session) concurrent exercise program (aerobic\u2009+\u2009resistance training). The counseling group attended conferences on a healthy lifestyle. Participants' health-related quality of life was assessed with the EuroQol plus, a visual analog scale and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), where greater values indicate a better health-related quality of life.",
        "The visual analog scale increased by 9.0% in the exercise group, whereas it only increased by 3.5% in the counseling group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.040). The SF-36 physical function, physical role, bodily pain, vitality and emotional role increased by 5.5%, 11.3%, 10.8%, 9.6% and 8.9%, respectively, in the exercise group, whereas these only increased by 0.6%, decreased by 0.7% and increased by 1.4%, 3.8% and 0.6% in the counseling group (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "Our results suggest that a 16-week concurrent exercise program adapted for midlife women improved their health-related quality of life.",
