      "AbstractText": [
        "Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) is a sport- and growth-associated knee pathology with locally painful alterations around the tibial tuberosity apophysis. Up to 10% of adolescents are affected by OSD. Treatment is predominantly conservative. The aims of this systematic review are to comprehensively identify conservative treatment options for OSD, compare their effectiveness in selected outcomes, and describe potential research gaps.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted using CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PEDro databases. In addition, ongoing and unpublished clinical studies, dissertations, and other grey literature on OSD were searched. We also systematically retrieved review articles for extraction of treatment recommendations.",
        "Of 767 identified studies, thirteen were included, comprising only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The included studies were published from 1948 to 2019 and included 747 patients with 937 affected knees. Study quality was poor to moderate. In addition to the studies, 15 review articles were included, among which the most prevalent treatment recommendations were compiled.",
        "Certain therapeutic approaches, such as stretching, have apparent efficacy, but no RCT comparing specific exercises with sham or usual-care treatment exists. Carefully controlled studies on well-described treatment approaches are needed to establish which conservative treatment options are most effective for patients with OSD."
