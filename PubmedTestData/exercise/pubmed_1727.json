      "AbstractText": [
        "This study investigated the balance and dorsiflexion strength of older adults after eight weeks of resistance training, with the exercise velocity cadenced by the Pilates breathing technique and the volume modulated by the session duration. Forty-four older adults were divided into two groups: resistance training (TR; n = 22) and resistance training with the Pilates breathing technique cadencing all exercises (TR + P; n = 22), both during eight weeks. The total exercising volume was controlled by time of execution (50 min/session). The dorsiflexion strength and balance were assessed. The RT group showed higher dorsiflexion strength after the protocol: Right (RT = 29.1 \u00b1 7.7 vs. RT + P = 22.9 \u00b1 5.2, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Left (RT = 29.5 \u00b1 6.9 vs. RT + P = 24.0 \u00b1 5.2, <i>p</i> = 0.001). All balance parameters were improved in RT + P group compared to its own baseline: Path Length (cm) (pre = 71.0 \u00b1 14.3 vs. post = 59.7 \u00b1 14.3, <i>p</i> = 0.003); Sway Velocity (cm/s) (pre = 3.6 \u00b1 0.7; post = 2.9 \u00b1 0.7; <i>p</i> = 0.001); Sway Area (cm<sup>2</sup>) (pre = 8.9 \u00b1 5.3 vs. post = 5.7 \u00b1 2.1, <i>p</i> = 0.003); Excursion Medio Lateral (cm) (pre = 3.0 \u00b1 0.7 vs. post = 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 cm, <i>p</i> = 0.002); and Excursion AP (cm) (pre = 3.6 \u00b1 1.4 vs. post = 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 cm, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Resistance training using slower velocity movement cadenced by Pilates breathing technique produced balance improvements compared to baseline (moderate to large effect sizes), but no between-group effect was observed at the end of the protocol. The dorsiflexion strength was higher in the RT group compared to RT + P group."
