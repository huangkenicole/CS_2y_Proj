        "Physical activity has beneficial effects on somatic and mental health factors; therefore, regular exercise has preventive and therapeutic capabilities to improve neurological and mental dysfunction.",
        "In this overview of the current literature, the evidence of the effects of exercise on such disorders is summarized. Physical exercise interventions for stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, depression, psychoses, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndromes are considered in detail.",
        "Physical activity reduces the risk of suffering from stroke, dementia and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, it is negatively correlated with dysthymia and other depressive symptoms and various anxiety and pain disorders as well as headache syndromes. A therapeutic effect of systematic physical exercise was revealed for depression, some symptoms of psychosis and multiple sclerosis, addiction, eating disorders, the fibromyalgia syndrome as well as short-term interventions for anxiety disorders.",
        "The concerted integration of physical exercise into prophylactic and therapeutic interventions can lower the burden of neurological and mental diseases; however, scientific evidence is still lacking concerning the optimal duration, type, and intensity as well as potential risks of physical exercise."
