        "Previous studies have demonstrated that supervised strength training (ST) or walking training (WT) improve walking capacity in patients with claudication. However, it remains unknown whether these improvements would be sustained over a subsequent unsupervised period. This article reports the findings of a study to analyze whether the improvements in walking capacity, achieved with a supervised ST or WT, would be sustained over a subsequent unsupervised therapy period in patients with claudication. Patients were initially randomized to supervised exercise consisting of ST (n = 15) or WT (n = 15) for 12 weeks. After this period, 12 patients in each group consented to be followed for an additional 12 weeks of unsupervised therapy. Initial claudication distance (ICD) and total walking distance (TWD) were measured at baseline, after the supervised period (Week 12) and after the unsupervised period (Week 24). In comparison with baseline values, both groups similarly increased ICD and TWD at Week 12. From Week 12 to Week 24, both groups similarly decreased ICD (ST: -55 \u00b1 110 m and WT: -82 \u00b1 142 m, P =.04) and TWD (ST: -68 \u00b1 186 m and WT: -128 \u00b1 112 m, P < .01). However, in both groups, ICD (ST: +126 \u00b1 149 m and WT: +50 \u00b1 167 m, P = .01) and TWD (ST: +104 \u00b1 162 m and WT: +45 \u00b1 139 m, P =.01) at Week 24 remained greater than baseline values. The conclusion is that supervised ST or WT followed by an unsupervised therapy period similarly decreased walking capacity in patients with claudication. However, after the unsupervised period, walking capacity remained at a higher level than before the onset of the supervised exercise-training period."
