        "Exercise has been demonstrated as effective for the treatment of low back pain (LBP) in workers.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an exercise program adapted to the characteristics of the workplace is a useful supplement to general exercise recommendations in assembly line workers with chronic LBP.",
        "Workers were randomly assigned to intervention group-adapted exercises plus general exercise recommendations (n\u200a=\u200a10), and control group-general exercise recommendations (n\u200a=\u200a8). Both received 8-week exercise program through a mobile application (APP) to manage the intervention. Outcome was based on lumbar disability (Oswestry Disability Index), interference and lumbar pain intensity (Brief Pain Inventory), and kinematic parameters.",
        "Significant differences were obtained for the intervention group in the \"pain interference\" variable, in the \"mood\" and \"enjoyment\" sub-variables, as well as in \"flexion angle\" variable. For the control group, significant differences occurred in the \"pain intensity\" variable. Adapted exercise plus general recommendations seems more effective than the general recommendations for the improvement of lumbar flexion.",
        "An adapted exercise program for assembly line workers with chronic LBP could be an effective treatment. Future studies with a larger sample size and with an exhaustive control of the exercise adherence are required to confirm the findings of this pilot study."
