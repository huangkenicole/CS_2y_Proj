        "To provide a comprehensive CERT (Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template)-based description of the resistance exercise program implemented in the AGUEDA (Active Gains in brain Using Exercise During Aging) study, a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a 24-week supervised resistance exercise program on executive function and related brain structure and function in cognitively normal older adults.",
        "90 cognitively normal older adults aged 65 to 80 were randomized (1:1) to a: 1) resistance exercise group; or a 2) wait-list control group. Participants in the exercise group (n = 46) performed 180 min/week of resistance exercise (3 supervised sessions per week, 60 min/session) for 24 weeks.",
        "The exercise program consisted of a combination of upper and lower limb exercises using elastic bands and the participant's own body weight as the main resistance. The load and intensity were based on the resistance of the elastic bands (7 resistances), number of repetitions (individualized), motor complexity of exercises (3 levels), sets and rest (3 sets/60 sec rest), execution time (40-60 sec) and velocity (as fast as possible).",
        "The maximum prescribed-target intensity was 70-80% of the participants' maximum rate of perceived exertion (7-8 RPE). Heart rate, sleep quality and feeling scale were recorded during all exercise sessions. Those in the wait-list control group (n = 44) were asked to maintain their usual lifestyle. The feasibility of AGUEDA project was evaluated by retention, adherence, adverse events and cost estimation on the exercise program.",
        "This study details the exercise program of the AGUEDA trial, including well-described multi-language manuals and videos, which can be used by public health professionals, or general public who wish to implement a feasible and low-cost resistance exercise program. The AGUEDA exercise program seems to be feasible by the high retention (95.6%) and attendance rate (85.7%), very low serious adverse event (1%) and low economic cost (144.23 \u20ac /participant/24 weeks). We predict that a 24-week resistance exercise program will have positive effects on brain health in cognitively normal older adults."
