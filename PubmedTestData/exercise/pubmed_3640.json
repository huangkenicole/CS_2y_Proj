        "The study investigates the effects of synchronized tele-exercise on physical fitness level, quality of life (QoL), loneliness and mood of older people individuals who experience social isolation during the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "A randomized controlled study was performed with 30 volunteers. A synchronized online exercise protocol was applied to the study group (SG) (n\u2009=\u200915; 10 females, 5 males) (mean age 67.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u00a0years), while the control group (CG) (n\u2009=\u200915; 7 females, 8 males) (mean age 69.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u00a0years) was placed on the waiting list. Physical fitness (Senior Fitness Test Battery-SFTB), health-related QoL (Nottingham Health Profile-NHP), loneliness (Loneliness Scale for the Elderly-LSE), and mood changes (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-PANAS) were evaluated.",
        "There was a significant difference in all the subscales of SFTB (p\u2009<\u20090.05), physical activity and energy subscales, and total scores of NHP (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and PANAS positive emotional status score (p\u2009=\u20090.002) in the study group. While LSE scores worsened in the CG (p\u2009=\u20090.016), there was no significant difference in the SG (p\u2009=\u20090.162).",
        "Synchronous tele-exercise can provide improvements in the physical fitness level and can be used to maintain QoL and to improve the mood of community-dwelling older people."
