        "To analyze the impact of a home exercise training (ET) program on quality of life, motor activity (MA), dietary habit, functional and biochemical parameters, and clinical course of the disease in patients who have experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or endovascular coronary intervention (ECI).",
        "The trial included 100 patients after ECL who were randomized into 2 groups: those who had gone through Patient School (PS) and received a 6-week course of controlled ET (a study group (Group S)) and those who had gone through PS only (a control group (Group C). The patients of both groups were recommended a home ET program and, according to its implementation, they formed 2 subgroups: Subgroup A (home ET+) comprising 51 patients who had trained themselves at home) and Subgroup B (home ET-) consisting of 46 patients who had not. The follow-up lasted 1 year. Quality of life, risk factors, lifestyle and clinical parameters were assessed.",
        "As time elapsed, the patients' motivation to perform home ET; and, accordingly, the proportion of those who had trained themselves decreased in Group S to 67 and 61% and in Group C to 39 and 40% after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Among the reasons for refusal to perform home ET, disease was reported by only 5.6% of the patients (by all from Group C). The comprehensive physical rehabilitation program (RP) (controlled ET in combination with home ET) produced the best effect in raising the level of daily MA, exercise performance with a 21.3-fold increase in cardiac performance (p < 0.05) and a 14.3-fold decrease in heart rate increment in response to exercises. Group C patients who had refused the home ET program, as compared to those in the same group who had trained themselves at home, showed the worst daily MA levels, none body mass index reduction, and a rise in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 20.3%; p < 0.05) and in the number of angina attacks (by 1.9 times; p < 0.05).",
        "RP in the early-stage, which encompasses an educational program (PS), a short-term course of controlled ET and home ET used in patients with ACS, including in those after ECI, has clear clinical benefits. The participation of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in the home ET programs increases their motivation and, hence, the proportion of those who participate in therapeutic and rehabilitation measures. Home patient physical rehabilitation is one of the important components of different rehabilitation and prevention programs in patients with CHD after ACS and ECI."
