        "A 12-week training protocol increased antioxidant defense system in young adult women with metabolic syndrome. It is generally accepted that oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that stress may be acting as a therapeutic target in metabolic syndrome. Consequently, this study was designed to explore whether aerobic training may increase plasmatic total antioxidant status in women with metabolic syndrome. A total of 100 young adult women with metabolic syndrome according to the criteria reported by the National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult-Treatment-Panel-III) volunteered for this study. Of them, 60 were randomly included in the experimental group to enter a 12-week aerobic training program, 5 days/week, at low/moderate intensity. The control group included 40 age, sex and body mass index (BMI)-matched women with metabolic syndrome who did not enter any training program. Total antioxidant status (TAS) was assayed in plasma using colorimetric Randox kits. This protocol was approved by an Institutional Ethics Committee. When compared to baseline, plasmatic TAS was significantly increased (0.79 \u00b1 0.05 Vs 1.01 \u00b1 0.03 mmol/l; p = 0.027). No changes were found in controls. A 12-week aerobic training program increased plasmatic TAS in adult women with metabolic syndrome. Further long-term well-conducted studies are required in order to highlight the potential clinical benefits of TAS improvement."
