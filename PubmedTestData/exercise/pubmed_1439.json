      "AbstractText": [
        "One form of abnormal scapular alignment is scapular downward rotation (SDR). Changes in muscle function in SDR have not been clearly identified, and SDR exercises also require investigation. Although a diagonal pattern of exercise is commonly used as part of the exercise protocol, a direct comparison of shoulder and scapular diagonal exercises has not yet been conducted. The objectives of this study were to determine the altered activation of the scapular musculature in the SDR group and to investigate which diagonal pattern of exercise effectively activates the scapular musculature.",
        "Thirty-two participants (18 in the control group and 14 in the SDR group) volunteered to participate in this study. Electromyographic signals were collected from four muscles, the upper trapezius (UT), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), and anterior deltoid (AD), during standing performance of diagonal shoulder and scapular exercises.",
        "The control group showed significantly lower UT activity, UT/LT ratio, and UT/SA values than the SDR group (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Activation of the AD was significantly higher in the SDR than in the control group (p\u202f<\u202f.05). SA and AD activation were significantly higher in shoulder diagonal pattern exercises than in scapular diagonal pattern exercises (p\u202f<\u202f.05). The scapular posterior elevation pattern exercise showed significantly higher UT and LT activities than anterior elevation and shoulder diagonal pattern exercises (p\u202f<\u202f.05).",
        "Our findings suggest that reduced activation of the UT could lead to greater activation in the AD in SDR. Scapular posterior elevation exercise is advantageous as selectively activates the trapezius musculature, and shoulder diagonal pattern exercise is advantageous in activating the SA and AD."
