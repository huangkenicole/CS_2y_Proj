        "This randomized, controlled study investigated the physiological effects of a specially designed 12 week programme of isolated conditioning of peripheral skeletal muscle groups. The programme required minimal infrastructure in order to allow continued rehabilitation at home after familiarization within hospital. Forty eight patients, aged 40-72 yrs with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 61 (27)% of predicted normal) were randomly allocated into training (n = 32) and control (n = 16) groups. Physiological assessments were performed before and after the 12 week study period, and included peripheral muscle endurance and strength, whole body endurance, maximal exercise capacity (maximum oxygen consumption (V'O2,max)) and lung function. The training group showed significant improvement in a variety of measures of upper and lower peripheral muscle performance, with no additional breathlessness. Whole body endurance measured by free arm treadmill walking increased by 6,372 (3,932-8,812) 3 (p < 0.001). Symptom-limited maximal V'O2 was unchanged. However, the training group showed a reduction in ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide, both at peak exercise and at equivalent work rate (Wmax). In summary, low intensity isolated peripheral muscle conditioning is well-tolerated, simple and easy to perform at home. The various physiological benefits should enable patients across the range of severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to improve daily functioning."
