        "Muscle power has been reported to be critical in counteracting age-related declines in functional performance. Muscle power output in functional performance exercises can be greatly improved in a short period of time (i.e.,\u2009\u2264\u200912\u00a0weeks) using specific exercise interventions such as power training (i.e., exercises attempting to move loads ranging from 20 to 70% of 1-repetition maximum as fast as possible during the concentric muscle action, followed by a controlled, slower eccentric muscle action). Despite the widespread evidence on the effectiveness of power training in older adults (~\u2009300 scientific articles published on this topic in the past 10\u00a0years), some scientists do not recommend the use of explosive-type muscular contractions during resistance training (i.e., power training) for the older population; indeed, some international guidelines do not mention this type of exercise for older people. The reasons underlying this absence of mention and recommendation for the use of power training as a fundamental exercise strategy for older people are still not well known. Therefore, we attempted to point out the main issues about safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of muscle power training to promote neuromuscular functional improvements in older people."
