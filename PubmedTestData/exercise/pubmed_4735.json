        "Physical activity and exercise are critical for older adults' physical and mental health. The purpose of this qualitative study was to richly capture the motivators of and barriers to engaging in physical activity in previously inactive older adults who participated in a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of eight-week group exercise interventions.",
        "We conducted a qualitative content analysis of individual interviews with fifteen participants-five from each study arm: strength training, walking, and inactive control. Participants included nine females and six males ranging from 60 to 86\u2009years of age.",
        "Key motivators of physical activity included perceived improvements in physical and mental health, positive social influences, observed health deterioration in others, and the desire to spend time with and take care of family members. Barriers to physical activity included existing health conditions, fear of getting hurt, negative social influences, perceived lack of time and motivation, inconvenient times and locations, and monetary cost.",
        "Our findings add to the body of literature identifying factors that motivate and stand in the way of older adults' engagement in physical activity. These factors influence older adults' self-efficacy and should be incorporated into the design of new and existing programs to encourage initiation and maintenance of physical activity."
