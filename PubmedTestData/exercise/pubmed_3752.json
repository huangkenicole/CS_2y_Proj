        "The classic symptom of peripheral arterial disease is the intermittent claudication (IC). Generally, endurance training is recommended to improve patients' walking performance. A potential benefit of the combination with strength training and the optimal duration of such an exercise program remain unclear.",
        "We evaluated the effects of a supervised exercise program combining endurance and strength training lasting 6 or 12 months in patients with IC. A total of 94 patients joined this study; 42 completed the 6-month training program (group A), whereas 52 patients completed the 12-month protocol (group B). Both groups exhibited a significant increase in all parameters evaluated, but greater benefit was found in the 12-month training group. The absolute claudication distance increased similarly by 27.5 and 29.5\u2009%, respectively, in both groups (not significant); however, group B exhibited a greater increase in walking speed (12.1 vs. 5.3\u2009%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). All strength parameters increased significantly in both the groups showing an increase for \"pushing\" by 90.0\u2009% (group A) and 90.2\u2009% (group B), for \"pulling\" by 64.2\u2009% (group A) and 75.3\u2009% (group B), and for \"tiptoe standing\" by 70.5\u2009% (group A) and 113.7\u2009% (group B; p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "The results of this study indicate that a combined exercise program significantly increases walking speed, absolute claudication distance, and muscle strength parameters. A greater benefit seems to result from a 12-month training program."
