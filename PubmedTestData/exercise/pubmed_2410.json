        "Cognitive dysfunction is a public health issue, which is one of the main contributing factors for need-of-care, afflicting patients and their caretakers. It is well accepted that physical activity is in close relationship with brain function. Accumulating data has indicated that exercise training can improve brain functions both directly and indirectly via the alleviation of the diseases underlying, including hypertension and diabetes. Recently, mechanisms bridging brain functions and physical exercises have begun to be clarified. Further studies are required for the understanding of the whole picture of neuropsychiatric diseases and for the development of effective exercise therapy for these diseases."
