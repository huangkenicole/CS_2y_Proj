      "AbstractText": [
        "The present study tested the possibility of a localized fat mass (FM) reduction by means of training programmes focusing on specific bodily regions.",
        "Sixteen physically inactive women (age: 31\u00b14; BMI: 27.5\u00b12.1), randomly allocated to two groups, completed an 8 week training programme. In one group (UpBdResist) training sessions consisted of upper body resistance exercises followed by 30-minute cycling at 50%VO2max, while the other group (LwBdResist) performed lower body resistance exercises followed by 30 minutes on an arm-ergometer. Regional body composition was assessed by DEXA and skin fold measures.",
        "Regardless of a similar reduction in both groups, UpBdResist training elicited a greater reduction of the upper limbs (UL) FM as compared to the lower limbs (LL) (\u0394% UL vs. LL: -12.1\u00b13.4 vs. -4.0\u00b14.7; P=0.02). Conversely, in the LwBdResist group, FM loss was more pronounced in the LL as compared to the UL (\u0394% UL vs. LL: -2.3\u00b17.0 vs. -11.5\u00b18.2, P=0.02). Likewise, LwBdResist elicited a larger effect on lean mass (LM) of the LL as compared to UL (\u0394% LL vs. UL: +8.4\u00b15.8 vs. -2.7\u00b15.0, P<0.01), yet no differences between upper and lower limb LM changes were detected in UpBdResist group.",
        "The present data suggest that a training programme entailing localized explosive resistance exercise, prior to an endurance exercise bout, may target specific adipose tissue sites eliciting localised fat mass loss in the upper and lower limbs."
