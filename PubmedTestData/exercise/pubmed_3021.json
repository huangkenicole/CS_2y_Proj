        "Hackett, DA. Influence of movement velocity on accuracy of estimated repetitions to failure in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2701-2708, 2022-This study explored the accuracy in estimated repetitions to failure (ERF) and changes in mean concentric velocity (MCV) during resistance exercise. Twenty male resistance trainers (age, 26.3 \u00b1 6.9 years; body mass, 82.0 \u00b1 6.0 kg; stature, 178.0 \u00b1 5.5 cm) completed 5 sets of 10 repetitions for the bench press and squat at 70% one-repetition maximum. Subjects' reported their rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and ERF after the 10th repetition of each set and then continued repetitions to momentary muscle failure (5-minute recovery between sets). Barbell velocity was assessed using a linear position transducer. For the bench press, MCV at repetitions 9-10 decreased as sets progressed ( p \u2264 0.005) with a greater loss of MCV for sets 3-5 vs. set 1 ( p \u2264 0.005). No significant changes in MCV variables were found across sets for the squat. Error in ERF was greater in set 1 for the bench press ( p \u2264 0.005) with no differences for the remaining sets. There were no differences between sets for error in ERF for the squat. Moderate to strong relationships were found between most MCV variables and RPE and ERF, for the bench press ( rs = -049 to 0.73; p \u2264 0.005). For the squat only, MCV at repetitions 9-10 was moderately related with RPE ( rs = -0.33; p \u2264 0.003) and actual repetitions to failure ( rs = 0.31; p \u2264 0.003). No significant relationships were found for error in ERF for either the bench press or squat. Changes in MCV across sets may influence perception of effort and performance for the bench press; however, it does not influence the accuracy in ERF for either exercise."
