        "This randomized clinical trial was aimed to assess whether pulmonary function would change in sedentary elderly people after a controlled exercise program. 45 participants over 75 yr. of age (M age 83.7 +/- 3.0) were assigned randomly to a control and two aerobic exercise groups of moderate and high intensity. In 10 wk. the program sessions were 40 min. in duration 3 days per week. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1.0) were measured pre- and post-intervention. After the training, the Moderate intensity group experienced significant mean change in FVC. In the High intensity group, significant changes were observed in both FVC and FEV1.0, but no change was noted for the Control group. The 10-wk. aerobic training of moderate or high intensity showed positive effects on pulmonary function in these elderly individuals. These exercise-induced changes may be dose-related."
