        "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant of neurotrophins in the brain, is known to be responsible for maintenance of neurons has been implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia. In the present pilot study, we investigated the effect of a combined exercise program on circulating BDNF expression and the relationship between BDNF and improvements in physical fitness. Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia participated in the exercise intervention, three nonconsecutive days per week for 12 weeks. The resistance exercise program used the elastic band for eight different exercises for 25 min, and the aerobic exercise consisted of moderate walking for 25 min. After the training program, there were positive improvements in body composition and blood pressure. Also, there was significant improvement in leg strength, cardiovascular fitness, balance, and jump. Serum BDNF values had significantly increased following the combined exercise program. The elevation in serum BDNF concentrations correlated significantly with improvements in cardiovascular fitness and leg strength. These results suggest that exercise induced modulation of BDNF may play an important role in developing non-pharmacological treatment for chronic schizophrenic patients. In addition, these preliminary results serve to generate further hypothesis and facilitate the planning the exercise training program and management of participants."
