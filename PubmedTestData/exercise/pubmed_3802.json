        "Many patients with leukemia experience cancer-related fatigue (CRF). However, when patients are admitted for treatment with chemotherapy, clinicians often overlook CRF and interventions that can help to manage it. The purpose of this four-week intervention was to determine whether a nurse-led exercise activity would reduce CRF and increase physical activity compared to current practice. The results suggest that nurse-led exercise programs can immediately decrease CRF and increase activity in admitted patients with leukemia receiving chemotherapy. Including patients in nurse-led exercise activities can support active participation in their own care during and after hospitalization."
