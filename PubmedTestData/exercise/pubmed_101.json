        "The level of exercise among older adults is low, particularly among those living in health-care institutions. To gain insight into the perceptions of institutionalized older adults towards the exercise programs developed in long-term care institutions and to identify their wishes and needs regarding these programs, we conducted a qualitative study using focus group discussions. Thirty-six institutionalized participants (\u2265 65 years) were recruited. Six common themes emerged: participants' attitudes and motivations towards the exercise programs, self-perceived health, knowledge of the concept of physical exercise, perceived effects of the exercise programs, and wishes or expectations for the exercise programs. The main wishes were to increase frequency of exercise sessions, to exercise outdoor and to increase walking times. The results suggest the need for changes in the development of exercise programs, including changes in the frequency, performance environment and types of exercises performed."
