        "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 14-week resistance training programme implemented with high levels of effort to improve physical fitness in people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) living in group homes.",
        "Fifty-two individuals with mild to moderate IDs participated in the experimental (n\u00a0=\u00a027; 15 men) or control groups (n\u00a0=\u00a025; 14 men). Participants performed 2 familiarisation sessions, 1 pretest, 42 training sessions (14\u00a0weeks\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 sessions; only the experimental group) and 1 posttest. The testing sessions comprised the evaluation of body composition, static balance and muscle strength. The training sessions included four blocks: (1) dynamic bodyweight exercises, (2) dynamic exercises performed against external loads, (3) ballistic exercises and (4) static exercises.",
        "The main findings revealed that all variables related to body composition and muscle strength improved more after the intervention period in the experimental group than the control group, whereas the improvements in static balance for the experimental groups were lower than for the remaining variables used as markers of physical fitness.",
        "These findings highlight the importance of prescribing specific moderate-intensity to high-intensity resistance training programmes to improve body composition and muscle strength for people with IDs living in group homes."
