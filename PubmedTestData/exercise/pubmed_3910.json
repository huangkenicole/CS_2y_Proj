        "The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of two rehabilitation protocols, dance movement therapy exercises (DMT) and general rehabilitation exercises (GRE), on erythrocyte deformability and plasma levels of nitrite plus nitrate as end products of nitric oxide (NOx) in elderly women.",
        "The study included 39 women aged 61-82\u00a0years, subjected to either GRE (n\u00a0=\u00a020) or DMT (n\u00a0=\u00a019). Women were subjected to 5-months programs of GRE and DMT, with each session lasting no longer than 45-50\u00a0min, and the intensity of exercising corresponding to no more than 40-60% of heart rate reserve. Plasma levels of NOx were determined spectrophotometrically before and at the end of the intervention.",
        "A significant increase in the total nitrate/nitrite concentration from 1.341\u00a0\u03bcmol/L to 1.590\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (7.3%) was observed in women subjected to the DMT rehabilitation program. Furthermore, an increase in erythrocyte deformability was observed in this group at shear stress 0.30. No significant difference was found between the pre- and post-rehabilitation NOx levels of women participating in the GRE program.",
        "Participation in DMT rehabilitation program might be reflected by an increase in plasma NOx levels and an improvement of erythrocyte deformability at lesser shear stress, and thus could potentially result in better vascular function. DMT should be offered to older adults, especially to persons who do not find conventional forms of rehabilitation as attractive, as they might refrain from physical activity and suffer from a faster decline in nitric oxide production.
