        "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of calisthenic exercises on functionality, mobility, disaese activity, quality of life, and psychological status in patients with Ankylosing spondylitis (AS).",
        "Prospective analysis of forty patients diagnosed with AS were randomized into two exercise groups. AS patients having diagnosis based on 1984-modified New York criteria were involved. Patients were given 8 weeks calisthenic exercise program. Outcome measures including the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL), Bath AS Patient Global Score (BAS-G) Hospital Anxiety Depression Score (HADS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed at the baseline and at 8 weeks.",
        "Thirty-seven participants completed the exercise programme. After the 8-week exercise programme, the home-based exercise group showed significant improvement in ESR levels and hospital-based exercise group showed significant improvements in terms of the BASMI and HADS-A scores.",
        "Calisthenic exercises can be easily performed both at home and in hospital setting. In patients with AS, calisthenic exercises performed at the hospital may improve the mobility, and psychological status (anxiety)."
