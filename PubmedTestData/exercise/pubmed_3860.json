      "AbstractText": [
        "The current pilot, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the feasibility of remotely-delivered and supported aerobic walking exercise training compared with an active control condition on cognitive processing speed (CPS) in 19 fully-ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) who were pre-screened for impaired CPS.",
        "Feasibility was assessed in the domains of process (e.g., recruitment), resource (e.g., monetary costs), management (e.g., time requirements), and scientific outcomes (i.e., treatment effect). Fully-ambulatory, but CPS-impaired pwMS were randomly assigned into either 16-weeks of home-based aerobic walking exercise or home-based stretching and range-of-motion activities. Both conditions involved delivery of informational newsletters and one-on-one, online video chats with a behavior coach. Participants across both conditions tracked their activity using highly accurate wearable motion sensors. Treatment-blinded assessors administered the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) remotely before and after the 16-week study period.",
        "The study was cost-effective, accessible, and acceptable. The intervention further was safe. Adherence and compliance rates across both conditions exceeded 80%. There was an overall moderate effect for change in SDMT score between the conditions (d\u00a0=\u00a00.42). The intervention was associated with a 4.8-point improvement in SDMT scores (d\u00a0=\u00a00.70; 10% increase) compared with a 1-point improvement for the control condition (d\u00a0=\u00a00.09; 2% increase).",
        "This remotely-delivered and supported aerobic walking exercise training intervention was safe and feasible for fully-ambulatory, CPS-impaired pwMS. The pattern of results, including the promising effects on CPS, support the design and implementation of an appropriately-powered RCT on this approach for managing CPS impairment in a large MS sample."
