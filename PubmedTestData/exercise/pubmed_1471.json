        "To compare the accuracy when osteoarthritic knee patients do quadriceps isometric exercise using quadriceps education device (QED) and not using QED after being instructed on the exercise program by doctors.",
        "A randomized controlled study was conducted. Sixty patients were divided into 2 groups, QED group (patients using QED) and non-QED group (patients not using QED). We developed the Quadriceps Educational Device (QED). All patients were instructed on the quadriceps exercise method. Patients in the QED group were instructed to use the QED device and received the QED to take back and conducted the exercises at home. After 2 weeks, both groups of patients were tested by asking them to do the quadriceps exercise without using the QED. The accuracy of the quadriceps exercise was analyzed to determine the statistical difference. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.",
        "The number of patients in the QED group that conducted accurate quadriceps exercise totaled 23 patients (79.3%), while the number of non-QED was reduced to 8 patients (28.6%). The results were significantly different in statistic (p < 0.01). Patients in the QED group conducted the quadriceps exercise more accurately than the non-QED group.",
        "The osteoarthritic knee patients, who used QED, can do the quadriceps isometric exercise more accurately than those who did not use the QED after being instructed on the exercise program by doctors."
