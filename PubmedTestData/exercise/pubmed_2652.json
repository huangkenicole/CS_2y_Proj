        "Many studies have emphasized the importance of stabilization exercises (SE) for the management of non-specific low back pain (NSLBP), yet there is no study assessing all aspects of core stability in comparing SE and other exercises.",
        "To investigate the effects of SE on pain and core stability by using core stability tests that focus on all aspects of core stability in patients with NSLBP.",
        "Thirty-seven individuals with chronic NSLBP were randomly divided into two groups as SE and conventional exercises (CE). Both groups underwent the progressive exercise program three days per week for six weeks. The assessments were conducted before and after the exercise programs. The outcome measures included pain, disability, trunk strength, trunk flexor, extensor and lateral flexor endurance, function, flexibility, and motor control during eyes open/closed.",
        "All assessment parameters except motor control during eyes open improved after SE (p\u200a<\u200a0.05). Also, all assessment parameters except motor control during eyes open/closed and lateral trunk endurance improved after CE (p\u200a<\u200a0.05). When comparing groups for gain scores, there were more significant improvements in pain during activity, endurance and function after SE (p\u200a<\u200a0.05).",
        "SE is more effective than CE in reducing pain during activity and improving core stability regarding functionality and endurance."
