        "To assess the effectiveness of the EFICANCER individualized and supervised exercise program for people with gastrointestinal, breast, or non-small cell lung stage IV cancer, in terms of quality of life and functional capacity.",
        "Randomized controlled clinical trial with two parallel groups: EFICANCER (n\u202f=\u202f47) and control (n\u202f=\u202f43). Both groups received\u00a0standard oncological care. In addition, the EFICANCER group participated in a nurse-supervised exercise program. Primary outcome was cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire) and general quality of life (SF-36) at baseline and after 2, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were functional capacity (6-minute walking test), strength, and fatigue. The evolution in both groups was compared over 12 months using mixed-effect longitudinal models; 74.47% of patients completed at least one session of the\u00a0program. At 12 months, EFICANCER group had better scores in cancer-related quality of life, with a difference between groups of 15.7 points (95% confidence interval 4.4 to 25.9) and in functional capacity,\u00a0with a difference of 4.5 points (95% confidence interval -0.5 to 9.5). No significant differences in any other secondary variables were observed.",
        "The EFICANCER primary care nurse supervised exercise program is safe and feasible and improves cancer patient's outcomes.",
        "Providing the best care and trying to improve the quality of life of cancer patients are essential parts of nursing practice. Eficancer adds a new dimension to nursing practice by providing greater attention and care to patients during treatment through the supervision of physical exercise, thereby contributing to improve the quality of life of this population."
