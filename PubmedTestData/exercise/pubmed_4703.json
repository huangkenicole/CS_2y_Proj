        "Multicomponent training (MT) combines aerobic, strength, postural, and balance exercises and may be a promising intervention strategy for dementia. This meta-analysis study aims to systematize evidence concerning the effectiveness of MT in physical fitness, cognition, and functionality on activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults with dementia and to identify moderation patterns regarding training variables.",
        "4 databases were systematically searched to locate potential trials through March 2019. A total of 2,312 records were identified and a final set of 17 manuscripts reviewed; of these, 6 satisfied all eligibility criteria.",
        "Samples sizes ranged from 27 to 170 participants; MT programs lasted between 4 weeks and 12 months, took place from a daily basis to twice a week, and sessions ranged from 30 to 60 min. The TESTEX scale was used to analyze the methodological quality, and the funnel plots to assess the risk of bias. This meta-analysis revealed that MT interventions benefit older adults with dementia regarding ADL performance (effect size = 0.313 [0.16-0.46]; p < .01), but the evidence was not sufficiently robust to determine the effectiveness of MT on cognitive function and physical fitness, particularly, on agility.",
        "MT may be an important nonpharmacological strategy to enhance ADL functionality on older adults with dementia. Findings suggest that long-term interventions are more prevalent than high-frequency and longer duration exercise sessions. Further evidence is needed for acknowledging its benefits in specific cognitive abilities and physical fitness. This meta-analysis is registered in PROSPERO (no. CRD42020141545)."
