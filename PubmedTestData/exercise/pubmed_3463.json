        "At the posttreatment evaluation, there was a highly significant difference between the study and control groups regarding anxiety (0 vs. 5), depression (3 vs. 12), tension (3 vs. 12), mood changes (0 vs. 7), feeling out of control (0 vs. 7), weak coordination (0 vs. 10), confusion (2 vs. 9), headache (3 vs. 15), tiredness (4 vs. 12), pains (5 vs. 11), tenderness of the breast (2 vs. 8), and cramps (6 vs. 17) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but no such difference was found regarding irritability, insomnia, crying, swelling, or food craving. Regarding the percentage of symptoms changes, there was a highly significant difference between the study and control groups regarding anxiety (-\u00a033.3 vs. 0), depression (-\u00a079.29 vs. 15.56), tension (-\u00a081.18 vs. -\u00a06.79), mood changes (-\u00a033.33 vs. 0), feeling out of control (-\u00a091.67 vs. 0), weak coordination (-\u00a0100 vs. -\u00a09.55), sleeplessness (-\u00a071.43 vs. 0), confusion (-\u00a084.17 vs. -\u00a09.55), headache (-\u00a077.78 vs. -\u00a06.94), fatigue (-\u00a065.69 vs. 0), pains (-\u00a065.83 vs. -\u00a08.93), breast tenderness (-\u00a087.87 vs. 4.55), cramps (-\u00a060.77 vs. 4.55), and swellings (-\u00a055.05 vs. -\u00a08.33), but no such difference was found regarding irritability, crying, or food craving.",
