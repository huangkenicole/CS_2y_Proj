        "Unstable devices in various forms are used as therapeutic adjuncts for prevention or following an injury. A slip-over-the-shoe design with inflatable domes (STEPRIGHT\u00ae Stability Trainer) was developed to improve balance. It is unknown how this unstable device affects muscle activity during a closed-chain exercise such as the forward lunge.",
        "To compare muscle activity across 3 surfaces (STEPRIGHT\u00ae, Both Sides Up [BOSU\u00ae] Balance Trainer, and firm) during a forward lunge.",
        "Within-subject, repeated measures.",
        "University physical therapy research laboratory.",
        "A total of 20 healthy, recreationally active subjects (23.4 [1.47]\u00a0y, 172.7 [14.7]\u00a0cm, 71.6 [16.8]\u00a0kg).",
        "Each subject performed 1 set of 10 repetitions of forward lunge exercise in random order with STEPRIGHT\u00ae, BOSU\u00ae, and firm surface.",
        "Surface electromyography data, normalized to maximum voluntary isometric contractions (%MVIC), was used to assess muscle activity on rectus femoris, vastus medialis oblique (VMO), biceps femoris, lateral gastrocnemius, fibularis longus, and tibialis anterior.",
        "The repeated-measures analysis of variance determined that there was a significant effect for surface type. During the descent of the lunge, the STEPRIGHT\u00ae elicited higher rectus femoris (33% [27%] MVIC) compared with BOSU\u00ae (22% [14%] MVIC) and VMO (44% [15%] MVIC) on STEPRIGHT\u00ae compared with firm (38% [11%] MVIC) (P < .05). During the ascent of the lunge, the rectus femoris (38% [27%] MVIC) using STEPRIGHT\u00ae was higher than BOSU\u00ae (24% [16%] MVIC), and STEPRIGHT\u00ae elicited higher VMO (65% [20%] MVIC) versus BOSU\u00ae (56% [19%] MVIC) (P \u2264 .01). The STEPRIGHT\u00ae for fibularis longus was higher (descent: 51% [20%] MVIC, ascent: 52% [22%] MVIC) than BOSU\u00ae (descent: 36% [15%] MVIC, ascent: 33% [16%] MVIC) or firm (descent: 33% [12%] MVIC, ascent: 35% [15%] MVIC) (P < .001).",
        "Clinicians may choose to use the STEPRIGHT\u00ae for strengthening VMO and fibularis longus muscles, as these were over 41% MVIC or any of the 3 surfaces for endurance training (<25% MVIC) for biceps femoris muscle. This information may be helpful in exercise dosage for forward lunges when using STEPRIGHT\u00ae, BOSU\u00ae, or a firm surface."
