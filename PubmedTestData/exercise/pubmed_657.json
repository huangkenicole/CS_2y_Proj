        "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are an important public health problem, representing about 45% of deaths in the world. Its management is linked to medications, changes in lifestyle, and physical exercise, with the whole-body vibration exercises (WBV) being a promising therapeutic resource. This study aims to investigate the effects of WBV in isolation or associated with other types of exercises in the management of CVDs.",
        "A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines and registered on the PROSPERO platform was carried out. The search took place in the databases PubMed, Cochrane, PEDro, Lilacs, and Science Direct, from the beginning of the databases until January 2021. Descriptors related to WBV and CVD were used. The selected studies were assessed for quality, risk of bias, and level of evidence.",
        "In all, 84 studies were identified, and of these, three were included. The intervention protocols used were analyzed, in addition to the effects of WBV on hemodynamic, cardiovascular, vascular/arterial, and muscle parameters.",
        "The use of different WBV protocols, in isolation, in the improvement of the parameters mentioned above in individuals with CVD is plausible, with significant responses acutely or chronically and can be considered as a safe and effective training resource."
