        "<b>Introduction</b>: Surgery is a major stressor especially for older patients that are prone for postoperative complications and mortality. Hospitalization due to surgery and illness can be major life events, and the age-related impairments in physiological function and the decreased ability to respond to metabolic and hormonal perturbations in response to surgery often lead to a longer convalescence. <b>Areas covered</b>: This article gives an overview of the effects of PET in various surgical fields and also what to account for and expect of PET after various types of surgery. A comprehensive literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, and PEDro database (from the earliest date of each database to March 2019) using search words 'Preoperative Exercise Therapy', 'Physical Therapy' and 'surgery'. Secondly, the literature searches were modified depending on the surgical specialty. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Evidence is growing that preoperative exercise therapy in various surgical specialties is well tolerated and effective, with by far the most evidence in the cardiac surgical field. Future improvements in standards of care and optimal pre-operative preparation should not only focus on the surgical team and the hospital organization but also on incorporating the active role of the patient."
