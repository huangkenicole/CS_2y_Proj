        "Aquatic exercise training may be suitable for people with stable heart failure (HF) to engage in physical activity.",
        "Acceptability, experiences and preferences regarding aquatic and traditional land-based exercise training, were explored in people with HF.",
        "As part of a comparative intervention study, participants completed a questionnaire assessing acceptability, benefits and challenges of aquatic compared to land-based programs. Semi-structured interviews explored participant experiences in greater depth.",
        "Forty-eight participants, (mean age 70\u202f+\u202f/- 11 years), completed the questionnaire and 14 participated in semi structured interviews. Aquatic exercise was regarded as acceptable and beneficial. Motivators were similar for both programs and included: a skilled and compassionate workforce, tailored care, perceived health benefit, sense of safety and an inclusive and enjoyable environment. Few barriers were identified for either program.",
        "Aquatic and land-based exercise training are equally acceptable for people with stable HF and motivators are similar for both programs."
