        "Meteoropathy is no longer considered a popular myth, but a new disease that significantly impacts daily life, particularly in individuals who experience mental illness, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory conditions. However, there are very limited data on this condition. This study aimed to comprehensively review and analyze existing in vivo animal studies and human clinical trials investigating the effects of meteoropathy on health and its pharmacological treatment. A thorough literature search was conducted across databases such as PubMed and Scopus to gather relevant information. Our analysis primarily focused on the relationship between meteoropathy and mental health, including the influence on affective temperaments. Additionally, we explored various treatment approaches, emphasizing the combination of muscle exercises, pharmacological interventions, and naturopathy, which have shown promise in alleviating pain among individuals affected by meteoropathy. Future research in meteoropathy should shed light on synthesizing new pharmacological compounds."
