        "The aim was to evaluate the effects of a supervised 12-week Multicomponent exercise training on elderly women health and behavior indicators.",
        "Anthropometric characteristics and body composition, functional capacity, sedentary behavior, physical activity level and biochemical profile were evaluated in the control group (67.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years, n\u00a0=\u00a014) and in the experimental group (67.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 years, n\u00a0=\u00a041). The experimental group were composed by 41 elderly women who performed 12 weeks of Multicomponent exercise training involving strength, aerobic, flexibility and balance exercises. The inclusion criteria for the study were women aged 60 years or more and presentation of a medical certificate authorizing the practice of physical exercise.",
        "Maintenance of anthropometric characteristics and body composition was observed in both groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). There was an improvement in aerobic capacity, lower and upper limb strength in the experimental group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while the control group showed a reduction in aerobic capacity, lower limb strength, agility and dynamic balance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), as shown in Fi.gure 3. There was a reduction in sedentary behavior and an increase in physical activity level in experimental group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not in control group. Experimental group showed an improvement in glucose levels and lipid profile (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).",
