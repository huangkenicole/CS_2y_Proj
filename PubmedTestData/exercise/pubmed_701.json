        "This study aimed at comparing the effects of three chair-based exercise programs on people older than 80 years. Thirty-six participants (87.91\u2009\u00b1\u20094.70 years) were randomly allocated to an aerobic, muscular resistance, or joint mobility exercise program. The participants exercised 3 days per week during 3 months. A hand-held dynamometer, the Tinetti Gait Balance, the Barthel Index, and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) (assessed by means of the Wiva<sup>\u00ae</sup> science sensor) were used to evaluate the effects of the programs on the participants' strength, balance, functional independence, and functional mobility, respectively. After the intervention, it was observed that only the elastic-band program resulted in significant improvements in strength and balance. These results imply that when choosing a low-cost exercise program for very old people, the use of elastic bands stands as a far better option than pedaling on a pedal exerciser or performing mobility exercises."
