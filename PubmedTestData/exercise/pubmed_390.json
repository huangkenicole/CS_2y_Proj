      "AbstractText": [
        "Exercise is considered a valuable nonpharmacological intervention modality in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in patients with ischemic heart disease. The effect of aerobic interval exercise combined with alternating sets of resistance training (super-circuit training, SCT) on cardiac patients' with reduced left ventricular function, post-myocardial infarction (MI) has not been thoroughly investigated.",
        "to improve cardiac function with a novel method of combined aerobic-resistance circuit training in a randomized control trial by way of comparing the effectiveness of continuous aerobic training (CAT) to SCT on mechanical cardiac function. Secondary to compare their effect on aerobic fitness, manual strength, and quality of life in men post MI. Finally, to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SCT.",
        "29 men post-MI participants were randomly assigned to either 12-weeks of CAT (n = 15) or SCT (n = 14). Both groups, CAT and SCT exercised at 60%-70% and 75-85% of their heart rate reserve, respectively. The SCT group also engaged in intermittently combined resistance training. Primary outcome measure was echocardiography. Secondary outcome measures were aerobic fitness, strength, and quality of life (QoL). The effectiveness of the two training programs was examined via paired t-tests and Cohen's d effect size (ES).",
        "Post-training, only the SCT group presented significant changes in echocardiography (a reduction in E/e' and an increase in ejection fraction, P<0.05). Similarly, only the SCT group presented significant changes in aerobic fitness (an increase in maximal metabolic equivalent, P<0.05). In addition, SCT improvement in the physical component of QoL was greater than this observed in the CAT group. In both training programs, no adverse events were observed.",
        "Men post-MI stand to benefit from both CAT and SCT. However, in comparison to CAT, as assessed by echocardiography, SCT may yield greater benefits to the left ventricle mechanical function as well as to the patient's aerobic fitness and physical QoL. Moreover, the SCT program was found to be feasible as well as safe."
