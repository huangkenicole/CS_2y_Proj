        "<b>Objective:</b> To observe the effects of aerobic exercise combined with resistance training on the cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) . <b>Methods:</b> From June 2014 to December 2015, 73 patients with stable CAD in our department were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (<i>n=</i>38) and the exercise group (<i>n=</i>35) . Patients in both groups received conventional medical treatment for CAD and related cardiac health education. While for patients in exercise group, a twelve-week aerobic exercise combined with resistance training program were applied on top of conventional treatment and health education. Cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity were evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. <b>Results:</b> (1) The exercise capacity was significantly increased in the exercise group after 12 weeks training as compared to baseline level: peak oxygen uptake per kilogram ( (26.25\u00b15.14) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) vs. (20.88\u00b14.59) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) , anaerobic threshold ( (15.24\u00b12.75) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) vs. (13.52\u00b12.92) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)], peak oxygen pulse ( (11.91\u00b12.89) ml/beat vs. (9.77\u00b12.49) ml/beat) , peak Watts ( (113.2\u00b134.0) W vs. (103.7\u00b127.9) W) , peak metabolic equivalent ( (7.57\u00b11.46) METs vs. (6.00\u00b11.32) METs) (all <i>P<</i>0.05 vs. baseline) . (2) The degree of improvement of peak oxygen uptake per kilogram ( (26.25\u00b15.14) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) vs. (22.32\u00b14.00) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) , anaerobic threshold ( (15.24\u00b12.75) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) vs. (13.76\u00b12.51) ml\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) , peak oxygen pulse ( (11.91\u00b12.89) ml/beat vs. (9.99\u00b12.15) ml/beat) and peak metabolic equivalent ( (7.57\u00b11.46) METs vs. (6.47\u00b11.17) METs) were significantly higher in exercise group than in control group (all <i>P<</i>0.05) . <b>Conclusion:</b> Aerobic training at an aerobic threshold level combined with Thera-band resistance training is safe for patients with stable coronary artery disease. This combined exercise program can significantly improve the cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity of patients with stable coronary artery disease."
