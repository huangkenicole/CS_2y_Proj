        "This study assessed the Stay Strong, Stay Healthy (SSSH) level two resistance training program in 406 older adults (69.3 \u00b1 8.1\u00a0years). SSSH included 10 exercises completed during 60\u00a0minute sessions, which were offered twice weekly for eight\u00a0weeks. 30-second sit-to-stand (30STS), timed-up-and-go (TUG), flexibility, and balance poses were completed pre/post-SSSH. Paired <i>t</i>-tests with Bonferroni corrections showed the whole group improved 30STS, TUG, flexibility, and total balance scores over time (<i>p</i> < .001). Repeated measures analyses of variance showed both geography and age groups improved 30STS, TUG, flexibility, and total balance scores over time (all time effects <i>p</i> \u2264 .039). Independent <i>t</i>-tests showed rural participants improved to a similar or greater absolute extent than their urban neighbors for nearly all measures and all age groups improved to a similar absolute magnitude over time. This study demonstrates SSSH level two improves physical function in older adults and these benefits are similar across geography and age groups."
