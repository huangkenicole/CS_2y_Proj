      "AbstractText": [
        "Twenty-eight active older people (67.19 \u00b1 4.91 years) who engaged in physical exercise activity twice a week were recruited to participate in a counterbalanced experimental protocol. The participants performed three different exercise sessions on three different days, one based on aerobic activities, one based on strength exercises with elastic bands, and one based on stationary balance games. During all three sessions, they were encouraged to maintain a moderate subjective intensity (5-6 on the RPE10 scale), and their heart rate was recorded. In addition, all of the participants took a digital version of the Stroop test before and after each session. The study aimed to compare the acute cognitive impacts of different types of exercise sessions in older adults. The participants' heart rate differed between the exercise sessions, but they maintained the RPE intensity. There was a significant improvement in inhibitory control (Stroop test) after all sessions, with no differences between exercise sessions. Moreover, some participants agreed to be genotyped to record the single nucleotide polymorphism of BDNF rs6265. There were no differences between Val/Val and Met carriers at the beginning or end of the exercise sessions. The present study showed similar cognitive improvements with different exercise type sessions when the subjective intensity was maintained."
