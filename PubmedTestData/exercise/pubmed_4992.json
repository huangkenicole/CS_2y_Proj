      "AbstractText": [
        "The American Diabetes Association (ADA) currently recommends 150\u202fmin of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week and resistance exercise at least twice per week in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to improve overall health [1]. However, approximately 38% of patients with T2DM do not exercise at recommended levels and 31% do not exercise at all [2]. The efficacy of structured exercise interventions has been proven effective in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients, but practical approaches are needed to translate these findings into the clinical setting [3-7].",
        "The Initiate and Maintain Physical Activity in Clinics (IMPACT) Study aims to compare structured group exercise within the clinic to usual care in T2DM patients. The main purpose of the study is to determine the optimal and feasible level and weekly frequency of structured contact in a clinical setting needed to initiate and maintain physical activity recommendations long-term.",
        "IMPACT is a longitudinal, randomized-controlled study designed to track study participants over 30\u202fmonths. Once study participants have met eligibility and enrollment criteria, they are randomized and enrolled into one of three arms: 1\u00d7 per week exercise, 3\u00d7 per week exercise, or the usual care control group. After randomization, participants begin Phase 1: Initiate lasting 6\u202fmonths. Over the course of Phase 1, participants in the exercise groups will attend instructor led group training at a Stanford approved physical fitness facility. At the end of 6\u202fmonths, participants enter Phase 2: Maintain lasting 24\u202fmonths. Over the course of Phase 2, participants in all three arms will attend periodic follow-up visits for clinical measurements and survey administration for their final two years of participation. These findings will enable the clinical implementation of a structured exercise regimen designed to specifically address the aerobic and resistance training recommendations for patients with T2DM."
