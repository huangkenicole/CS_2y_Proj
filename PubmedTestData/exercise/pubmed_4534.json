        "To report hamstring prevention strategies of professional male cricket clubs in the United Kingdom, identify the application of the Nordic hamstring programme (NHP) and gain knowledge of medical teams' reasons for the NHP's inclusion or exclusion.",
        "Cross-sectional questionnaire.",
        "Online survey.",
        "15 (75%) of professional cricket clubs in the United Kingdom.",
        "Survey based on the RE-AIM framework.",
        "Twelve clubs reported having a formal hamstring injury prevention programme. The Nordic hamstring exercise and eccentric exercises (100%) were the most used interventions. Three clubs implemented the NHP, with one classed as fully compliant. Respondents partially agreed, on a 5 point Likert scale, that the Nordic hamstring exercise was effective at reducing injuries at their club (Mean 3.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 0.70) and across professional cricket (3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.64). Barriers to implementation across cricket included players not positively perceiving the programme (60%) with a cultural change required (60%) for its adoption.",
        "The Nordic hamstring exercise is positively received by medical personnel in professional cricket in conjunction with other prevention strategies. Three clubs have utilised the NHP in the last three seasons with one club considered fully compliant. A cultural shift from players and coaches may be required for successful NHP implementation."
