        "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world. In the industrialized world, the incidence and prevalence of lung cancer are increasing. Environmental influences and genetics play an important role in pathogenesis. A major part of treatment includes rehabilitation. Lung cancer results in impaired physical performance and poor quality of life. Rehabilitation programs contribute to stabilizing the course of the disease and lead to increased self-confidence in patients. An essential part of rehabilitation comprises functional testing of the patient including a 6-minute walk test, chair standing test, standing up and go test, likewise timed walking tests, supplemented by strength and muscle mass assessment. Physical exercise therapy includes aerobic exercise and resistance training. Rehabilitation of lung cancer patients has been shown to improve symptoms of fatigue and improve patients quality of life. Another significant benefit is the improvement of patients functional abilities.",
        "The main aim of this article was to summarize information on rehabilitation treatment modalities in patients with lung cancer."
