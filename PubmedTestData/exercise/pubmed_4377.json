        "Dementia population worldwide is considerable in elderly people. Exercise regulates the brain function, but the mechanism by which it does so is unknown. The effect of regular exercise on cognitive function and exercise capacity in senile dementia patients was investigated. Thirty female patients with senile dementia who participated in the study were divided into two groups: the exercise group (EG, n = 15) and the control group (CG, n = 15). The exercise group completed a regular exercise program, and their cognitive function, activities of daily living and exercise capacity levels were evaluated at baseline, 6 months and after 12 months. Subjects exercised 30 - 60 minutes per day, 2 - 3 times per week for 12 months. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (pre: 14.53 +/- 5.34, post: 17.47 +/- 6.90) and ADL (pre: 14.40 +/- 5.32, post: 17.53 +/- 5.46) scores were significantly enhanced in the exercise group with senile dementia, compared to those in the control group. Exercise capacities such as cardiopulmonary function (pre: 128.47 +/- 55.43, post: 184.40 +/- 41.16), muscle strength (pre: 10.07 +/- 3.61, post: 13.7 +/- 3.90), muscular endurance (pre: 8.13 +/- 4.45, post: 12.13 +/- 5.14), flexibility (- 1.53 +/- .30, post: 2.20 +/- .70, balance (pre: 1.73 +/- .28, post: 1.20 +/- .77), and agility (pre: 21.80 +/- 3.24, post: 10.87 +/- 2.99) also increased in the exercise group. Our findings showed that regular exercise can enhance cognitive and functional activity scores in dementia patients, suggesting that senile dementia may improve by participating in a regular exercise program."
