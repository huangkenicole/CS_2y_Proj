      "AbstractText": [
        "Among all types of cervical spondylitis, cervical spondylitis radiculopathy (CSR) has the highest incidence. The incidence of CSR increases year by year and is generally younger, which has seriously threatened people's quality of life and affected their work and life. This study proposes to improve the recovery rate of patients with CSR, delay the recurrence, improve the symptoms of patients, and improve the quality of life of patients through the rehabilitation and exercise of five-step cervical vertebra exercises.",
        "For 90 patients with CSR that met the inclusion criteria, SPSS 23.0 software random number generator was used to randomly divide the patients into an experimental group and control group, with 45 cases in each group. The control group took basic nursing measures, and the experimental group took five steps of cervical vertebra rehabilitation exercises on the basis of elementary nursing measures. The rehabilitation effect of five-step exercises on CSR patients was evaluated by Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Cervical range of motion measured (CROM) before and after intervention.",
        "The results of this trial will be published on the website of China Clinical Trial Registration Center (http://www.chictr.org.cn/searchproj.aspx) and in peer-reviewed journals or academic conferences.",
        "This study will examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of five-step exercises for the treatment of patients with CSR.",
        "This protocol was registered in Clinical Trials platform with the number ChiCTR1900027299."
