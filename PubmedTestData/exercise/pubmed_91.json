        "Lay abstract Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome is characterized by presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait. Patients who are diagnosed with this syndrome are at high risk for developing dementia. Hence, it is important to develop safe and effective exercise programs to prevent cognitive decline in these patients. Our study shows that home-based exercises with telephonic coaching are both safe as well as feasible in patients with Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome. Participants reported high satisfaction with the exercise intervention, and strong interest in participating in future studies. They found the individualized exercise program to be appropriate to their own level of fitness, and this provided them confidence to continue exercising at home."

        "<b>Aim:</b> We developed a home-based goal-directed exercise program with telephonic coaching to overcome barriers to exercise participation in cognitively impaired older adults. <b>Methods:</b> Six patients with Motoric Cognitive Risk\u00a0syndrome at high risk for dementia were enrolled, three assigned to goal-directed exercises and three to stretching exercises. All participants underwent an in-person training session followed by a session at home with a telephonic coach. Sessions were supervised by a physiatrist, and exercise programs were personalized. <b>Results:</b> In-person training and remote telephonic coaching support promoted adherence. There were no adverse effects and interventions were rated highly. Participant and logistical barriers were identified that can inform design of home-based clinical trials. <b>Conclusion:</b> Home-based exercises are safe and feasible in older adults with Motoric Cognitive Risk."
