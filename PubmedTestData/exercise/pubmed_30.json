        "Although strength exercise is often prescribed for people with haemophilia (PWH), it remains unknown how exercise variables and pain thresholds are used to prescribe strength training in PWH.",
        "To analyse how strength exercise variables and pain thresholds have been used to prescribe strength training in PWH.",
        "A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases from inception to 7 September 2022. Studies whose intervention included strengthening training in adults with haemophilia were included. Two independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment.",
        "Eighteen studies were included. The least reported variables among the studies were: prophylactic factor coverage (11.1%), pain threshold/tolerability (5.6%), intensity (50%), total or partial range of motion (27.8%), time under tension (27.8%), attentional focus modality (0%), therapist experience in haemophilia (33.3%) and adherence assessment (50%). In contrast, weekly frequency (94.4%), duration (weeks) (100%), number of sets/repetitions (88.9%), repetitions to failure/not to failure (77.8%), types of contraction (77.8%), rest duration (55.6%), progression (55.6%), supervision (77.8%), exercise equipment (72.2%) and adverse event record (77.8%) had a higher percentage of reported (>50% of studies).",
        "Future research on strength training for PWH should improve information on pain threshold and other important variables such as prophylactic factor coverage, intensity, range of motion, time under tension, attentional focus modality, therapist experience in haemophilia and adherence assessment. This could improve clinical practice and comparison of different protocols."
