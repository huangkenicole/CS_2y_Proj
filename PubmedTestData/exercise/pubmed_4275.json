        "The use of unstable surfaces has been proposed to increase the neuromuscular demand. This strategy has been adopted to generate an increase in the activity of periscapular muscles due to its role in the stabilization of the scapula. However, the influence of this instability on the EMG activity remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of using unstable surfaces on the EMG activity of the periscapular muscles.",
        "A comprehensive search in the PubMed, EMBASE, SCIELO, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Cochrane and LILACS databases was undertaken from their year of inception up to December 2019. Studies which directly investigated the EMG activity of periscapular muscles in healthy individuals while performing exercises for the upper limbs in stable and unstable conditions.",
        "A total of 33 studies which evaluated a total of 678 healthy individuals were found according to the eligibility criteria. A meta-analysis identified that the EMG activity of the upper trapezius showed a trivial increase with the insertion of the unstable surface (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.14 [95%CI 0.00, 0.27]). No significant effects were observed on the middle trapezius (P\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and lower trapezius (P\u00a0=\u00a00.25). A decrease of the anterior serratus EMG activity with a small effect size was observed by implementing an unstable surface (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.21 [95%CI -0.36,\u00a0-0.05]).",
        "The use of unstable surfaces generated a trivial increase in the upper trapezius activity, and a slight decrease in the anterior serratus activity. No effect was observed on the middle and lower trapezius."
