        "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of online functional exercises and posture exercises on lower limb functions, posture, and physical activity in office workers working at home and in office alternately during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Forty individuals were included in the study and were randomized into two groups: group I (functional exercise group, 20 participants) and group II (posture exercise group, 20 participants). The exercises programs were performed online for 2 days/in a week/8 wk. Lower limb functions, posture, and physical activity were evaluated before and after the exercise program.",
        "Significant improvement was obtained in lower limb functions (muscular endurance, balance, and functional capacity), posture, and physical activity in group I, while significant improvement was obtained in balance and functional capacity in group II after treatment. The change in scores of lower limb functions, posture, and physical activity after treatment was statistically superior in group I compared with group II ( P < 0.05).",
        "It was found that both online exercise programs provided effective results in office workers working at home and in office alternately due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the functional exercise program had superior effects on lower limb functions, posture, and physical activity compared with the posture exercise program."
