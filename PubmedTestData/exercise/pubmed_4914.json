        "Aquatic exercise (AE) is becoming ever more popular as a physical therapy, while it is unclear what precise improvements it will produce and how effective it will be in comparison with other non-surgical therapies. The study aimed to assess whether AE positively impacts chronic musculoskeletal disorder patients in terms of pain, physical function, and quality of life.",
        "PRISMA guidelines were followed, and our study protocol was published online at PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023417411. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases for English-language articles published before April 11, 2023, including studies from all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). After screening, we ultimately included 32 RCTs with a total of 2,200 participants. We also performed subgroup analyses for all included studies. This meta-analysis calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and the variance was estimated using a random-effects model. The quality of the included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane collaborative \"risk of bias\" assessment tool (version 2.0). Thus ensuring that the literature included is of high quality.",
        "This meta-analysis included 32 trials with 2,200 participants; these patients were all between the ages of 38-80. The study showed that compared to the no exercise (NE) group, patients in the AE group experienced a remarkable reduction in pain (SMD: -0.64, P\u2009<\u20090.001), a significant increase in physical function (SMD: 0.62, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and a statistically significant improvement in quality of life (SMD: -0.64, P\u2009<\u20090.001). When compared to land-based exercise (LE), AE significantly relieves patients' pain (SMD: -0.35, P\u2009=\u20090.03).",
        "This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to study whether AE could improve chronic musculoskeletal disorders. The evidence suggests that AE benefits pain, physical function, and quality of life in adults with chronic musculoskeletal conditions compared to NE. Furthermore, when compared to LE, AE continues to provide a better improvement in patient pain. More long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm AE's positive effects and improvement mechanisms and the more existential advantages compared to LE."
