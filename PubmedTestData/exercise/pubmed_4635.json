        "The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of water-based exercises on the physical functions and quality of life (QOL) in community-dwelling elderly people with history of falling.",
        "Participants were randomly assigned to the water-based exercise group (n=34) or land-based exercise groups (n=32). To identify the effects on physical functions, muscle strength, flexibility, and mobility were measured. QOL and fear of falling were evaluated using the Short Form 36-item questionnaire and the modified falls efficacy scale (M-FES). The measurements were performed before and after the 10-week training period.",
        "Within-group analysis indicated that hip abduction and adduction strength improved significantly in both groups (p=0.005; p=0.007). However, no statistically significant within-group differences were found in the back scratch test (p=0.766) and chair sit-and-reach test (p=0.870). QOL was significantly different in both groups (health transition: p=0.014, physical functioning: p<0.001, role physical: p<0.001, role emotional: p=0.002, bodily pain: p<0.001, vitality: p<0.001, and mental health: p<0.001). There was a significant difference in the M-FES in both groups (p=0.040).",
        "These results indicate that water-based exercises are beneficial to improve the QOL, as well as physical activities, of community-dwelling elderly compared with land-based exercise. Water-based exercises would be useful to improve physical and psychological health in the elderly people with history of falling."
