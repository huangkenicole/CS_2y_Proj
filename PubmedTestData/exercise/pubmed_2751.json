        "Breast cancer and oncological treatment can result in significant acute and late localized and systemic negative effects on health-related physical fitness and physical function. The aim of this single-arm study was to examine the effects of a 12-week community-based multimodal exercise program on health-related physical fitness and physical function in breast cancer survivors.",
        "A total of 52 female breast cancer survivors (mean age = 59.7 \u00b1 10.4 years) completed supervised exercise training consisting of (1) aerobic conditioning, (2) resistance training, and (3) balance and flexibility training, for 30 minutes each, totaling 90 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment outcome measures-mobility: (1) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and (2) 6-minute walk test (6MWT); muscular strength: (3) leg press strength and (4) chest press strength; upper-extremity flexibility: (5) back scratch test; and balance: (6) functional reach (FR) and (7) single-leg stance time-were assessed and compared.",
        "Postintervention assessment measures given as percentage improvement and effect size (ES) for mobility, TUG (18%, 0.59), and 6MWT (14%, 0.74) were significantly (P < .001) improved. Outcome measures of muscular strength, leg press strength (32%, 0.58) and chest press strength (40%, 0.61), both significantly (P < .001) improved. Postintervention assessment measure of upper-extremity flexibility (42%, 0.41) showed significant (P < .001) improvements. Outcome measures for balance, FR (18%, 0.75) and single leg stance time (24%, 0.30), showed significant (P < .001) improvements.",
        "Outcome measures showed moderate to large ES improvements after participants completed the 12-week multimodal exercise program for breast cancer survivors."
