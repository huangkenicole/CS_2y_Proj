        "It is believed that clinical management of osteoarthritis should address muscle weakness to improve physical function and prevent disability and frailty.",
        "This sub-study investigated the effects of supervised progressive resistance training (RT), supervised Nordic Walking (NW), and unsupervised home-based exercise (HBE) on muscle and functional performance; and associations between these exercise-induced changes in persons with hip osteoarthritis.",
        "Forty-two patients with hip osteoarthritis were recruited from a larger RCT (NCT01387867). All the groups (RT, <i>n</i> =\u00a015; NW, <i>n</i> =\u00a012; HBE, <i>n</i> =\u00a015) exercised 1 h 3 times/week for 4\u00a0months. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (QCSA, MRI-determined); quadriceps strength (QMVC); leg extensor power (LEP); functional performance (chair stands (30sCS); stair climbs (TSC); and 6-minute walk (6MWT)) were assessed at baseline and 4\u00a0months.",
        "Per protocol analyses (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test) showed significant between-group differences for improvements in QCSA in the most symptomatic leg favoring RT versus NW (2.3 cm<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI [0.6, 3.9]) and HBE (2.3 cm<sup>2</sup> [0.8, 3.9]); and 30sCS (1.8 repetitions [0.2-3.3]), and 6MWT (35.1 m [3.5-66.7]) favoring NW versus HBE. Associations existed between exercise-induced changes in QCSA and QMVC (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.366, <i>p</i> =\u00a0.019) for the most symptomatic leg and between changes in 6MWT and QMVC (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.320, <i>p</i> =\u00a0.04) and LEP (<i>r</i> =\u00a00.381, <i>p</i> =\u00a0.01), respectively, for the least symptomatic leg.",
        "Resistance training appeared effective for improving muscle mass, but less effective for improving muscle strength, power, and functional performance. Only exercise-induced changes in muscle strength and power of the least symptomatic leg, not the most symptomatic leg, were related to changes in functional performance."
