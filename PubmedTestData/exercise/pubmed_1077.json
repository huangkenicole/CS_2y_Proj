        "This randomized controlled trial randomized 96 participants (64 to cycling and 32 to stretching for six months) and followed them for another six months. The intervention was supervised, moderate-intensity cycling for 20-50 minutes, 3 times a week for six months. The control was light-intensity stretching. Cognition was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog). Discrete cognitive domains were measured using the AD Uniform Data Set battery.",
        "The participants were 77.4\u00b16.8 years old with 15.6\u00b12.9 years of education, and 55% were male. The 6-month change in ADAS-Cog was 1.0\u00b14.6 (cycling) and 0.1\u00b14.1 (stretching), which were both significantly less than the natural 3.2\u00b16.3-point increase observed naturally with disease progression. The 12-month change was 2.4\u00b15.2 (cycling) and 2.2\u00b15.7 (control). ADAS-Cog did not differ between groups at 6 (p\u200a=\u200a0.386) and 12 months (p\u200a=\u200a0.856). There were no differences in the 12-month rate of change in ADAS-Cog (0.192 versus 0.197, p\u200a=\u200a0.967), memory (-0.012 versus -0.019, p\u200a=\u200a0.373), executive function (-0.020 versus -0.012, p\u200a=\u200a0.383), attention (-0.035 versus -0.033, p\u200a=\u200a0.908), or language (-0.028 versus -0.026, p\u200a=\u200a0.756).",
        "Exercise may reduce decline in global cognition in older adults with mild-to-moderate AD dementia. Aerobic exercise did not show superior cognitive effects to stretching in our pilot trial, possibly due to the lack of power."
