        "Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) seem to have a negative attitude towards physical activity, which is mainly favored by the lack of counseling provided by the medical and nursing staff. The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of both ESRD patients and medical staff on the participation and promotion of physical activity and identify the obstacles that discourage patients' involvement in intervention programs.",
        "Subjective assessment questionnaires and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were administrated to hemodialysis patients and medical staff, to investigate the association between patient's barriers to physical activity, the total intensity level of physical activity, and attitudes of both ESRD patients and medical staff on the participation and promotion of physical activity.",
        "A total of 103 ESRD patients (61 men, 59.2%), 20 nephrologists (12 men, 60.0%), and 72 nurses (61 women, 84.7%) participated in the study. Most commonly reported patient's barriers were fatigue on dialysis (97.4%) and non-dialysis days (55.1%). Healthcare staff showed positive attitude towards renal rehabilitation exercise programs. However, most of physicians (85.0%) and nurses (83.3%) did not have previous experience with interventional exercise rehabilitation programs. Binary logistic regression revealed significant association between patients' inactivity, demographic data, and barriers towards physical activity, such as fatigue and pain in dialysis and non-dialysis days (p\u2009<\u20090.05), family's and physician's concern (p\u2009<\u20090.05), too many medical problems (p\u2009<\u20090.05), the fear of getting hurt (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and unwillingness for exercise (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Interestingly, healthcare staff's negative attitudes toward patient's physical activity seem to be strongly associated with patient's inactivity status.",
        "Healthcare staff negative attitudes and multiple related barriers especially fatigue on dialysis and non-dialysis days, towards ESRD patient's physical activity, suppress desire for exercise and active patients' status, leading them to abstain from it."
