        "To evaluate the effect of functional exercises on disease activity, joint function and quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).",
        "Randomized controlled trials were searched in Cochrane Library, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database and Wanfang database with keywords being \"rheumatoid arthritis/RA\", \"function exercise (training)/joint exercise (training)/physical exercise (training)/resistance movement (exercise)/isotonic and isometric/stretching exercise/muscle exercise\", and \"trials/clinical trials\". Then literature selection, extraction and literature quality evaluation were carried out by two of the authors independently following the including and excluding standards. Then the outcome indicators were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 software.",
        "In the study, 2 173 articles were achieved by searching in databases, including 1 522 English papers and 651 Chinese papers. Then 913 duplicated papers were identified and removed using EndNote software. After reading the titles and abstracts, 1 194 papers were excluded that did not satisfy the including standards. Finally, the full texts of these papers were read and papers with insufficient data were excluded, resulting in 13 included papers for systematic review, including 8 English and 5 Chinese papers. A total of 812 cases were studied in these papers, including 426 in the experimental groups and 386 in the conventional groups. For the outcome index in these articles, disease activity score 28 (DAS28) was used in 5 of them, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) was used in 8 articles, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain was used in 6 articles, and morning stiffness duration was used in 3 articles. The meta-analysis showed that functional exercises could delay the development of the disease activity of RA patients (mean difference=-0.76; 95%CI: -1.13, -0.38; P<0.001), improve the joint function (mean difference=-0.36; 95%CI: -0.47, -0.24; P<0.001), alleviate the pain of joints (mean difference=-1.75; 95%CI: -1.98, -1.53; P<0.001), and reduce the duration of morning stiffness (mean difference=-17.65; 95%CI: -22.09, -13.21; P<0.001).",
        "This study showed the positive effects of functional exercises on alleviating the pain of joints, reducing the morning stiffness duration, and delaying the disease exacerbation of RA patients. It has a positive effect on improving the joint function and improving the quality of life in patients with RA."
