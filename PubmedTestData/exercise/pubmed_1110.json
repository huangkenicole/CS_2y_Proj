        "Osteoporosis is a common disorder and is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture. Falls are a proximate cause of a high proportion of medical costs and mortality. Improving balance can reduce the risk of falls and improve health outcomes, especially for the at-risk population of people with osteoporosis and osteopenia. The FrameWorks<sup>TM</sup> exercise program is a formal, standardized, informational and interventional 10-month exercise program. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the improvement in standing balance, functional reach, and overall confidence in balance after participating in the 10-month program.",
        "This study is a prospectively designed study with a pre and post study measurement of balance metrics. Sixty-two female participants, 45 years of age or older and at increased risk for fragility fractures, completed the 10-month program as well the pre and post program testing. Confidence was measured with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, a self-reported survey. Balance was measured digitally by means of testing with a NeuroCom\u00ae Basic Balance Master\u00ae system. Measurements were made of the Limits of Stability (LOS) Test and Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB). Balance was clinically assessed with the Functional Reach Test (FRT).",
        "Participation in the 10 months FrameWorksTM program resulted in improvement in quantitative measures of balance (Composite Sway Velocity, -12%, p < 0.001; End point excursion, 17.1%, p < 0.000001). A clinical measure of balance, the Functional Reach Test, improved, (2.9 cm, p < 0.0001). Participation also resulted in improvement in balance confidence (9.4 %, p < 0.00001). A height increase was observed (0.6 cm, p < 0.000001).",
        "The 10-month FrameWorks<sup>TM</sup> program improves balance and confidence in women at risk for fragility fractures. By improving balance and confidence, people are less likely to fall and therefore sustain fewer fractures and associated injuries."
