        "Cardiorespiratory fitness declines with age and this decline can be accelerated by inactivity and bed rest. Recovery of fitness is possible, but the timeline in 55- to 65-yr-old adults is unknown. Furthermore, the effectiveness of exercise to prevent deconditioning during bed rest is unexplored in this age group. Twenty-two adults (11 women, 59\u2009\u00b1\u20093 yr) completed 2 wk of strict 6\u00b0 head-down bed rest (HDBR). Half of the participants performed approximately 1 h of daily exercises, including high-intensity interval cycling, aerobic cycling, and upper- and lower-body resistance training, whereas control participants were inactive. Step-incremental cycling tests to exhaustion were conducted pre-HDBR and at three times during the recovery phase (<i>day 1</i> or <i>2</i>, <i>day 6</i>, and 4 wk) to assess peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307o<sub>2</sub>). Peak V\u0307o<sub>2</sub> was reduced in the control group throughout the first 6 days of recovery, but did return to pre-HDBR levels by the 4-wk recovery time point (interaction: <i>P</i> = 0.002). In the exercise group, peak V\u0307o<sub>2</sub> was not different at any time point during recovery from pre-HDBR. Ventilatory threshold V\u0307o<sub>2</sub> (interaction: <i>P</i> = 0.002) and heart rate at 15 W (interaction: <i>P</i> = 0.055) mirrored the changes in peak V\u0307o<sub>2</sub> in each respective group. Overall, this study showed that approximately 1 h of daily exercise effectively protected 55- to 65-yr-old adults' cardiorespiratory fitness during 2 wk of HDBR. HDBR without exercise countermeasures caused substantial reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness, but fitness recovered within 4 wk of resuming daily activities. These findings highlight the importance of physical activity in late middle-age adults.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We report the complete time-course of cardiorespiratory fitness recovery back to baseline levels following 2 wk of head-down bed rest in 55- to 65-yr-old adults and found that multimodal training, consisting of high-intensity interval, aerobic and resistive exercises, performed throughout the 2 wk of head-down bed rest prevented reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness."
