        "To evaluate the efficacy of physical therapy or exercise intervention on quality of life (QOL), fatigue, sleep, and psychological and physical functioning in adults diagnosed with Lymphoma.",
        "A systematic literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PEDro databases was carried out to identify articles published from March 2010 until December 2020. The risk of bias, methodological quality, and level of evidence was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) checklist.",
        "Out of the 577 articles identified from the initial search, a total of 12 randomised control trials were shortlistd for this systematic review. From the 12 articles, 9 studies included participants with Lymphoma who were at various stages of chemotherapy or had completed treatment and 3 studies included participants with various haematological malignancies and had stem cell transplantation. The quality of each study was assessed using the PEDro scale with the a mean score of 6.3\u00b10.89. The PEDro scores regarding the quality of studies ranged from 5-8 (fair to good).",
        "There is moderate evidence strength suggesting that exercises therapy for persons diagnosed with Lymphoma can include aerobic or cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and mind-body exercise has beneficial effects on fatigue, physical performance, and QOL in persons diagnosed with Lymphoma patients.PROSPERO No.: CRD42021227418."
