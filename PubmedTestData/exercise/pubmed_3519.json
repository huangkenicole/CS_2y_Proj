      "AbstractText": [
        "Individuals with a diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) have poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared with healthy individuals. Regular moderate exercise enhances immune function and wellbeing. Whether exercise at recommended levels for the general population is tolerated by individuals diagnosed with PID, without adverse effects, is unknown and warrants investigation.",
        "A prospective randomized preliminary pilot investigation with individuals diagnosed with PID was undertaken; participants were assigned to either an exercise (<i>n</i> =\u00a018) or control group (<i>n</i> =\u00a016). The exercise group completed an eight-week, semi-customized, home-based, moderate intensity exercise program, while the control group engaged in routine activities. Participants completed recall surveys assessing infection rates and non-routine medical care over 8 weeks prior to the eight-week intervention.",
        "Given recruitment issues, the study was underpowered. Thus, as expected, no difference between groups was observed.",
        "This preliminary pilot investigation provides the foundation for a large scale, appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of moderate exercise on infection rates and non-routine medical care for individuals with PID. Recommendations are made to strengthen the methodology of future investigations on the effects of exercise on the immune function and quality of life for individuals diagnosed with PID."
