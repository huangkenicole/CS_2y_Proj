        "To explore the prevalence of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) within community-based exercise programs and to determine the overall impact that participation in community-based exercise programs have on CRF.",
        "Literature searches were performed in March and updated in April of 2020. Studies that were community-based in adult cancer populations and reported CRF outcomes were included. Mean and standard deviations for CRF from 12 studies were extracted in order to compute a pooled effect size via a random effects model. An overall percentage was computed to discern how many community-based exercise programs reported CRF.",
        "Sample sizes varied among studies with most patients being middle-aged with breast cancer in the post-treatment setting. Most programs implemented aerobic + resistance exercise training interventions (~77%). Only ~42% of programs identified in the review reported CRF outcomes. The random effects model produced a pooled effect size of 0.30 (p < 0.001).",
        "Fewer than half of the identified community-based exercise programs reported CRF outcomes (~42%). Of those that did, the random effects model revealed a small yet significant impact on improving CRF after exercise participation, though more research is certainly needed in this area. This review produced promising preliminary evidence for the impact of community-based exercise programs on CRF. As exercise interventions transition to community-based facilities, patients should feel confident that these programs will continue to assist in managing CRF that is commonly experienced across the cancer continuum."
