        "A physically active lifestyle contributes to the prevention of lifestyle diseases, promotion of physical health, and reduction of pain, among other benefits. Being physically active also promotes mental health for many individuals, in the form of improved mood, increased self-efficacy and reduced risk of depression. Alcohol-dependent individuals may experience a better quality of life when supplementing their treatment with physical exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise on Quality of Life among patients with alcohol use disorder in a large randomized controlled trial.",
        "The study had three arms: Patients were allocated to (A) treatment as usual, (B) treatment as usual and supervised group exercise two days a week of one hour each, (C) treatment as usual and individual physical exercise minimum two days a week. Duration of the intervention was six months. Data on values of Quality of Life were collected at baseline (before treatment start and at time of enrollment in the study), and at follow-up (at six months after enrollment in the study) using the EQ-5D questionnaire and the EQ-VAS. The sample consisted of 117 consecutive patients, and the follow-up rate was 66.6%. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of exercise on quality of life.",
        "Although not statistically significant, a substantial portion of the participants in the individual exercise condition reported that they had no pain or discomfort (one of the five quality of life dimensions measured by EQ-5D questionnaire) compared to the controls at follow-up. No difference was found between the groups regarding the EQ-VAS.",
        "The exercise intervention had no effect on quality of life for patients with alcohol use disorder, nor was quality of life improved across the total sample. More research in how to improve quality of life for patients with alcohol use disorder is needed.",
