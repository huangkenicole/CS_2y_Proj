        "This study investigated effects of a 16-week progressive resistance training program (RTP) with elastic bands at two different intensities on systemic redox state, DNA damage, and physical function in healthy older women.",
        "Participants were randomly assigned to the high-intensity group (HIGH; n = 39), moderate-intensity group (MOD; n = 31), or control group (CG; n = 23). The exercise groups performed an RTP twice a week with three to four sets of 6 (HIGH) or 15 (MOD) repetitions of six overall body exercises at a perceived exertion rate of 8-9 on the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale for use with elastic bands. Thiol redox state was determined by reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and GSSG/GSH in blood mononuclear cells. Degree of DNA damage was assessed by presence of the oxidized DNA base molecule 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine. Physical function monitoring was based on the arm curl, chair stand, up and go, and 6-min walk tests.",
        "The HIGH group showed a significant increase in 8-OHdG (+71.07%, effect size [ES] = 1.12) and a significant decrease in GSH (-10.91, ES = -0.69), while the MOD group showed a significant decrease in 8-OHdG levels (-25.66%, ES = -0.69) with no changes in thiol redox state. GSH levels differed significantly between the HIGH and CG groups posttest. The exercise groups showed significant improvements in physical function with no differences between groups.",
        "RTP at a moderate rather than high intensity may be a better strategy to reduce DNA damage in healthy older women while also increasing independence."
