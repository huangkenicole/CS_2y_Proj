      "AbstractText": [
        "To prevent weight regain, patients undergoing weight loss surgery are encouraged to change their exercise and dietary habits. Building on previous research, the aim of this study was to explore women's experiences of changing exercise habits - focusing on women participating in a group based rehabilitation program including surgical as well as non-surgical participants.",
        "Based on interviews with the 11 women included in this study, as well as participant observation, two themes were identified; 1) Pushing ones tolerance limits, and 2) Rebutting the \"quick fix\" fallacy. Taken together, the findings showcase how being a part of this mixed group involved having to relate to social stigmas, as well as notions regarding successful and non-successful surgical outcomes. Although such notions may be useful in identifying potential challenges related to changing exercise habits, they do not illuminate the complexity of undergoing such changes following weight loss surgery.",
        "The findings point to the need of acknowledging patients' own exceriences to determine how successful they are after surgery. Given the findings, I argue for the need to reconsider the notion of success in relation to group based interventions."
