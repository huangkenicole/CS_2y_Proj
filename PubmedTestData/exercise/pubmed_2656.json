        "The purpose of this study was to assess the differences in muscle activation (EMG) and body weight distribution (%BW) between suspension (TRX\u2122 push-up and TRX\u2122 inverted row) and conventional exercises (bench press and lying barbell row) using different contraction types (isometric and isotonic) and position variations (feet on the ground [FG] and feet on suspension device [FD]). It was also used to determine the intensity of the force applied to the straps of the suspension device corresponding to one repetition maximum (1-RM). Twelve male athletes (ages-24.5\u00b14.2 years (mean\u00b1standard deviation [SD]); Height-181.0\u00b16.8 cm; body mass-83.08\u00b16.81 kg) participated in this study. Two suspension devices were used, one for the FD variation and one for the FG variation pectoralis major (PM) and triceps brachii (TRI) activations were assessed during the TRX\u2122 push-up and bench press exercises. Transversus trapezius (TRA) and biceps brachii (BB) activations were assessed during the TRX\u2122 inverted row and lying barbell row exercises. The results showed significant differences between exercises (FG and FD variations of TRX\u2122 push-up and bench press) in PM activities (isometric and isotonic) (p\u22640.05). However, these differences were only observed during isometric TRI activation (p\u22640.05). In the FG and FD variations of the TRX\u2122 inverted row and lying barbell row exercises, there were only differences in the isometric contractions of the TRA and BB (p\u22640.05). In the suspension device of push-ups and inverted row for the FD variations, 70.5% and 72.64% of 1-RM intensity were obtained, respectively. Similar responses to training intensities and muscle activations can be obtained in suspension exercises and conventional exercises. FD variations of suspension exercises can be more effective in terms of muscle activations than FG variations, and isotonic suspension exercises increase exercise intensity more than isometric suspension exercises."
