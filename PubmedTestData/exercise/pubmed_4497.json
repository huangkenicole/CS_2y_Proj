        "Physical activity is a common adjunctive therapy in psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals. In the present study, we assessed the effects of an exercise program, integrated into routine inpatient treatment, on cognitive performance and subjective severity of depression in a sample of patients suffering from major depression. We randomized n = 38 patients with unipolar depression to either physical exercise (n = 18) or occupational therapy as an active control treatment (n = 20). Both treatments were delivered in group format over a period of 3-4 weeks. Data indicate that there were significant improvements of cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in both groups, with specific treatment effects in reaction time and in short-term verbal memory favoring the physical activity group. In conclusion, we found physical exercise to be a feasible, easy-to-implement add-on therapy for depressive patients with promising effects on cognitive performance. However, these results need to be replicated in larger samples with an extended follow-up."
