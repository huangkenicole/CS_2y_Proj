        "Many problems that fall in medical domains of inquiry have behavioral components that can be optimized to increase benefits for patients. For example, although surgical intervention is effective in reducing the pain resulting from osteoarthritis of the knee, patients often struggle to regain complete functional use of the joint. In this translational study, we point to some ways in which behavioral contingencies of reinforcement are compromised, making the recovery process more difficult. We also report on the use of surface electromyography (sEMG) with healthy participants to create supplementary contingencies of reinforcement to support the development and maintenance of clinically relevant exercises. The procedures reported provide a proof-of-concept and can contribute to an increase in the systematic use of games and feedback in physical rehabilitation in recovery from knee surgery. The results of this translational study suggest an expanded role for applied behavior analysis in the domains of health and medicine."
