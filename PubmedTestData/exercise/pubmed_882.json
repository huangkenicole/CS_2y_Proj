        "Physical inactivity in older adults is associated with declining functional capacity, sarcopenia, metabolic changes, and cognitive changes. Current Physical Activity Guidelines recommend 150\u200amin of moderate-intensity exercise along with strengthening and balance exercises. Despite the guidelines there is little evidence of a population-based change in physical activity.",
        "There is a growing body of research investigating the use of high-intensity interval training in older adult to improve health-related outcomes. Research indicates that high-intensity interval training confers greater benefit than moderate-intensity exercise and is acceptable and safe for older adults and those with various noncommunicable diseases.",
        "A major challenge to health systems is the growing number of people surviving into older age, many of whom have more than one noncommunicable disease. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for the development of noncommunicable diseases. Increasing participation in physical activity interventions, particularly those at a high intensity, appears to be a safe and feasible approach to reducing the demand on healthcare systems into the future."
