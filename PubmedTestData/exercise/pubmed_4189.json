        "High rates of disease- and treatment-related symptoms, such as bone lesions, in people with multiple myeloma (MM) create uncertainty on the safety and feasibility of exercise. This study determined the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of an individualized exercise medicine program for people with MM at any disease stage.",
        "A multisite, randomized waitlist-controlled trial was conducted of an individualized, high-intensity aerobic, resistance, and impact-loading exercise program. The exercise sessions were supervised twice weekly by accredited exercise physiologists, with one additional unsupervised session per week, for 12 wk. Safety was determined by number of adverse and serious adverse events. Feasibility outcome measures were study eligibility, recruitment, adherence, and attrition. Acceptability was determined by qualitative interviews and subjective levels of enjoyment.",
        "Of 203 people with MM screened, 88% were eligible, with 34% accepting participation (60 people) and 20% attrition for the between-group analysis, meeting a priori criteria (\u226525% and <25%, respectively). No adverse or serious adverse events attributed to testing and/or exercise training were reported. Attendance at supervised exercise sessions was 98%, with 45% completion of the home-based exercise sessions. Adherence rates were 35%, 63%, and 34% for the aerobic, resistance, and impact-loading protocols, with 55%, 80%, and 37% of participants meeting a priori criteria (75% of protocol). Acceptability of the exercise program was high (mean, 82%; 95% confidence interval, 78%-87%) and highly supported by qualitative responses.",
        "An individualized, high-intensity aerobic, resistance, and impact-loading exercise medicine program is safe and acceptable, and feasible by some measures for people with MM. Adherence to the prescribed exercise protocols was limited by comorbidities and disease symptoms. Strategies to improve unsupervised exercise completion are warranted in this population."
