        "This systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies aimed to assess the efficacy of different types of exercise programs (EP) on ankylosing spondylitis (AS) activity, function and mobility.",
        "We searched PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase databases for reports of controlled trials of patients with AS published up to May 2022. The studies were classified by intervention into categories defined by the 4 exercise domains established by the American College of Sports Medicine and then adopted by the European League Against Rheumatism: aerobic, muscle strength, flexibility, neuromotor performance.",
        "We found a moderate effect of EP as a whole on BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) (-0.60, 95% CI -0.95, -0.25, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), BASFI (Functional) (-0.63, 95% CI -0.84, -0.42, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and BASMI (Metrology) (-0.52, 95% CI -0.88, -0.15, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). The effect of \"flexibility\u2009+\u2009muscle strength\" EP was large for BASMI, moderate for BASDAI and BASFI. The effect of \"flexibility\u2009+\u2009muscle strength\u2009+\u2009aerobic\" EP was large for BASFI, moderate for BASDAI.",
        "EP, regardless of the specific type of exercise, have a moderate effect on AS activity, function and mobility. EP including flexibility and muscle strength exercises may have a large effect, especially for mobility. Programs including aerobic exercise showed significant efficacy for function.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONIn ankylosing spondylitis (AS), any exercise program (EP), regardless of the type of exercises involved, showed a moderate effect on disease activity, function and spinal mobility.In AS, EP combining flexibility and strength exercises showed the largest effect on spinal mobility and should be encouraged.In AS, EP combining flexibility, muscle strength and aerobic exercises may be particularly effective on patient function."
