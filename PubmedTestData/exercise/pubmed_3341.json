      "AbstractText": [
        "After a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), dizziness and balance problems are frequently reported, affecting individuals' daily lives and functioning. Vestibular rehabilitation is a standard treatment approach for addressing these issues, but its efficacy in this population remains inconclusive. A potential reason for suboptimal outcomes is the lack of objective monitoring of exercise performance, which is crucial for therapeutic success. This study utilized wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) to quantify exercise performance in individuals with mTBI during home-based vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Seventy-three people with mTBI and fifty healthy controls were enrolled. Vestibular exercises were performed, and IMUs measured forehead and sternum velocities and range of motions. The mTBI group demonstrated a slower forehead peak angular velocity in all exercises, which may be a compensatory strategy to manage balance issues or symptom exacerbation. Additionally, the mTBI group exhibited a larger forehead range of motion during specific exercises, potentially linked to proprioceptive deficits. These findings emphasize the usefulness of utilizing IMUs to monitor the quality of home-based vestibular exercises for individuals with mTBI and the potential for IMUs improving rehabilitation outcomes."
