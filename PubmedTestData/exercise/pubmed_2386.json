        "<i>Background</i>: The proportion of frailty in older adults is increasing in many countries. Demand for institutional long-term care followed by an increasing globally. <i>Aims</i>: The effects of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) interventions on frail older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) of randomized controlled trials. <i>Design</i>: A literature searches of the published articles indexed in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Google Scholar between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. <i>Methods</i>: The inclusion criteria were divided into four sections: (1) design: randomized controlled trials; (2) sample population: LTCF adults aged 60 years or over with frailty; (3) intervention: LTPA; and (4) body composition: physical, functional or neuropsychological tests as either the primary or the secondary outcomes. <i>Results</i>: Three main themes were identified (the particular monitor, intervention duration and outcome measurement dimensions). <i>Impact statement and conclusions</i>: LTPA interventions effectively improved the physical performance and body composition of frail older adults in LTCFs. Nevertheless, an optimal combination of intensity, duration and frequency is crucial."
