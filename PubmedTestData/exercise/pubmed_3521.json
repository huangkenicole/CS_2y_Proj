        "Lumbar stability exercise promotes deep muscle functions, and it is an effective intervention method for increasing proprioceptive sensation. This study aims to explore and compare the effects of lumbar stability exercise with respiratory resistance and whole body vibration on patients with lumbar instability.",
        "This study is a 3-group randomized control trial. Through screening tests, 48 patients with lumbar instability were selected and randomly assigned to SE group (n = 16), stabilization exercise program using respiratory resistance (SER) group (n = 16), and stabilization exercise program using respiratory resistance and whole body vibration (SERW) group (n = 16). In order to compare the effects depending on the intervention methods, quadruple visual analogue scale (QVAS), Functional Ability Roland-Morris low back pain and disability questionnaire ([RMDQ], center of pressure path length, velocity, and area), Korean version of fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire, and Pulmonary Function were used for measurement.",
        "All of the groups showed significant improvements in QVAS, RMDQ, Korean version of fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire, and balance abilities before and after the interventions. The SER group and SERW group showed a significant difference in QVAS and RMDQ than the SE group (P < .05). In addition, balance ability showed a significant difference in SERW group (P < .05), where only the SER group showed a significant difference in pulmonary function indexes including forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, maximum inspiratory pressure, and maximum expiratory pressure (P < .05).",
        "Stabilization exercise program using respiratory resistance and whole-body vibration administered according to the purpose of intervention methods may be effective exercise programs for people with lumbar instability."
