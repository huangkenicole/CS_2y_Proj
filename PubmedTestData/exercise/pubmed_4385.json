        "We aimed to investigate the effects of exercise based on a specific protocol on the severity and duration of primary dysmenorrhea in students residing in dormitories of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, western Iran in 2017.",
        "Randomized controlled trial study.",
        "Overall, 86 students (43 in the interventional group and 43 in the control group) with mild to moderate dysmenorrhea were enrolled. The exercise based on the FITT protocol (Intensity of exercise, time of exercise, and type of exercise) was implemented for the interventional group in 8 weeks. The McGill Pain scale was used to determine the severity of pain in dysmenorrhea. Duration of pain was calculated in terms of the day. Research data were analyzed using SPSS 20 and the significance level was considered 0.05.",
        "The mean dysmenorrhea severity in the first menstrual cycle after the intervention in intervention group was significantly lower than the control group (3.06 (1.78) and 4.74 (2.14), respectively) and in the second menstrual cycle (2.01 (1.54) and 4.61 (2.01) respectively) (P<0.001). The mean duration of dysmenorrhea in the first menstrual cycle after the intervention in intervention group was less than the control group (1.29 (0.92) and 2.32 (1.26) respectively) P<0.001) and in the second menstrual cycle (0.94 (0.93) and 2.13 (1.24) respectively) P<0.001).",
