        "To examine trends in type, frequency, and effectiveness of different modes of exercise in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD).",
        "Exercise has been shown to improve symptoms in PD patients. Recent studies suggest that dance may be a particularly helpful exercise option. However, it remains unclear how the benefits of various forms of exercise compare to dance and to each other. Information on these trends can help inform future exercise programs for PD patients.",
        "55 PD patients completed a survey on their exercise frequency, the impact of exercise on their symptoms, and whether they exercise alone or in groups. 9 PD patients who attend dance therapy classes completed an extended survey with additional questions comparing the benefit of dance therapy to traditional forms of exercise.",
        "Of the 64 patients surveyed, 67% of patients exercised at least twice a week for at least 30\u202fminutes at a time, and 28% of patients exercised alone only. Walking was most commonly reported (77%), followed by stretching (52%), and weights (28%). 97% of patients who exercised noted mitigation of their PD symptoms. Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients who exercised in groups reported symptomatic improvements compared to patients who only exercised alone (p\u202f=\u202f0.03).",
        "More patients who participated in group exercise reported symptomatic improvement compared to those who exercised strictly alone. This suggests that the psychosocial and cognitive component of group therapy, such as dance, may confer additional benefits to PD patients."
