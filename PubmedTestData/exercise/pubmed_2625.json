        "Robot-assisted gait training using a voluntary-driven wearable cyborg, Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL), has been shown to improve the mobility of patients with neurological disorders; however, its effect on the quality of life (QOL) of patients is not clear. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of HAL-assisted gait training on QOL and mobility in patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). Ten patients with NMDs (seven men and three women, mean age: 57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0years), with impairment in mobility but could walk alone with aids underwent two courses of gait training with HAL over 6\u00a0months, and the single course consisted of nine sessions of training for 4\u00a0weeks. We compared the findings of the 2\u00a0min walk test, 10\u00a0m walk test, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline, after the 1st training, before the 2nd training, and after the 2nd training using the Friedman test. A significant improvement was observed in the 2\u00a0min walking distance from baseline (93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0m) to after the 2nd training (115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0m, P\u00a0=\u00a00.034), as well as in the domains of vitality (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and mental component summary score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019) of SF-36. The improvement in 10\u00a0m walking speed was significantly correlated with that in the physical functioning (R\u00a0=\u00a00.831, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and role physical (R\u00a0=\u00a00.697, P\u00a0=\u00a00.025) domains in the SF-36. Our findings suggest that HAL-assisted gait training is effective in improving QOL associated with mental health as well as gait ability in selected patients with NMDs."
