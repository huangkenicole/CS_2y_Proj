      "AbstractText": [
        "Stress fractures (SFx) of the tibia are common and limit military readiness, but there is presently no scientifically validated program that objectively fosters tibia SFx rehabilitation. Therefore, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a Graduated Exercise Program (GEP) based on the theory that programmed rest between exercise bouts improves the osteogenic response, which may enhance rehabilitation and military readiness.",
        "Participants were randomly assigned to the GEP or standard-of-care exercise program. Both programs use a walk-jog-run progression, but the GEP splits daily exercise into morning and evening episodes and provides 5 days of programmed rest after each stage is completed. The GEP included autonomy support to foster program adherence. Outcome measures included adherence, subjective and ActiGraph-validated objective assessments of exercise duration and intensity, pain assessments, and autonomy support assessments. Participants offered suggestions for program improvement.",
        "Quantitative findings were mixed, but more importantly, this pilot study showed that the measurement, support, and self-reporting parameters were feasible, with high compliance by participants. Barriers to recruitment and retention were identified, along with solutions to overcome these barriers, starting with obtaining unit support for GEP participation.",
        "This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a GEP with autonomy support, along with challenges and their solutions, providing the foundation for a formal large-sample study."
