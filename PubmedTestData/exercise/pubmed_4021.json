        "To examine gluteus medius (GMed) muscle activity while performing standing hip abduction exercise in the transverse plane at different angles.",
        "Muscle activity of both sides of the GMed was measured by electromyography (EMG) with a sampling frequency of 1,500 Hz. Participants were asked to perform standing hip abduction exercise in the transverse plane at different angles including 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degr Percent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of average EMG of GMed muscles was reportedfrom three trials for each limb. Repeated-measure ANOVA was used to analyze the data.",
        "Nine healthy volunteers were included in the present study. The finding indicated that angle of hip motion in the transverse plane significantly (p<0.05) affects GMed muscle activity of swing and stance limbs. Standing hip abduction exercise at 30 degrees in the transverse plane was observed to produce the highest EMG ofswing limb (64.68% MVIC) than other angles. In stance limb, a decreasing trend of GMed muscle activity while performing standing hip abduction exercise was noted from 0 degree to 90 degres in the transverse plane, respectively.",
        "GMed muscle activities ofswing and stance limbs during hip abduction exercise exhibited the highest EMG at 30 degrees and 0 degrees in the transverse plane, respectively. Therefore, these exercises of GMed muscle could be suggested for early rehabilitation. Standing exercises with 0 degrees and 30 degrees hip abductions might be suitable for weight bearing and non-weight bearing purposes."
