        "All participants received a 12-week home-based exercise program. An intervention group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200933) received a 5-10\u2005min buddy-style intervention once a week at an adult day-care center for older adults.",
        "The primary outcome was the average daily time spent performing \"walking outside home\" and \"muscle strength exercises\" at 24 weeks follow-up post-intervention.",
        "Of the 65 participants, one participant in each group dropped out before the program began, 4 and 5 in the intervention and control groups by the 12-week assessment, and 4 and 3 by the 24-week assessment, respectively. Analysis of covariance of the 47 participants who were able to be assessed after 24 weeks revealed that outdoor walking time (min/day) was significantly longer in the intervention group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200924) than in the control group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200923) at 24 weeks (intervention group, 73.5 [66.1]; control group, 42.7 [45.5]; <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.030, <i>f</i>\u2009=\u20090.38). There was no significant difference in the duration of muscle strength exercises (min/day) between the two groups at 24 weeks (intervention group, 8.2 [9.7]; control group, 6.5 [9.3]; <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.593, <i>f</i>\u2009=\u20090.08).",
        "The buddy-style intervention increased the duration of outdoor walking, with a sustained effect up to 12 weeks after the end of the intervention."
