        "The Pilates exercise has recently become an increasingly popular way of exercise in female patients since it is an attractive and low-cost physical exercise modality. Pilates may be a beneficial method of exercise for female patients with depression and anxiety symptoms. However, to date, there has been no attempt to collate this literature. This review aims to systematically assess and meta-analyze the efficacy of Pilates exercise for female patients with depression and anxiety symptoms and inform evidence-based guidelines for exercise prescription.",
        "Five electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched up to January 2023 to examine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on the effects of Pilates exercise for female patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression were included. The primary outcomes were the severity of depression, and the secondary outcomes were anxiety. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 software with a 95% confidence interval (Registration number: CRD42023426522), and the PEDRO Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias for RCT.",
        "18 RCTs with 827 female patients were included. The methodological quality of the RCTs was considered an A level in 4 studies, B level in 13, studies, and C level in 1 study investigation. The meta-analysis showed that there was moderate evidence for the Pilates exercise significantly improved the severity of depression symptoms (SMD\u2005=\u2005-0.73; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.59; P\u2005<\u2005.01) and anxiety symptoms (SMD\u2005=\u2005-0.62; 95% CI -0.79 to -0.46; P\u2005<\u2005.01).",
        "Pilates exercise could reduce levels of depression and anxiety in female patients with depression and anxiety symptoms. Pilates exercise can be used as a potential ancillary program to improve depression and anxiety symptoms for female patients."
