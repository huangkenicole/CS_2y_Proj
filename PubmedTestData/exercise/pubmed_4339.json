        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative pathology that affects\u00a0young people in the prime of their\u00a0lives, often having an impact on motor tasks such as walking, which subsequently affects participation in daily activities. The symptoms caused by MS are highly variable, and rehabilitation strategies, which often focus on movements and exercises to improve symptoms or function, are variable in\u00a0success.",
        "The aim of this article is to summarise how motor and non-motor symptoms have an impact on walking ability in people with MS, and how this impact may vary across disability levels.",
        "A variety of motor and non-motor symptoms are common in people with MS early after diagnosis, but they vary in their impact on walking, and this differs by disability level. A comprehensive assessment of all symptoms is required to understand contributors to walking disability and thus direct targeted non-pharmacological management options."
