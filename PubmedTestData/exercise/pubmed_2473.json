        "Regular Nordic Walking training could improve fitness and reduce tenderness in selected muscle groups in office workers.",
        "An assessment of the effects of a 12-week Nordic Walking training program on the perceived pain threshold (PPT) and the flexibility of selected upper-body muscle groups in postmenopausal female office workers.",
        "39 office workers were selected at random for the treatment group (NWg, n\u200a=\u200a20) and the control group (Cg, n\u200a=\u200a19). The persons from the NW group completed a 12-week Nordic Walking training program (3 times a week/1 hour). PPTs measurements in selected muscles and functional tests evaluating upper-body flexibility (Back Scratch - BS) were carried out twice in every participant of the study: before and after the training program.",
        "A significant increase in PPT (kg/cm2) was observed in the following muscles in the NW group only: upper trapezius (from 1,32\u200akg/cm2 to 1,99\u200akg/cm2), mid trapezius (from 2,92\u200akg/cm2 to 3,30\u200akg/cm2), latissimus dorsi (from 1,66\u200akg/cm2 to 2,21\u200akg/cm2) and infraspinatus (from 1,63\u200akg/cm2 to 2,93\u200akg/cm2). Moreover, a significant improvement in the BS test was noted in the NW group compared with the control group (from -1,16\u00b15,7\u200acm to 2,18\u00b15,1\u200acm in the NW group vs from -2,52\u00b16,1 to -2,92\u00b16,2 in the control group).",
