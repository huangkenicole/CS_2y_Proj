        "The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined aerobic and strength training in adults with hypertension and the influence of exercise training characteristics on blood pressure (BP) reduction.",
        "Randomized clinical trials of interventions involving combined aerobic and strength training versus nonexercise control groups (Control) in adults with hypertension were included. The literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus, and LILACS until December 2021. A random effects meta-analysis was performed using the mean difference in BP changes from baseline, comparing combined aerobic and strength training vs. Control as the effective measure. A multivariate meta-regression analysis was also performed to evaluate the relationship between exercise training characteristics and magnitudes of BP reductions.",
        "Thirty-seven studies with 41 exercise interventions (1942 participants) were analyzed. The pooled mean differences with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) showed significant reductions in SBP (-6.4\u200ammHg; 95% CI, -9.1 to -3.6) and DBP (-3.7\u200ammHg; 95% CI, -4.9 to -2.4). Meta-regression analysis revealed that greater exercise intensity and a greater number of sets in resistance training were associated with greater reductions in SBP. Greater exercise intensity was also associated with greater decreases in DBP.",
        "Combined aerobic and resistance training is an effective intervention in reducing both SBP and DBP in adults with hypertension, with greater hypotensive effects expected with higher intensity and more volume."
