        "Poor sleep and chronic fatigue are common in people with chronic stroke (i.e. \u2265\u20096\u00a0months post-stroke). Exercise training is a viable, low-cost therapy for promoting sleep and reducing fatigue; however, the effects of exercise on sleep and fatigue in people with chronic stroke are unclear. Thus, we conducted a systematic review ascertaining the effects of exercise on sleep and fatigue in people with chronic stroke. We systematically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, AgeLine, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, SCOPUS, and reference lists of relevant reviews for articles that examined the effects of exercise on sleep or fatigue in chronic stroke. Search results were limited to adults \u2265\u200918\u2009years, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials, and pre-post studies, which were published in English and examined the effects of exercise on sleep or fatigue in people with chronic stroke. We extracted study characteristics and information on the measurement of sleep and fatigue, and assessed study quality and risk of bias using the CONSORT criteria and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, respectively. We found two studies that examined the effects of exercise on sleep, and two that examined the effects of exercise on fatigue. All studies reported positive effects of exercise training on sleep and fatigue; however, there were concerns of bias and study quality in all studies. There is preliminary evidence that exercise promotes sleep and reduces fatigue in people with chronic stroke; however, the extent to which exercise impacts these health parameters is unclear."
