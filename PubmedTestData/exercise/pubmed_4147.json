        "Increased physical activity is an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis that causes knee pain. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019, noncontact and non-face-to-face interventions have increased, but the quality of evidence supporting their effectiveness remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to assess the quality of evidence of the effects of non-face-to-face and noncontact interventions on knee pain and physical activity in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effects of different intervention methods (education and exercise). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database were systematically searched. Four randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the educational intervention group was significantly effective, although supportive evidence was low quality. Educational intervention may be effective, but the effects need to be confirmed by higher quality clinical trials."
