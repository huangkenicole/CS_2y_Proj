        "Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain. Monitoring therapy effects is challenging with conventional B-mode ultrasound. Shear wave elastography (SWE) provides important diagnostic information beyond B-mode, with typically lower tissue stiffness in symptomatic plantar fascia. Up to now little is known about SWE features for therapy monitoring in plantar fasciitis. We evaluated the clinical effects of a 3-month physical therapy based treatment and its influence on B-mode and SWE ultrasound findings in patients suffering from plantar fasciitis, correlating ultrasound findings to score-based symptom development.",
        "Prospective, IRB-approved clinical study in plantar fasciitis patients undergoing a 3-month physical therapy based treatment. Measurement time points were before (T0), after 1 (T1) and 3 (T2) months of treatment, consisting of clinical orthopedic (FFI, AOFAS-Score) and multimodal radiologic sonographic examinations (B-mode/SWE) using a high-resolution linear 18-MHz probe.",
        "A total of 33 patients with 43 symptomatic plantar fascia were included. We found a significant (P<0.001) clinical score improvement (AOFAS +14, FFI-Pain -21, FFI-Function -18) between T0 and T2. Mean initial thickness (T0) of symptomatic plantar fascia was 4.2 (\u00b11.2) mm, compared to 3.2 (\u00b10.7) mm at the asymptomatic contralateral side (P<0.001). No significant thickness changes were seen at T1 (4.2\u00b11.1 mm) and T2 (4.5\u00b11.3 mm), even though clinical scores improved significantly. Mean initial stiffness (T0) of symptomatic plantar fascia was 59.57 (\u00b143.3) kPa, compared to 83.23 (\u00b147.3) kPa at the asymptomatic contralateral side (P<0.001). In contrast to B-mode ultrasound, SWE values increased significantly between T0 (59.6\u00b143.3 kPa), T1 (82.6\u00b147.3 kPa) and T2 (102.5\u00b147.2 kPa) (P<0.001-0.009), with positive correlations for AOFAS/FFI-Pain/Function scores (r=0.285-0.473, P<0.001-0.002).",
        "A physical therapy based treatment relieves plantar fasciitis symptoms during a 3-month period. In line with symptom reduction, stiffness (Young's-moduli) of plantar fascia increased significantly, while B-mode ultrasound revealed no measurable changes during the healing process. Shear wave elastography was able to quantify plantar fascia pathologies and their recovery under therapy."
