        "This pilot pre-and post-intervention study investigated the effects of a short-term aquatic exercise programme on physiological outcomes, symptoms and exercise capacity in women with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME).",
        "Eleven women (54.8\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4\u00a0year) volunteered for the 5-week program; an initial 20-min aquatic exercise session then two self-paced 20-min sessions per week for 4\u00a0weeks. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes were physiological measures, 6\u00a0min Walk Test (6MWT), perceived exertion (RPE), hand grip strength, Sit-to-Stand, Sit-Reach test, Apley's shoulder test, FACIT questionnaire, and 24-h post-test tiredness and pain scores (0-10 visual analogue scale). Heart rates, RPE, 24- and 48-h post-session tiredness/pain scores were recorded each session.",
        "6MWT distance increased by 60.8\u00a0m (p\u2009=\u20090.006), left hand grip strength by 6\u00a0kg (p\u2009=\u20090.038), Sit-Reach test by 4.0\u00a0cm (p\u2009=\u20090.017), right shoulder flexibility by 2.9\u00a0cm (p\u2009=\u20090.026), FACIT scores by 8.2 (p\u2009=\u20090.041); 24-h post-test tiredness and pain decreased by 1.5 and 1.6, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.002). There were significant post-intervention increases in exercising heart rates (6MWT 4- and 6-min time points), oxygen saturation at 2-min, and reduced RPE at 4-min. Weekly resting and exercising heart rates increased significantly during the study but RPE decreased; immediately post- and 24-h post-session tiredness decreased significantly. There were no reports of symptom exacerbation.",
        "Five weeks of low-moderate intensity aquatic exercise significantly improved exercise capacity, RPE and fatigue. This exercise mode exercise may potentially be a manageable and safe physical activity for CFS/ME patients."
