        "The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an exercise program to improve maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2 max)) in untrained patients with migraine without making their migraines worse.",
        "Twenty-six patients were studied at a headache clinic in Sweden. The exercise program, based on indoor cycling, was performed 3 times per week during 12 weeks. VO(2 max), migraine status, side effects, and quality of life were evaluated.",
        "VO(2 max) increased from 32.9 mL/kg/minute to 36.2 mL/kg/minute (P = .044). Quality of life increased and significant improvements in migraine status (attack frequency, symptom intensity, and intake of medicine) were seen. During the 12 weeks of exercise, on one occasion one patient had a migraine attack, which started immediately after training. No other side effects were reported.",
        "The evaluated exercise program was well tolerated by the patients and improved their VO(2 max) with no deterioration of migraine status."
