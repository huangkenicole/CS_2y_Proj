        "Exercise can decrease fall risk in older adults but less is known about training to reduce injury risk in the event a fall is unavoidable. The purpose of this study was to compare standard fall prevention exercises to novel Fall Arrest Strategy Training (<i>FAST</i>); exercises designed to improve upper body capacity to reduce fall-injury risk in older women.",
        "Forty women (mean age 74.5 years) participated in either Standard (n\u2009=\u200919) or <i>FAST</i> (n\u2009=\u200921) twice per week for 12 weeks. Both interventions included lower body strength, balance, walking practice, agility and education. <i>FAST</i> added exercises designed to enhance forward landing and descent control such as upper body strengthening, speed and practice of landing and descent on outstretched hands.",
        "Both <i>FAST</i> and Standard significantly improved strength, mobility, balance, and fall risk factors from pre to post-intervention. There was a significant time by group interaction effect for upper body response time where <i>FAST</i> improved but Standard did not (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.038).",
        "<i>FAST</i> resulted in similar gains in factors that reduce fall risk as a standard fall prevention program; with the additional benefit of improving speed of arm protective responses; a factor that may help enhance landing position and reduce injury risks such as head impact during a forward fall."
