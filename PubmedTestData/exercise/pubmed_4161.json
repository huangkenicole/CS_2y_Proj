        "This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the effect of different types of physical exercise [endurance training, endurance/resistance training, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)] on exercise capacity and cardiac function parameters in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",
        "A systematic search of the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify experimental studies addressing the effect of different physical exercise training programmes on exercise capacity and cardiac function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Comparative evaluation of the effect of exercise training type was performed by conducting a standard pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis for direct and indirect comparisons between exercise training types and controls/non-interventions. Eleven studies were included in the analysis showing that endurance training improves the main exercise capacity parameters (VO2peak, workload, exercise time, peak heart rate, VO2, and 6 min walk distance). Additionally, endurance/resistance training showed a significant effect on VO2peak, workload, early mitral annulus velocity, and early mitral/mitral annulus velocity ratio. Finally, HIIT showed a significant effect on VO2peak, VO2, and the early mitral/mitral annulus velocity ratio.",
        "Our findings support the effect of three different types of physical exercise on exercise capacity, mainly VO2peak. Additionally, endurance/resistance training and HIIT could reverse left ventricular remodelling in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",
