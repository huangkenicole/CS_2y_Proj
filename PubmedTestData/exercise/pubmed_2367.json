        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different physical therapy programs on physical activity, grip strength, and psychoemotional status of individuals who had undergone renal transplant and to determine the associations between these indices. The study included 32 individuals who had undergone renal transplant; the subjects were distributed into 2 groups, each consisting of 16 individuals. Group 1 received a physical therapy program involving aerobic exercises, and group 2 received a physical therapy program involving Pilates exercises. During the study, physical activity was evaluated using the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Grip strength in the hands was evaluated with a dynamometer. Psychoemotional status was evaluated by applying the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy programs, we assessed changes in physical activity, grip strength, and psychoemotional status, and the associations between these indices. The evaluation of changes in physical activity, grip strength, and psychoemotional status when applying different physical therapy programs showed a significant change in these indices in both groups. The study also showed that both physical therapy programs had equal effect on the analyzed indices. The evaluation of the association between physical activity and grip strength showed a direct weak correlation between physical activity and grip strength in the left and right hands, a moderate inverse correlation between the level of physical activity and the severity of anxiety, and an inverse correlation between time after renal transplant and the severity of anxiety. In addition, we found a direct strong correlation between physical activity and its other domains and an inverse correlation between physical activity and the duration of sitting (min/wk)."
