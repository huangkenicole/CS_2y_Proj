        "The goal of the study is to determine the effect of pelvic floor muscle exercises on genito-pelvic pain levels during the postpartum period.",
        "The data of the study, which was carried out in a randomized controlled experimental design, were collected in the antenatal policlinic of a public hospital from June-December 2019. There were 60 pregnant women in the experimental and control groups. Pelvic floor muscle exercises were applied to the pregnant women in the experimental group from the 30th week of gestation to the 6th week postpartum. The control group was not given pelvic floor muscle exercise training, and only data collection forms were filled in. During the study, the Descriptive Form, Verbal Category Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20, and Labour and Postpartum Information Form were given to the pregnant women in both groups.",
        "After pregnant women in the experimental group performed pelvic floor muscle exercises, pain levels were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.01). Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 total score and sub-dimension scores of the experimental group were statistically significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.01). In addition, a statistically significant difference was found (p < 0.01) in the postpartum 72 h findings of the experimental group in which pelvic floor muscle exercises were applied compared to the control group.",
        "According to the result of the study, as the gestational weeks progress, the genito-pelvic pain increases. Pelvic floor muscle exercises applied during pregnancy prevent the development and progression of pelvic floor disorders in both the antenatal and postnatal periods.",
