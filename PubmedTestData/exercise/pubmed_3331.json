        "This 6-month experimental case series study investigated the effects of a dual-task gait training and aerobic exercise intervention on cognition, mobility, and cardiovascular health in community-dwelling older adults without dementia. Participants exercised 40\u200amin/day, 3 days/week for 26 weeks on a Biodex GaitTrainer2 treadmill. Participants were assessed at baseline (V0), interim (V1: 12-weeks), intervention endpoint (V2: 26-weeks), and study endpoint (V3: 52-weeks). The study outcomes included: cognition [executive function (EF), processing speed, verbal fluency, and memory]; mobility: usual & dual-task gait (speed, step length, and stride time variability); and vascular health: ambulatory blood pressure, carotid arterial compliance, and intima-media thickness (cIMT). Fifty-six participants [age: 70(6) years; 61% female] were included in this study. Significant improvements following the exercise program (V2) were observed in cognition: EF (p\u200a=\u200a0.002), processing speed (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), verbal fluency [digit symbol coding (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), phonemic verbal fluency (p\u200a<\u200a0.001)], and memory [immediate recall (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and delayed recall (p\u200a<\u200a0.001)]; mobility: usual & dual-task gait speed (p\u200a=\u200a0.002 and p\u200a<\u200a0.001, respectively) and step length (p\u200a=\u200a0.001 and p\u200a=\u200a0.003, respectively); and vascular health: cIMT (p\u200a=\u200a0.002). No changes were seen in the remaining outcomes. In conclusion, 26 weeks of dual-task gait training and aerobic exercise improved performance on a number of cognitive outcomes, while increasing usual & dual-task gait speed and step length in a sample of older adults without dementia."
