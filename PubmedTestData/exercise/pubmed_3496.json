        "Decreased range of motion is a common secondary complication of motor neuron disease (MND) that can contribute to functional decline and decreased participation in daily activities.",
        "The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the effectiveness of educational brochures and videos aimed at improving knowledge regarding the importance of a regular stretching program.",
        "This was a quality improvement (QI) project.",
        "Participants were seen in an outpatient multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic.",
        "Individuals with motor neuron disease were invited to participate in this QI study.",
        "Individuals were asked to complete surveys asking questions regarding current stretching program, pain levels, and knowledge of benefits of stretching before and after receiving the stretching brochures or videos.",
        "A total of 53 participants completed the pre-intervention survey, 28 in the brochure group and 25 in the video group. Of those, 86% and 88% completed the post-intervention survey in the brochure and video groups, respectively. The video group increased stretching frequency significantly more than the brochure group (2.04 and 0.62 days/week respectively, P=0.004). Significantly more participants in the video group reported usage of stretches from the educational materials on a regular basis (54% for brochure group and 86% for video group, P=0.024).",
        "Educational brochures and videos are two different strategies to improve knowledge of benefits of stretching for individuals with MND. Both groups increased frequency of stretching. Videos may be better able to improve frequency of stretching when compared to brochures.",
        "The brochures and videos developed for this study can be used by clinicians treating individuals with MND. By improving knowledge regarding the benefits of stretching, individuals with MND may choose to prioritize stretching as a part of their routine. This in turn may help to prevent or address potential joint or muscle length issues or assist patients to incorporate preventative measures into their treatment plans."
