        "Osteoarthritis is a condition commonly present in the elderly, with many having altered balance, aggravated with weak lower limb and core musculature predisposing them to falls. Despite the knowledge about the link between balance and core stability, studies investigating the importance of core stability exercise and their impact on balance are limited. Therefore, the authors aimed to explore whether core strengthening exercises in combination with hip exercises, when compared to a hip exercise programme and a control group, led to better improvements in balance in patients with hip osteoarthritis. In order to meet these aims, this paper reports the outcomes of a randomized, three-arm parallel, assessor-blinded, controlled clinical trial. Fifty-one participants awaiting a total hip replacement were recruited into this study. All patients were randomly allocated to a control, hip exercise group and hip and core exercise group. All participants were assessed for core muscle strength using a pressure biofeedback unit and balance using the four-stage balance test. The control group had no intervention. A 12-week hip and core exercise programme did not result in improvements over and above the hip exercise group in balance scores. However an improvement in core stability was noted for the hip and core exercise group ( P \u2005=\u20050.001). Therefore, this study concluded that both exercise groups are resulted in improved balance with the core and hip exercise group noted to have added improvements, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant."
