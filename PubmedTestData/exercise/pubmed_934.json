        "To investigate the effects of ultrasonic evaluation of a progressive yoga exercise program on reducing the inter-recti distance (IRD) among women in the early postpartum period. Postpartum women (<i>n</i> = 116), free of obstetric complications and in recovery following vaginal delivery between weeks 1 and 12, were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to the control and yoga exercise group in the pre- and post-intervention design. The control group received no treatment, while the yoga exercise group participated in a guided 12-week progressive yoga exercise program started at postpartum week 1. The IRD was examined using high-frequency ultrasound at postpartum weeks 6 and 12. The results showed that the supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical IRD were significantly decreased in the yoga exercise group after the 12-week progressive yoga exercise intervention compared with the first (week 6) and second (week 12) measurements. The differences in IRD at supraumbilical, umbilical, and subumbilical intervals between weeks 6 and 12 significantly increased in the yoga exercise group. Progressive yoga exercises are effective program that reduce IRD among women in the early postpartum period through ultrasound evaluation. In conclusion, women should advocate combined yoga exercise in the early postpartum days following a supervised program."
