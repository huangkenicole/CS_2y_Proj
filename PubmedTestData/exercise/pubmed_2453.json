      "AbstractText": [
        "This study assessed the effectiveness of the Better Life After Cancer: Energy, Strength, and Support (BLESS) program, a 12-week social capital-based exercise adherence program for breast cancer survivors (BCS), regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), physical activity, and psychosocial characteristics.",
        "Forty-eight BCS with moderate or high (\u2265\u20094) CRF participated in this randomized control trial (intervention group n\u2009=\u200923, control group n\u2009=\u200925). The intervention group participated in small group sessions to activate social capital while targeting CRF in supervised physical exercises supplemented by home-based physical exercises. The control group was only given written information on exercise. A questionnaire was used to assess CRF, QOL, physical activity, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and social capital.",
        "The majority of participants had undergone surgery less than 2\u00a0years ago. After participating in BLESS, the CRF behavioral/severity domain significantly decreased (t\u2009=\u20092.642, p\u2009=\u20090.011) and physical activity significantly increased (t\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.049, p\u2009=\u20090.046) in the intervention group, in comparison with the control group; there were no significant post-intervention differences in the control group. Both groups showed improvements in sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and QOL.",
        "The BLESS program decreased behavioral/severity in the CRF and increased physical activity after 12\u00a0weeks among BCS. Future research needs to evaluate whether the promising results on physical activity and behavioral fatigue observed in the short term will persist over time. Also, longer-term effects should be examined."
