        "With healthcare costs on the rise, a global initiative was launched in 2007, called Exercise is Medicine, to prescribe and counsel patients on exercise to aid in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Since community pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare providers, this is an opportunity for pharmacists to also engage in this initiative. This study aimed to assess pharmacy student perceptions and knowledge on exercise to determine whether they are adequately prepared to counsel patients on exercise prescription. Third and fourth year pharmacy students were surveyed to test their basic knowledge of exercise prescription. Results show that 93.5% of students agreed or strongly agreed that it is important for pharmacists to counsel patients about exercise. The mean (SD) score for the 11 basic knowledge quiz questions on exercise prescription was 28.9% (SD 16.8), with no significant difference between third and fourth year pharmacy students. While students deemed exercise counseling as important, students proved deficient in exercise prescription knowledge. Schools of pharmacy may consider increasing curricular content to be congruent with this initiative."
