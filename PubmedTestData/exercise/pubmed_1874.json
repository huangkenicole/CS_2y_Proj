        "The abdominal muscles, upper extremities, and diaphragm work in synergy to maintain trunk stability during breathing.",
        "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a breathing technique combined with dynamic upper extremity exercise on the pulmonary function of healthy adults.",
        "Forty male participants in their 20s were recruited and randomly divided into two groups of 20 participants each: the experimental group performed a dynamic upper extremity exercise with breathing, and the control group only performed the breathing exercise. The experimental duration was 4 weeks, and both groups performed each training three times per a week. We performed pulmonary function test.",
        "Forced vital capacity increased significantly in both groups after the training period, but it was not significantly different between the two groups. Similarly, the forced expiratory volume at one second was not significantly different after training, but was significantly different between the two groups. In contrast, the peak expiratory flow did not show any significant within-group or between-group difference.",
        "Consequently, we came up with result that breathing exercise with dynamic upper extremity exercise improves pulmonary function. Our findings indicate that the breathing and dynamic upper extremity exercise described here should be considered in patients who require breathing therapy, since it seems to have beneficial effects on pulmonary function."
