        "We aimed to investigate the relationship between Borg scale and intensity of resistance training in patients who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Furthermore, the relationship between Borg scale, heart rate (HR), and intensity of exercise tolerance test was also studied.",
        "The study included 28 patients (19 men and 9 women) who had undergone allo-HSCT between June 2015 and February 2017. Their knee extension strengths and exercise tolerances were evaluated. Patients were asked to grade between 0 and 10 on Borg scale based on the level of difficulty experienced during exercising, after 10 repetitions in randomized 20, 40, and 60% resistance training for knee extension. Additionally, we evaluated Borg scale, HR, and load intensity during exercise tolerance test, every minute of the exercise for 2\u00a0weeks before and 3\u00a0weeks after HSCT.",
        "Knee extension strength and exercise tolerance were significantly decreased 3\u00a0weeks after HSCT from those before HSCT (p\u00a0<\u20090.01). Additionally, rise in Borg scale with increase in load intensity during knee extension resistance training, both before and after HSCT (p\u00a0<\u20090.01), was noted. Furthermore, Borg scale was found to be associated with HR and load intensity during exercise tolerance test in patients both before and after HSCT (p\u00a0<\u20090.01).",
        "A correlation was found between Borg scale with intensity of resistance training and exercise tolerance in patients who had undergone allo-HSCT. Therefore, Borg scale could be useful to determine the intensity of physical exercise in patients who have undergone allo-HSCT."
