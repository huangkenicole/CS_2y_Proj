      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>B</i><i>ackground and objectives:</i> Regular individualised physical exercise (PE) is a habit that not only has consequences for overall health (physical, emotional, social and mental) but can also have positive effects on organisations and institutions, as it helps workers to improve their personal balance and recover from the effort of their working day, showing higher levels of energy, commitment and productivity. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between the practice of PE and well-being in personal life and at work, as well as job satisfaction, overall health and the assessment of the personal training service provided by final-year students studying for a degree in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences. <i>Methods</i>: This study used a qualitative research methodology. There were 25 employees of the University of Almeria (UAL) (M = 52.16 \u00b1 9.55 years), divided into two focus groups and participating in the physical exercise program \"UAL Activa\". <i>Results</i>: The following three main themes, based on the results, emerged: (a) social well-being during PE practice, (b) assessment of the personal training service and (c) physical exercise as an emotional benefit at work. <i>Conclusion</i>. The workers' interventions have shown that participating in a personalised PE program led by a personal trainer can improve overall health and mood, with a very positive influence on the working environment."
