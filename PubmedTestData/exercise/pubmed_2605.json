        "Fourteen patients with stable coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.",
        "Patients followed 15 sessions of training (1 session per day, 3 days a week), either in the concentric group, following a standard programme, or in the eccentric group, performing eccentric resistance exercises using both lower limbs on a specifically designed ergometer.",
        "Symptom-limited Vo2, peak workload, isometric strength of leg extensor and ankle plantar flexors, distance covered during the 6-minute walk test and time to perform the 200-m fast walk test in both groups, before and after the training period.",
        "Patients did not report any adverse effects and were highly compliant. All measured parameters improved in eccentric and concentric group, except for 200-m fast walk test: symptom-limited Vo2 (+14.2% versus +4.6%), peak workload (+30.8% versus +19.3%), 6-minute walk test distance walked (+12.6% versus +10.1%) and leg extensor strength (+7% versus +13%) improved to a similar degree in both groups (P < 0.01); ankle plantar flexor strength improved in both groups with a significantly greater increase in the eccentric group (+17% versus +7%, P < 0.05).",
        "Patients with stable coronary artery disease can safely engage in eccentric endurance training, which appears to be as efficient as usual concentric training, with reduced oxygen consumption."
