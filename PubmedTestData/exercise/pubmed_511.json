        "Diabetes is a worldwide chronic disease. The incidence rate of this disease is high, and it is a common disease in clinics. At present, the incidence rate of diabetes patients is increasing year by year due to the increasing work pressure, the accelerated pace of life, the change of diet, the reduction of labor, and the acceleration of aging.",
        "The computer retrieves four databases to obtain random controlled trials on the influence of resistance exercise and aerobic exercise on type 2 diabetes. After a rigorous literature quality evaluation, data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.",
        "Ten studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. 10 studies reported the HbA<inf>1c</inf> of the test group and the control group, which was no significant statistical significance (SMD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.20,0.19; P=0.959) than the control group, HOMA-IR (SMD: 0.02; 95% CI: -0.65,0.69; P=0.954), SBP (SMD: 3.92; 95% CI: -0.92,8.75; P=0.112), DBP (SMD: 0.67; 95% CI: -3.66,5.01; P=0.761), HDL (SMD: -0.08; 95% CI: -2.79,2.64; P=0.955), TG (SMD: -7.51; 95% CI: -21.25,6.22; P=0.284) and TC (SMD: 9.10; 95% CI: -13.43,31.62; P=0.428).",
        "The results of this study suggest that both resistance exercise and aerobic exercise may be effective on patients with type 2 diabetes, as evidenced by HbA<inf>1c</inf>, HOMA-IR, SBP, DBP, HDL, TG and TC. There is no significant difference in their impact on type 2 diabetes patients, and the above conclusions need to be verified by more high-quality studies."
