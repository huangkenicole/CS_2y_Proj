        "<b>Background</b>: Culture and lifestyle could justify the variability in clinical patterns of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and was reported to affect exercise adherence.<b>Objective</b>: To explore perceptions and aspects influencing exercise adherence in people with knee OA in Jordan (a developing country) as they might be different from those reported in the developed world.<b>Methods</b>: Fourteen participants were included in the study (13 females, one male). One focus group and seven in depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The discussions were audio-taped and transcribed. Framework analysis was used and data were interpreted using the socio-ecological model.<b>Results</b>: At the individual level, knowledge of the role of exercise in knee OA and personal factors influenced exercise performance and adherence. At the sociocultural level, cultural attitudes and beliefs and social interaction affected exercises adherence. At the organizational/political level, suboptimal service delivery process, inappropriate delivery of home exercises, accessibility of services affected exercise adherence. Opportunities for improving service delivery were also reported. At the environmental level, geography and weather affected adherence.<b>Conclusions</b>: Understanding the interaction of health-related behavior with individual, social/cultural, organizational, and environmental aspects would improve exercise adherence and equip physiotherapists with knowledge and resources to facilitate the implementation of patient-centered services."
