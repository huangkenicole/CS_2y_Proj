      "AbstractText": [
        "Substantial evidence supports the benefits of supervised exercise training (ET) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, there are limitations such as transportation problems preventing physical activity for some people with MS. One opportunity for increasing physical activity participant in people with MS is home-based exercise training (HBET), yet we are unaware of a systematic review of HBET in people with MS. We undertook a systematic review for enhancing the knowledge about HBET in people with MS.",
        "To identify eligible studies, we included the medical subject headings (MeSH) keywords including 'multiple sclerosis' OR 'MS' OR 'degenerative nerve disease' AND 'home-based exercise' OR 'home-based training' OR 'home-based balance training' OR 'home-based rehabilitation' OR 'physical telerehabilitation' OR 'home-based walking' OR 'home-based step training.' Studies were included in this review that examined the effect of HBET in people with MS, were written in English, and available in full-text.",
        "According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 studies were judged eligible to be included in this systematic review. The results indicated that a total number of 10 studies had mainly implemented combined ET interventions. Balance and aerobic ET had been included in 5 studies. Three studies had further administered resistance ET interventions and one study had applied exergaming. Moreover, 13 studies had focused on the effects of ET on physical fitness, one article had reflected on the impact of ET on fatigue, and nine cases had included fatigue, quality of life, and fitness as outcome measures.",
        "Home-based ET, 2-7 times per week, is beneficial, feasible, and safe in people with MS. Nevertheless, there were notable limitations, including (a) adherence to interventions, which needs to be addressed in future studies, and (b) disability-related outcomes which should be considered in future HBET studies."
