        "Chronic Neck Pain is a major disease leading to disability in individuals around the world. Various rehabilitative approaches are being used worldwide to treat neck pain. This literature review highlights efficacy of those techniques used in correcting posture in chronic neck pain. In total 17 articles are included in this review (10 articles on exercises, Pilates 3, global postural re-education (GPR) 1, patient education 2, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation 1). The effects of the techniques were examined on individual outcomes (pain, disability), quality of life (QoL), and psychological aspects and the targeted aspects of physical function (muscle strength, mobility and endurance). Most of the techniques are effective compared to control group and few techniques in combination with other interventions like exercise and education had better improvements in outcomes, few techniques compared to one another found to be equally significant on reducing pain and disability. To date, it was challenging to affirm superiority of one technique over other. Further high quality research is needed to confirm the effect of these techniques with appropriate evaluation methods."
