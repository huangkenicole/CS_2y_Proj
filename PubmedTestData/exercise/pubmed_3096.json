        "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe progressive disease, associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor quality of life. Although scientific evidence supports the incorporation of specialized training in the treatment of PH, it is only available in a few countries.",
        "This article aims to share the experience of implementing a PH rehabilitation program, to summarize the barriers and prerequisites for launching this service, and to assess its early effect. We retrospectively analyzed our pathway in organizing this program, by singling out essential steps.",
        "The preparation phase took about 14 months. Establishing and running of a PH rehabilitation program required dedicated rehabilitation specialists to join the multidisciplinary PH expert team. Team members needed to gain special knowledge on exercise training in severely compromised patients; thus, supervision and education by experienced consultants was crucial. The main eligibility criteria for patients were stable status, optimal medical treatment, and motivation to undergo the training. The first results evaluating the effect of a specialized PH training program in 9 patients are promising. Seven of them improved their functional capacity over the period of 15 weeks.",
        "Despite a number of challenges and barriers, the implementation of a specialized rehabilitation program should be encouraged in a few dedicated PH expert centers per country, who are capable to fulfill all prerequisites and organizational aspects. Local PH experts, supervision by an experienced center, in-patient rehabilitation facilities, dedicated personnel, equipment, and patient motivation are essential."
