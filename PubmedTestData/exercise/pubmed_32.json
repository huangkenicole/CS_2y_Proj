        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been recognized as the number one killer for decades. The most well-known risk factor is atherosclerosis. Unlike the acuity of CVD, atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive pathological change. This process involves inflammatory response, oxidative reaction, macrophage activity, and different interaction of inflammatory factors. Physical exercise has long been known as good for health in general. In recent studies, physical exercise has been demonstrated to be a therapeutic tool for atherosclerosis. However, its therapeutic effect has dosage-dependent effect. Un-proper over exercise might also cause damage to the heart. Here we summarize the mechanism of Physical exercise's beneficial effects and its potential clinical use."
