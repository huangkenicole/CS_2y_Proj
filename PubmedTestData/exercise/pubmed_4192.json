        "To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of balneotherapy and/or aquatic exercise on bone metabolism.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to January 4, 2021. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effect model according to study heterogeneity.",
        "Seven articles involving 467 participants were selected. Three balneotherapy studies were qualitatively integrated. The results showed that bone resorption slowed down with or without stimulation of bone formation. A pooled meta-analysis of four studies on aquatic exercise showed significant evidence for a reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH; SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.71; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.38; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a significant increase in osteocalcin (OC; SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.60; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.03; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) after aquatic exercise.",
        "Balneotherapy and aquatic exercise had significant effects on bone metabolism, reducing bone resorption and/or increasing bone formation. This study highlights the importance of balneotherapy and aquatic exercise for bone health."
