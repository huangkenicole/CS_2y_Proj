        "Physiotherapy plays an important role in fall prevention, and is a science- and evidence-based profession that is constantly undergoing development. Currently, the possibility of digital fall prevention is being explored; however, the perception of physiotherapists (PTs) toward a digital approach is still a sparsely investigated topic.",
        "This study aimed to explore the PT's experiences with a fall prevention exercise program used in their daily work and their thoughts regarding the use of digital support in this context.",
        "Discussions were held in two focus groups with seven PTs (age: 26-48\u00a0years). A qualitative content analysis was performed.",
        "We identified two main categories: 1) The importance of evidence-based fall prevention exercise; and 2) Transition toward a digital fall prevention exercise approach. The participants expressed that they had time- and resource-related limitations affecting evidence-based work and adherence to fall prevention exercise programs. They stated that education and management support were required.",
        "There is a need for fall prevention exercise to be evidence-based and prioritized in physiotherapy. The study results provide insights into the lack of adherence to fall prevention exercise programs and highlighted the need for a transition toward working digitally in the future."
