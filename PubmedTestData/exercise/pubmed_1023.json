        "Although supervised aerobic and resistance training in a hospital setting was proven safe and beneficial for well-controlled myasthenia gravis (MG) patients, implementation of similar programs in the community has not been studied. We conducted a pragmatic open-label study at a large gym in Uppsala, Sweden. Seven patients with generalized MG were recruited to participate in an individualized, tailored exercise program, based on individual baseline status and personal goals, with a personal trainer. All patients completed the entire training period. The individually tailored exercise program was implemented safely and effectively, with all patients improving in aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and balance. Our pragmatic open-label case study suggests that well-controlled patients with generalized MG can extend their physical exercise to personal training in the gym. This is an essential step towards reducing the barriers to implementing exercise procols and increasing the availability of these interventions to MG patients."
