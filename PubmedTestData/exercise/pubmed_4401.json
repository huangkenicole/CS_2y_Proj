        "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of listening to pre-exercise music on bench press performance. We recruited 10 resistance trained males (M age= 22.8, SD\u2009=\u20095.8\u2009years; M height= 173.7, SD\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009cm; M body mass\u2009=\u200981.0, SD\u2009=\u200918.2\u2009kg) for this crossover counterbalanced research design. Participants completed two bench press exercise trials of (a) No music (NM), and (b) Pre-exercise music (PreExM) separated by at least 48\u2009hours. For each trial, following a warm-up, participants listened to music or no music for three minutes. After this 3-minute period, they completed one set of bench press repetitions with maximum explosive intent at 75% one repetition maximum (1 RPM). We used a rotary encoder to measure power and velocity of barbell movement. After a 3-minute rest during which they again listened to music or no music, participants completed another set of repetitions to failure (RTF) at 75% of 1RM. Immediately following this second set of repetitions, we measured exercise motivation with a visual analog scale (VAS). We found that the PreExM condition increased mean power output (p\u2009=\u20090.005; d\u2009=\u20090.792) and barbell velocity (p\u2009=\u20090.015; d\u2009=\u20090.722). RTF were significantly higher during the PreExM versus NM trial (p\u2009=\u20090.002; d\u2009=\u20090.985), and motivation was significantly higher in the PreExM trial versus NM (p\u2009=\u20090.001; d\u2009=\u20090.932). These findings suggest improved muscle power explosiveness and strength-endurance when listening to music before a bench press exercise. From a practical standpoint, athletes who have the option of listening to music immediately prior to resistance exercise may benefit from its use."
