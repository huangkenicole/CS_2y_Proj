        "In this paper, we present a method for the creation of a library of inertial signals based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for step characterization, with preliminary results in control subjects and patients with neurological diseases. Subjects performed a protocol including a 10 m straight walking, then turn back and walking for additional 10 m. The library is constructed with inertial signals (acceleration and angular velocities recorded in three directions) aligned with the DTW. Templates in the library are obtained for a specific cohort and for the different walking phases of the protocol. They are compared to the signal of a single subject by calculating a Pearson correlation coefficient. The method has been tested on a database of 864 exercises, obtained from 71 healthy controls, 24 patients with Parkinson disease and 48 patients with Radiation Induced Leukoencephalopathy (RIL). Pearson correlation classification reports a precision of about 85% for step detection. For exercise characterization the sensitivity is about 57%, 56% and 82% for Parkinson, RIL and control subjects respectively."
