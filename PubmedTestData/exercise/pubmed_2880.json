        "People with heart failure experience marked reduction in their exercise capacity which has detrimental effects on their activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, and ultimately their hospital ad-mission rate and mortality. Numerous cardiac rehabilitation studies have demonstrated functional benefits, improvement in quality of life and clinical outcomes from exercise training in patients with HFrEF. Based on evidences, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) consistently recommend exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation(CR) as an effective and safe adjunct for patients with stable class II to III heart failure (HF) who do not have advanced arrhythmias and who do not have other limitations to exercise. This recommendation applies to patients with HFrEF as well as to patients with HFpEF besides patients with class IV HF, although the data are not as robust for patients with HFpEF. In this article, the clinical evidence on effects of exercise for HFrEF and HFpEF as well as end-stage heart failure were separately reviewed."
