        "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic vascular disease resulting in pervasive morbidity and mortality, particularly among older adults. One first-line therapy to improve symptoms, function, and clinical outcomes in PAD is supervised exercise therapy (SET), which is based primarily on a structured, start-and-stop walking protocol and is often implemented in cardiac rehabilitation programs. SET is supported by a Class IA guideline for patients with symptomatic PAD; however, despite the effectiveness of SET and the 2017 CMS decision to cover SET for PAD, challenges of awareness, access, and implementation of SET persist. Recent efforts to address these challenges include digital health and hybrid approaches to SET that may minimize barriers to care by delivering SET in more innovative, flexible formats. Further study is needed to understand barriers, improve awareness, and implement SET in more equitable and accessible ways."
