        "Hyperreflexia develops after spinal cord injury (SCI) in the human and in the spinal cord transected animal, and can be measured by the loss of low frequency-dependent depression of the H-reflex. Previous studies demonstrated normalization of low frequency-dependent depression of the H-reflex using passive exercise when initiated prior to the development of hyperreflexia. We examined the effects of passive exercise prior to compared to after the development of hyperreflexia in the transected rat. Adult female rats underwent complete transection (Tx) at T10. Frequency-dependence of the H-reflex was tested following passive exercise for 30 days, initiated prior to hyperreflexia in one group compared to initiation after hyperreflexia became established, and compared to intact and untreated Tx groups. An additional Tx group completed 60 days of exercise initiated after hyperreflexia was established. Lumbar enlargement tissue was harvested for western blot to compare Connexin-36 protein levels in control vs Tx animals vs Tx animals that were passively exercised. No differences in whole tissue were evident, although regional differences may still be present in Connexin-36 levels. Statistically significant decreases in low frequency-dependent depression of the H-reflex were observed following 30 days of exercise initiated prior to the onset of hyperreflexia, and also after 60 days of exercise when initiated after hyperreflexia had been established, compared with Tx only animals. We concluded that modulation of spinal circuitry by passive exercise took place when initiated before and after the onset of hyperreflexia, but different durations of exercise were required."
