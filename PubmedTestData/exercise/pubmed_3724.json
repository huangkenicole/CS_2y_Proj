        "This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the feasibility and acceptability of exercise and controlled trial methods in adults awaiting or having undergone bariatric surgery (BS). Search methods used to identify relevant articles were inclusion of articles identified in a systematic review, new database search of articles published 2019-2021, and hand searching reference lists. Titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened by two reviewers independently against inclusion criteria: adults awaiting or having undergone BS, controlled trial, exercise group compared with a comparison group without exercise. Twenty-eight articles were reviewed; most interventions were supervised, performed after BS, and lasted \u226413\u2009weeks. Pooled data for exercise intervention attendance and dropout rates were 84% (k\u2009=\u200910) and 5% (k\u2009=\u200919), respectively, though possibly misestimated due to poor/selective reporting. Median study and recruitment duration were 18\u2009weeks and 24\u2009months, respectively, with a pooled enrollment rate of 2.5 participants/month. Pooled data for refusal to participate, enrollment, and retention rates were 23% (k\u2009=\u200916), 43% (k\u2009=\u200918), and 87% (k\u2009=\u200926), respectively. Despite the lack of data available in studies included, exercise and controlled trial methods seem feasible and acceptable for adults awaiting or having undergone BS. To better identify methodological or practical challenges, and assess bias, better reporting of feasibility and acceptability indicators is needed in future studies."
