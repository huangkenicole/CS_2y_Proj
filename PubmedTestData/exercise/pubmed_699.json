        "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of high intensity (HI) vs low-to-moderate intensity (LMI) exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) up to 18\u00a0months after commencement of oncological treatment in patients with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. In addition, we conducted a comparison with usual care (UC).",
        "Patients scheduled for (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment (n\u2009=\u2009577) were randomly assigned to 6\u00a0months of combined resistance and endurance training of HI or LMI. A longitudinal descriptive study (UC) included participants (n\u2009=\u200989) immediately before the RCT started. HRQoL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline, 3, 6 and 18\u00a0months (1\u00a0year after completed exercise intervention) follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to study the groups over time.",
        "Directly after the intervention, HI scored significant (P\u2009=\u20090.02), but not clinically relevant, higher pain compared with LMI. No other significant difference in HRQoL was found between the exercise intensities over time. Clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL over time were detected within both exercise intensities. We found favourable significant differences in HRQoL in both exercise intensities compared with UC over time.",
        "This study adds to the strong evidence of positive effect of exercise and shows that exercise, regardless of intensity, can have beneficial effects on HRQoL during oncological treatment and also for a substantial time after completion of an exercise intervention. In this study, for one year after.",
        "Patients can be advised to exercise at either intensity level according to their personal preferences, and still benefit from both short-term and long-term improvements in HRQoL."
