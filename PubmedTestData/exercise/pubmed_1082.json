        "The modalities at present in use for the treatment of soft-tissue injuries responsible for the low back strain syndrome are predominantly passive, yet similar soft-tissue injuries elsewhere in the body receive and respond to an early program of active movement. To assess the feasibility of such an approach to the low back strain syndrome, a program of therapeutic exercises with and without the addition of heat and massage was employed for the treatment of this condition. Exercises alone were found to be as effective as a program of \"heat, massage and exercises\" in resolving the presenting complaints. At the same time this dynamic approach served to reduce the undesirable effects, both local and general, of the enforced inactivity of the patient."
