      "AbstractText": [
        "In this systematic review, we aim to synthesize published evidence on the effects of exercise in improving postural stability among older adults with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A systematic electronic literature search was undertaken in Pedro, Cochrane, MEDLINE, ProQuest, Science direct and Clinical trial databases involving human participants published from year 2000-2022. This search was updated in June 2022. The studies chosen were based on predetermined criteria. Data relating to the contents and parameters of exercise in persons with AD were gathered and analyzed. A total of 8 experimental studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the selected studies were of a medium quality. In these studies, information and physical exercises were used to improve postural stability in older adults with AD. The findings of the review suggest that performing combined strength, balance and executive function training can improve postural stability. However, we are unable to conclude the specific dose for specific type of exercise. More high-quality studies are required pertaining to exercise prescription for older adults with AD. Mostly, information and physical exercise were delivered via face-to-face sessions conducted by health professionals. The structure of exercises summarized in this review may be beneficial for older adults with AD to improve postural stability and as a result reduce falls."
