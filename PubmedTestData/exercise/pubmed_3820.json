        "This study aimed to determine the effects of an aquatic training program on functional capacity, perceptual aspects, and quality of life (QoL) performed by older adults with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and moderate/high risk of falls.",
        "This randomized controlled trial included 120 older adults assigned to aquatic exercises (AG; n\u00a0=\u00a060; 70.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.04\u00a0years) and a control group (CG; n\u00a0=\u00a060; 71.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.95\u00a0years). The risk of falls, perceptual aspects (fall risk awareness and pain), functional capacity (lower and upper body strength, lower and upper body flexibility, functional mobility, and balance) and QoL were assessed at baseline and after the experimental protocol. The AG performed 16\u00a0weeks of aquatic exercises (twice per week, 45\u00a0min.session<sup>-1</sup>) with lower and upper body strength, stretching, and balance exercises. Exercise intensity was controlled using the rate of perceived exertion (12-16 on the Borg scale [6-20 points]) and heart rate (progressing from 40% to 60% of the heart-rate reserve).",
        "The training program improved the lower (mean difference [95% CI]: 2.7 [2.0 to 3.3]) and upper body strength (3.5 [2.6 to 4.5]), lower (4.6 [3.4 to 5.8]) and upper body flexibility (6.5 [4.3 to 8.6]), functional mobility (-2.5 [-2.9 to -1.9]), and balance (11.2 [10.6 to 11.9]); reduced pain perception (-3.2 [-3.7 to -2.8]); increased the fall risk awareness (9.5 [8.8 to 10.1]) and QoL perception (5.6 to 22.6 [4.6 to 25.1]).",
        "The water-based program may be used as a preventive approach for the older adults with MSDs and at risk of falling to improve physical and usual perceptual aspects (QoL and pain) and fall risk awareness."
