        "No study has performed an exercise intervention that included high-intensity, free-weight, functional resistance training, and assessed frailty status as an inclusion criteria and outcome measure via original, standardized tools, in pre-frail females.",
        "Determine if the intervention strategy is not only feasible and safe, but can also improve frailty status, functional task performance, and muscle strength.",

        "Community.",
        "20 older-adults with pre-frailty characteristics.",
        "12-weeks (3 days/week, 45-60 minutes/session) of multi-component exercise, inclusive of aerobic, resistance, balance and flexibility exercises. The crux of the program was balance and resistance exercises, the latter utilized high-intensity, free-weight, functional resistance training. The control group maintained their usual care.",
        "1) Feasibility and safety (dropout, adherence, and adverse event); 2) Frailty (Frailty Phenotype, Clinical Frailty Scale, and gait speed); 3) Functional task performance (grip strength and sit-to-stand time); and 4) Isometric and isotonic strength of the knee extensors and elbow flexors.",
        "No participants dropped out of the intervention or experienced an adverse event, and adherence averaged 88.3%. The exercise group became less frail, whereas the control group became more frail. There was a significant within-group improvement in exercise participants gait speed (p \u2264 0.01, +0.24 m/sec), grip strength (p \u2264 0.01, +3.9 kg), and sit-to-stand time (p \u2264 0.01, -5.0 sec). There was a significant within-group improvement in exercise participants knee extension isometric torque (p \u2264 0.05, +7.4 Nm) and isotonic velocity (p = \u2264 0.01, +37.5 \u02da/sec). Elbow flexion isotonic velocity significantly declined within the control group (p \u2264 0.01, -20.2 \u02da/sec) and demonstrated a significant between-group difference (p \u2264 0.05, 40.73 \u02da/sec) post-intervention.",
        "The intervention strategy appears to be feasible and safe, and may also improve frailty status, functional task performance, and muscle strength. These results help calculate effect size for a future randomized controlled trial."
