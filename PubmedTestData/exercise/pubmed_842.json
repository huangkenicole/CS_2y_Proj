        "Prospective Case Series.",
        "Variety of studies inquired the effectiveness of exercise treatment in LET (Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy). The research on the effectiveness of these approaches are still ongoing and very much needed due to the uncertainty of the subject.",
        "We aimed to understand how the application of exercises in a graded manner affect the treatment outcomes in terms of pain and function.",
        "This study is completed by 28 patients with LET and it was planned as a prospective case series. Thirty participants were included to participate in the exercise group. Basic Exercises (Grade 1) were performed for four weeks. Advanced Exercises (Grade 2) were performed for another four weeks. The VAS (Visual Analog Scale), pressure algometer, the PRTEE (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation) and a grip strength dynamometer were used to measure outcomes. The measurements were performed at baseline, at the end of four weeks and at the end of eight weeks.",
        "Investigation of the pain scores revealed that all VAS scores (p < 0.05, ES\u00a0=\u00a01.35; 0.72; 0,73 activity, rest, and night respectively) and pressure algometer results were improved both during basic (p < 0.05, ES\u00a0=\u00a00.91) and advanced exercises (p < 0.05, ES\u00a0=\u00a00,41). PRTEE scores were found to be improved in patients with LET after basic and advanced exercises (p > 0.001, ES\u00a0=\u00a01.15; p > 0.001, ES\u00a0=\u00a01.56 respectively). The grip strength only changed after basic exercises (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, ES\u00a0=\u00a00.56).",
        "The basic exercises were beneficial for both pain and function. However, advanced exercises are required for obtaining further improvements in terms of pain, function, and grip strength."
