        "Maintaining cognitive and physical function is essential to healthy aging.",
        "This study aims to investigate the effect of an exercise-cognitive dual-task program in Chinese language on cognitive function and functional fitness in older adults.",
        "Seventy adults aged 60-84\u00a0years were conveniently assigned to one of the three groups: exercise-cognitive dual-task (EC) group (n\u2009=\u200928), exercise group (n\u2009=\u200922), and control group (n\u2009=\u200920). The EC group received a 90-min class including multicomponent exercise-cognitive dual-task twice a week. The exercise group received a 90-min class including multicomponent exercise twice a week. The control group maintained their regular level of physical activity and general lifestyle. Cognitive functions and functional fitness were measured before and after the 12-week intervention.",
        "The participants in the EC and exercise group significantly improved scores in Taiwanese Frontal Assessment Battery, the Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test, and the Mini-Mental State Examination; however, those in the control group did not. The participants in the EC and exercise group showed significant increases in almost all functional fitness tests. The participants in the EC group showed significantly higher improvements in Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test score and aerobic endurance than the exercise group and in Chang Gung University Orthographical Fluency Test score and lower body strength than the control group. In addition, the changes in Taiwanese Frontal Assessment Battery and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly correlated with the changes in functional fitness.",
        "The dual-task intervention resulted in greater improvements in verbal fluency, endurance, and muscular strength than exercise alone and control."
