        "Arm crank ergometry (ACE), functional electrical stimulation leg cycling exercise (FES-LCE), and the combination of the two (FES hybrid exercise) have all been used as activities to help improve the fitness-related health of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). More recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become popular in the non-disabled community due to its ability to produce greater aerobic fitness benefits or equivalent benefits with reduced time commitment.",
        "This thematic review of the literature sought to determine the potential benefits and practicality of using ACE, FES-LCE, and FES hybrid exercise in an interval training format for individuals with SCI.",
        "Systematic literature searches were conducted in May 2020 and March 2021 focusing on interval training in individuals with SCI. Pre-defined nested search terms were used to narrow the available literature from 4273 citations to 1362 articles. The titles and abstracts were then reviewed to determine the appropriateness of the articles ending with fifteen articles.",
        "The literature was limited to fifteen articles with low participant numbers (n\u2009=\u20091-20). However, in each article, HIIT protocols either demonstrated a greater improvement in cardiovascular, metabolic, or practicality scores compared to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) protocols, or improvement during relatively brief time commitments.",
        "The available literature lacked sufficient numbers of randomized control trials. However, the available evidence is encouraging concerning the potential benefits and practicality of using HIIT (ACE, FES-LCE, or FES hybrid exercise) to improve aerobic and anaerobic capacity and decrease cardiometabolic risk after SCI."
