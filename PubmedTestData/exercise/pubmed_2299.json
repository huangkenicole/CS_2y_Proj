        "The mainstay in the treatment of Osgood-Schlatter Disease (OSD) is guidance on activity modification alongside exercises. The purpose of this study was to create an informative leaflet for patients with OSD, based on evidence and stakeholders perspectives. A synthesis of the literature, including national reference work, clinical research, and systematic reviews informed the initial leaflet. Twelve children with OSD and four clinical experts provided feedback through semi-structured interviews. After incorporating stakeholder input, the leaflet 'Osgood-Schlatter-Information and guidance' was developed. This provides a resource to assist the provision of information and translation of the current evidence."
