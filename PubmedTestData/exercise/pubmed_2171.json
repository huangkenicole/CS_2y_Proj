        "There is strong evidence from meta-analyses that exercise as a single intervention can reduce the number and risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults, yet not all types of exercise are equal.",
        "Programs that include 3\u00a0h a week of exercise and provide a high challenge to balance can reduce falls by almost 40%. Reactive and volitional stepping interventions have also been shown to reduce falls by about 50%. Evidence is less clear regarding the efficacy of exercise in individuals who have experienced a stroke, who live in long-term care, who have been recently discharged from the hospital, or who have visual impairments, but there is some evidence that multifactorial programs may be useful.",
        "Depending on the population, exercise as a single or as part of a multifactorial intervention may be beneficial in reducing falls."
