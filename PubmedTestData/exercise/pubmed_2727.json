        "Therapeutic exercise may benefit patients with incurable cancer, but there is little data on its practicality. We have explored the acceptability of six exercise programmes based on different types of exercise, the preferred delivery method, location and time relative to anticancer treatments and whether various patient characteristics influence choice of exercise.",
        "A questionnaire determined patients' perceived capability and preparedness to undertake six exercise programmes, each illustrated by looping video clips and accompanying text, most preferred programme and preferences for its delivery. Frequency counts and percentages were calculated and multiple logistic regression used to examine associations between patient characteristics and preparedness to undertake each of the programmes.",
        "Two hundred patients (103 female; mean (SD) age 64 (9); ECOG 02) with common incurable cancers mostly receiving palliative chemotherapy took part. All considered themselves physically capable of undertaking one or more of the exercise programmes and two-thirds were prepared to undertake a programme at that moment in time. The three most preferred exercise programmes were those based on neuromuscular electrical stimulation, walking and resistance training. The majority of patients preferred to undertake exercise at home, alone and unsupervised. One-third were not prepared to undertake any exercise, with a tendency for the least prepared to be older males and those with a lower performance status.",
        "Our findings suggest that it is realistic to develop exercise as a supportive therapy for patients with incurable cancer, including those receiving chemotherapy, and can be used to inform further research in this area."
