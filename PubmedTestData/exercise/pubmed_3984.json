        "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a multicomponent rehabilitation protocol on functional outcomes in a post-acute care facility.",
        "Eleven older, medically complex patients (80.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3\u00a0yrs) completed a multicomponent rehabilitation protocol during a stay at a post-acute care facility. Gait speed, Berg Balance scores, and sit-to-stand velocity were examined upon admission and discharge. Bayesian paired sample t-tests were used to determine changes from PRE to POST and linear regression analyses were used to determine the influence of length of stay.",
        "Gait speed increased by 0.26\u00a0m/s (49% increase) from PRE (0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0m/s) to POST (0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0m/s) exercise intervention (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). Berg Balance Scores significantly increased by 26% from PRE (38.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.33) to POST (45.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.32) exercise intervention (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). A 45% increase in STS velocity from PRE (0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0m/s) to POST (0.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0m/s; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) was observed following the multicomponent rehabilitation protocol. Length of stay did not influence improvements in gait speed, Berg Balance Scores, nor Sit-to-stand velocity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.176-0.811).",
        "The multicomponent rehabilitation protocol with movement velocity biofeedback is feasible in a post-acute care facility in medically complex older patients and demonstrates improvements in clinical mobility and balance outcomes."
