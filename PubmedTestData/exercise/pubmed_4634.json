        "The purpose of this study was to examine whether joint angle specificity occurs in open and closed kinetic chain resistance training of the knee extensors after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Isokinetic knee extensor strength was measured at 60 and 210 degrees.s(-1) in 32 patients, 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. Between test sessions, patients participated in a 4-week program of injured leg resistance training of the knee extensors in either open kinetic chain (OKC) knee extension or leg press exercises. Isokinetic testing knee range of motion (ROM) was divided into 5 equal portions from flexion to extension, and the mean torque was calculated over those divisions: 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, and 80-100% ROM. Analysis of variance indicated that there were no significant differences between patients in the knee extension or leg press exercise groups."
