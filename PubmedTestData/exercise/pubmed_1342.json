        "The benefit of supervised physiotherapy after rotator cuff surgery is unclear. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of supervised physiotherapy after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction.",
        "Eighty patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears were randomly assigned to either supervised physiotherapy or home exercises only. The primary outcome measure was the Constant score at 12 months after surgery.",
        "A total of 70 patients were available for analyses at 1-year follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome between the treatment groups.",
        "Supervised physiotherapy after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction does not provide additional benefit compared with home exercises alone at 1-year follow-up."
