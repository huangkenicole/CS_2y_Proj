        "The main aim of this umbrella review was to assess the impact of exercise-based interventions (EBIs) on sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). We searched systematically in PubMed, PEDro, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Google Scholar. Methodological quality was analyzed using AMSTAR and ROBIS scale, and the strength of evidence was established according to GRADE. Nine systematic reviews were included. Meta-analysis (MA) of primary studies (n\u00a0=\u00a042) were performed with a random-effects model. The MA revealed a moderate statistically significant effect of EBIs (SMD=-0.46 [-0.69 to -0.23]). Subgroup analyses by type of exercise showed significant effect of body-mind exercises (SMD=-0.55 [-0.86 to -0.23]) and combined exercises (SMD=-1.11 [-2.12 to -0.11]) but not for aerobic (SMD=-0.04 [-0.15 to 0.07]) or strength (SMD=-0.52 [-1.14 to 0.1]) exercises in isolation. The results obtained showed that EBIs were effective in improving sleep quality compared to minimal intervention, no intervention or usual care, with a low certainty of evidence. Subgroup analyses showed that mind-body and combined exercises elicited the strongest effect, while aerobic and strength exercise in isolation did not show significant effects."
