      "AbstractText": [
        "Several recent studies show a growing popularity of therapeutic climbing (TC) for patients with various conditions. This could be an attempt to fill the gap left by traditional exercises that do not always address physical, mental, and social well-being. This review provides an overview of the physical, mental, and social effects and safety aspects of climbing for different indications.",
        "A literature search was conducted on July 8, 2020 (update search August 26, 2021). We searched MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, and PubMed and bibliographies of included studies, and we conducted a manual search.",
        "Two independent reviewers evaluated the quality of the studies using appropriate Risk of Bias (RoB) tools, and the level of evidence for each domain was graded. Study characteristics and effectiveness data for TC were extracted and synthesized. Meta-analyses were conducted for the three dimensions (physical/mental/social health), using a random-effects model.",
        "A total of 112 publications were reviewed, and 22 full-text articles were assessed regarding the eligibility criteria, of which 18 trials involving 568 patients were included. TC is safe and positively affects physical (e.g., fitness, motor control, movement velocity, dexterity, strength), mental (e.g., depressiveness, somatisation, psychoticism, emotion regulation, body perception, self-esteem, fatigue), and social (e.g., social functioning, trust, communication, sense of responsibility) health for individuals with neurological, orthopedic, psychiatric, and pediatric ailments. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in the physical dimension favoring the climbing group. Improvements that were not statistically significant were found for the mental/social dimensions in the climbing group. The heterogeneity of data was moderate/high (social/mental dimension), and for the physical dimension, data were homogenous.",
        "The studies investigating TC outline its positive effects in various patient groups. TC is a safe and effective treatment for improving physical/mental/social well-being. This review is based on the best available evidence; however, significant gaps remain in providing sufficiently strong evidence."
