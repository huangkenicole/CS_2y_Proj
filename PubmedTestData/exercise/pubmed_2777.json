      "AbstractText": [
        "Motor impairment due to spasticity, weakness, and insufficient selective motor control is a key feature of cerebral palsy (CP). For standing and walking, the gluteal muscles play an important role. Physical therapy represents an evidence-based treatment to promote strength and endurance but may be limited to address selective motor control. Treatment incorporating neurostimulating techniques may increase the therapeutic benefits in these situations.",
        "The aim of this case report was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and clinical effects of a customized protocol of functional repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (frNMS).",
        "This case report describes a frNMS protocol applied to the gluteal muscles in an 8-year old boy with bilateral spastic CP. The protocol combines 12 sessions of customized physiotherapeutic exercises with simultaneous electromagnetic stimulation.",
        "frNMS protocol was adhered to as planned, no relevant adverse events were observed. At day fourafter the intervention the patient reported clinical benefits and improvements of standing and walking assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure dimensions D (+5.1%) and E (+4.2%) were documented. Body sway as measured by center of pressure displacement during posturography decreased.",
        "Clinical studies are warranted to assess effects of frNMS and its mechanisms of action in a controlled setting."
