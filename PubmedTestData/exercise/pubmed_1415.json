        "Lack of exercise is a primary cause for today's level of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. Thus, exercise as a therapeutic modality has an important role. Beneficial effects of exercise have been extensively documented, specifically in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, disorders of fat metabolism, heart insufficiency, cancer, etc. A regular (at least 3 x per week) endurance training program of 30-40 min duration at an intensity of 65-70% of VO(2)max involving large muscle groups is recommended. The specific exercise activity can also positively affect individuals with orthopedic disease patterns, i.e., osteoporosis, back pain, postoperative rehabilitation, etc. Endurance strength training in the form of sequential training involving approx. 8-10 different exercises for the most important muscle groups 2 x per week is a suitable exercise therapy. One to three sets with 8-12 repetitions per exercise should be performed until volitional exhaustion of the trained muscle groups among healthy adults and 15-20 repetitions among older and cardiac patients. Apart from a positive effect on the locomotor system, this type of strength training has positive effects on CHD, diabetes mellitus, and cancer."
