        "We considered spinal segmental movement exercise that voluntarily control local muscles as a convenient treatment to correct the trunk muscle recruitment pattern in individuals with global muscle overactivity. The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of segmental flexion and extension movements of the spine and overall flexion and extension movements of the spinal column on the flexibility of the spinal column among healthy university students who had completed a day of lectures and had a certain load on their lower back as a preliminary step to applying the exercise to low back pain patients with a broken trunk muscle recruitment pattern.",
        "The subjects performed trunk flexion/extension exercises that required segmental control of the spine (segmental movement) and trunk flexion/extension exercises that do not require segmental control of the spine (total movement) in the chair position. As an evaluation task, finger floor distance (FFD) and muscle tension of the hamstrings were evaluated before and after exercise intervention.",
        "There was no significant difference in the FFD value and the passive pressure before the intervention between the two exercises. FFD decreased significantly after the intervention compared to that before, and passive pressure did not change in both motor tasks. The FFD change amount of segmental movement was significantly larger than that of total movement. (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).",
        "It has been suggested that segmental spinal movements improve spinal mobility and may reduce global muscle tension."
