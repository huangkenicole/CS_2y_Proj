        "This study investigated the impact of McKenzie exercises against deep neck flexor (DNF) combined with scapulothoracic exercises on improving pain severity, cervical mobility, and functional disability.",
        "Fifty-five subjects suffering from chronic neck pain participated in this randomized controlled study. They were randomly assigned to three groups; the DNF group, which was treated by traditional physical therapy (i.e., physical therapy agents, stretching, and isometric exercises), combined with DNF, and scapulothoracic exercises; the McKenzie group, treated by traditional physical therapy, combined with McKenzie exercises; and finally, a control group, treated by traditional physical therapy. Before and after 6 weeks of treatment, they were assessed for neck pain severity, cervical range of motion (ROM), and functional disability using a visual analog scale (VAS), a gravity-reference goniometer, and the Copenhagen neck functional disability scale (CNFDS), respectively.",
        "Compared to baseline, all groups showed a significant decrease in neck pain severity and disability (p <0.05), and there was a significant increase in neck flexion/extension, lateral right flexion/left flexion, and right/left rotation ROMs (p<0.05). The improvement of the McKenzie group was significantly higher than the DNF group, and control group. Moreover, the improvement of the DNF group was significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05).",
        "The McKenzie exercises were better than DNF combined with scapulothoracic exercises to treat neck pain, functional disability, and mobility."
