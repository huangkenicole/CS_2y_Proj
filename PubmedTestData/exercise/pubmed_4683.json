        "Low physical activity has long been identified as a risk factor for coronary heart disease.",
        "The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence changes in the physical activity of patients following an acute coronary syndrome event.",
        "The prospective, inferential cohort design recruited patients admitted to hospital following an acute coronary syndrome event across five research sites. Physical activity was assessed using the short form international physical activity questionnaire.",
        "Data were collected at baseline and 3 months on 380 patients. The sample profile was: 21% women; body mass index 28 \u00b1 4.6; unstable angina 36%; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 25%; non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 39% and a mean age of 63 \u00b1 11.8. There was a significant improvement in physical activity at 3 months ( n=380, t=-3.704, P\u22640.001). All regression models, baseline, 3 months and change in physical activity were significant ( p\u22640.001). Low physical activity was associated with: at baseline not having health insurance, older age and depression; at 3 months not having health insurance, not in employment and low baseline physical activity; and improvement in physical activity was associated with low physical activity at baseline and not being in employment.",
        "While physical activity improved significantly, 45% did not reach guideline recommendation levels at 3 months post-event. Physical activity change was little influenced by sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and behavioural factors, suggesting the need to look elsewhere such as behavioural change and improved processes across the care divide to improve physical activity in this at-risk population."
