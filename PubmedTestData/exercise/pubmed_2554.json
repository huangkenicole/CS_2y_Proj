      "AbstractText": [
        "Progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) reduces cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in the general population. It is unknown if PRET also reduces these risk factors in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). The aim is to present the protocol of an intervention study that investigates the effect of PRET on CVRF in adults with ID. We will use a repeated time series design with one study group. Adults with mild-to-moderate ID and at least two CVRF are eligible (Netherlands Trial Register, NL8382). During a 12-week baseline period, measurements take place at a 6-week interval. After this, the PRET programme starts for 24 weeks, after which all measurements will be repeated. We will use hierarchical regression models, adjusted for sport activity and medication use, to estimate the effect of PRET. After the intervention, the participants will be followed-up for 12 weeks. We will evaluate factors for successful implementation of exercise in daily life. Primary outcomes are: hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome. Secondary outcomes are: physical fitness, sarcopenia, physical activity, activities of daily living, falls, challenging behaviour. If our results show that the PRET programme is effective, it may be a promising non-pharmacological intervention to reduce CVRF in adults with ID."
