        "This study aimed to understand the key factors experienced accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs) and medical professionals consider when prescribing/recommending aerobic exercise to patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.",
        "Modified Delphi Survey.",
        "A four-round, two-phase survey was conducted. Following a Delphi approach, four cancer-specific AEPs, four oncologists, and one breast cancer surgeon (median 13-yr breast-cancer-specific experience) completed phase one. Eighty-four AEPs (median 5-yr experience) completed phase two. Phase one participants answered open- and close-ended questions regarding key considerations for aerobic exercise in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and what information should be collected to guide exercise prescription. All questions and considerations agreed upon in phase one (>70\u202f% rating 7-9 on a 0-9 Likert Scale) were rated by AEPs in phase two.",
        "Key considerations for exercise assessment and prescription aligned closely with exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Common strategies for exercise individualisation were identified by AEPs, including separating aerobic exercise into 5-to--9-minute bouts when required and avoiding exercising to complete exhaustion. Exercise intensity and duration should be adjusted throughout chemotherapy to improve tolerance and adherence. Novel considerations for subjective questioning and objective assessments to tailor exercise prescription were outlined.",
        "This study identifies how professionals approach exercise assessment and prescription in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Findings can guide AEPs in practice when prescribing tailored exercise to breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and inform future guidelines."
