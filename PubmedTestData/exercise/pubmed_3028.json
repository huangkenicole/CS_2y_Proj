        "The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who participated in iStep-MS, a feasibility randomised controlled trial of a behaviour change intervention that aimed to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour.",
        "A qualitative approach was undertaken embedded in the feasibility randomised controlled trial. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using Framework analysis.",
        "Participants were recruited from a single MS therapy centre in the southeast of England, UK.",
        "Sixty people with MS were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or usual care. Following a purposive sampling strategy, 15 participants from the intervention arm undertook 1:1 semi-structured interviews.",
        "The iStep-MS intervention consisted of four therapist-led sessions over 12 weeks, supported by a handbook and pedometer.",
        "Three themes were identified from the data. <i>\"I can do this\": developing competence in physical activity</i> highlights the enhanced physical activity confidence gained through goal setting and accomplishment. \"<i>I felt valued\": the nurturing culture</i> provides an overview of the supportive and non-judgemental environment created by the programme structure and therapeutic relationship. Finally, \"<i>What can I do?\": empowered enactment</i> describes the transition from the supported iStep-MS intervention to intrinsically motivated physical activity enactment.",
        "Overall, this study supports the acceptability of the iStep-MS intervention and identified key areas that supported participants to be physically active.",
