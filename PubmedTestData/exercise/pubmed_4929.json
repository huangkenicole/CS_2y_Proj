        "<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> Exergaming is promising for patients with heart failure who are less inclined to start or maintain exercise programs involving traditional modes of physical activity. Although no effect on exercise capacity was found for an off-the-shelf exergame, it is important to gain insights into aspects related to costs to develop such interventions further. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> In a randomized controlled trial, the Heart Failure Wii study (HF-Wii study), the intervention group (exergame group) received an introduction to the exergame, the exergame was installed at home and help was offered when needed for 3 months. Patients received telephone follow-ups at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the installation. The control group (motivational support group) received activity advice and telephone follow-ups at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. We collected data on hospital use and costs, costs of the exergame intervention, patient time-related costs, and willingness to pay. <b><i>Results:</i></b> No significant differences were found between the exergame group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009300) versus the motivational support group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009305) in hospital use or costs (1-year number of hospitalizations: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.60, costs: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.73). The cost of the intervention was 190 Euros, and the patient time-related costs were 98 Euros. Of the total estimated costs for the intervention, 287 Euros, patients were willing to pay, on average, 58%. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study shows that the costs of an intervention using an off-the-shelve exergame are relatively low and that the patients were willing to pay for more than half of the intervention costs. The trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01785121)."
