        "<i>Background and objectives:</i> Ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP) often develop impaired gait, and reduced active knee extension is often a part of the problem. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a combined intervention program including stretching and progressive resistance exercise (PRE) targeting active knee extension on gait function, in children with spastic CP. <i>Materials and methods:</i> Thirty-seven children (21 boys, 16 girls, mean age 10.2 (\u00b12.3) years), classified by Gross Motor Function Classification System I-III, were randomized to an intervention (<i>n</i> = 17) and a comparison group (<i>n</i> = 20). The intervention group received a 16-week combined exercise program (3 sessions per week) including stretching of hamstrings and PRE targeting the lower extremities, followed by a 16-week maintenance program (1 session per week). The comparison group received care as usual. Gait function was evaluated by three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA); knee, hip and pelvic kinematics in the sagittal plane, step length and speed, Gait Deviation Index (GDI), and Six-Minute Walk test (6MWT) at 0, 16, and 32 weeks. <i>Results:</i> There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the comparison group for any of the gait parameters measured at 16 and 32 weeks. There was a significant increase in gait distance measured by 6MWT within both groups; however, no differences between the groups were found. <i>Conclusion:</i> A 16-week combined stretching and PRE program followed by a 16-week maintenance program did not improve gait function in ambulant children with CP."
