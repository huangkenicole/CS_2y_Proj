        "The objective of this review was to investigate the effects of exercise in older adults with hyperkyphosis. Medline and Google Scholar databases were searched from June to August 2022 for studies related to exercise interventions in older adults above 60\u00a0years of age. All types of exercise interventions (such as strengthening, stretching, Yoga, and/or any other exercise with a focus on treatment or prevention of postural malalignment) were included. The keywords used were \"hyperkyphosis,\" \"exercise,\" and \"older adults.\" Ten studies were included involving 625 older adults with hyperkyphotic posture. The exercise interventions included spine strengthening (strengthening of back and abdominal muscles), poses of Yoga and postural alignment, and flexibility and respiratory muscle exercises. Duration of exercise programs varied from 6\u00a0weeks (1 study) to 8\u00a0weeks (3 studies), 12\u00a0weeks (4 studies), and 6\u00a0months (3 studies). Exercise adherence was generally good in studies. In summary, low to moderate evidence suggest that exercises in age-related hyperkyphosis have a role in the management of this group of patients. It can be beneficial in order to improve postural control, spinal stability, and kyphosis outcomes. The adherence reported across studies suggests that exercise is an acceptable treatment option for people with age-related hyperkyphosis. Types of exercise and dose-response parameters of exercise eliciting improvement warrant further investigation. Due to heterogeneity in clinical trials, future research is needed with the goal of improving the health of our growing geriatric population."
