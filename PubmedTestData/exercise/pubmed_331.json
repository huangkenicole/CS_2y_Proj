        "Core stability has a strong relationship with dynamic balance stability (DBS). The purpose of this review with meta-analysis was to analyse the effects of core training programmes from different studies on DBS. A literature search was performed using different databases. Subgroups analyses on duration, training frequency, total sessions, chronological age, training status, equipment and movements were performed. A random-effects model for meta-analyses was used. Thirteen studies were selected for the systematic review and 10 for the meta-analysis, comprising 226 participants. A moderate effect was noted for core training on DBS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; ES\u00a0=\u00a00.634). Greater DBS improvements were found in core training interventions with \u22646\u00a0weeks (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.714), after high volume (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.787) and more frequent interventions (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.787), as well as in younger participants (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.832). In addition, body weight exercises may be better than med ball, swiss ball or band resisted exercises. Core training improves DBS among athletes and a non-trained population, creating a more solid stable base that allows better lower extremity movements. This could be more effective considering different modulators \u22646\u00a0weeks intervention, >2 sessions per week, >17 total sessions, body weight core programmes and applied to \u226418.0\u00a0years old."
