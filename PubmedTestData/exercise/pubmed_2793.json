        "Balance is crucial in performing functional tasks particularly among older adults. Exergaming is gaining attention as a novel approach to enhance balance in a number of clinical populations.",
        "The aim of this review was to synthesize and present published evidence for Nintendo Wii Fit\u2122 gaming system protocols. These include game preference, intervention setting, and exercise dosage for improving balance in healthy older adults. Commonly used outcome measures were also identified.",
        "A literature search was developed using the PICOS strategy using keywords such as \"older adult,\" \"Nintendo Wii Fit,\" \"exergaming,\" and \"balance\" in the databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science.",
        "Sixteen articles were included with participants (n\u2009=\u2009491) mostly female (69%), and mean age ranged between 71 and 85 years old. Participants were recruited mainly from the community. The most commonly used Wii Fit games were Table tilt, Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, and Ski jump, performed three times per week, with a duration of 30 minutes per session for 6 weeks. Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, and Centre of Pressure were the most commonly used outcome measures.",
        "Wii Fit exergames can be a potential alternative to improve balance if safety and technical procedures are provided. With conflicting and mechanism-based evidence on dosage presented, exergaming parameters require further research before firm recommendations can be made. Clinically, effective dosage is an important component in any type of interventions, and exergaming should not be an exception."
