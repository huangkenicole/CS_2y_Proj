        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 16\u00a0weeks of combined exercise training (CET) on muscle strength, body composition, depression, anxiety and quality of life of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Twenty-three participants completed the study, 14 in trained group (TG) and 9 in control group (CG). TG consisted of resistance and aerobic training three times a week, while the CG was exposed to recreational activities twice a week. CET promoted increased muscle strength (25% in overall strength) and aerobic capacity (+\u200920% in training speed and +\u200923% in VO<sub>2</sub> during aerobic training; p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, TG had better quality of life and reduced depression rates (from 7 subjects with mild, moderate or severe depression to 1 post-training). In conclusion, this pilot data demonstrated that 16\u00a0weeks of CET increased muscle strength, and improved depression and quality of life indexes in a small sample of PLHIV."
