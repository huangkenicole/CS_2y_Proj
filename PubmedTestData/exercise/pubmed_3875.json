        "Walking and balance capabilities can be improved upon using repetitive ankle dorsiflexion exercises. Here we developed two types of pedal switches incorporated with training devices to improve their walking and balance performance of children with cerebral palsy. The first type of pedal switch can be used to operate a home appliance, while the second type of pedal switch can connect them to web games. Pedal switches can be used for home rehabilitation. This randomized controlled trial included patients in the intervention (n = 24) and control (n = 24) groups who completed 15 weeks of ankle training. The experimental group performed ankle dorsiflexion using a pressure-activated pedal switch connected to the web games. The control group performed ankle dorsiflexion exercises using a pedal switch that operated a home appliance (a fan). Standing balance and walking performance were estimated using the Zebris FDM system, a pressure force platform, the Pediatric Balance Scale score, and the 1-minute walk test. The pre- and posttest data were analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, which revealed that the intervention group had more significant improvements in sway patterns and balance and walking. The developed facility of a modified pedal switch integrated with web games can achieve better exercise adherence to promote balance and walking performance than that with home appliances. Maintaining motivation in children with cerebral palsy plays a very important role in the rehabilitation process."
