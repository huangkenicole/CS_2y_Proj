        "Many overlapping factors impair motor performance and quality of life in neurological patients. Eccentric resistance training (ET) has potential benefits for improving motor performance and treating motor impairments better than some traditional rehabilitation approaches.",
        "To estimate the effect of ET in neurological settings.",
        "Seven databases were reviewed up to May 2022 according to PRSIMA guidelines to find randomized clinical trials involving adults with a neurological condition, who underwent ET as set by the American College of Sports Medicine. Motor performance (main outcome) was assessed as strength, power and capacities during activity. Secondary outcomes (impairments) were muscle structure, flexibility, muscle activity, tone, tremor, balance and fatigue. Tertiary outcomes were risk of fall, and self-reports of quality of life.",
        "Ten trials were included, assessed using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and used to compute meta-analyses. Effective effects in favour of ET were found for strength and power, but not for capacities during activity. Mixed results were found for secondary and tertiary outcomes.",
        "ET may be a promising intervention to better improve strength/power in neurological patients. More studies are needed to improve the quality of evidence underlying changes responsible for these results."
