      "AbstractText": [
        "Physical therapist intervention studies can be deemed ineffective when, in fact, they may not have been delivered as intended. Measurement of treatment fidelity (TF) can address this issue. The purpose of this study was to describe TF of a home-based intervention, identify factors associated with TF, and examine whether components of TF were associated with the outcome of change in 6-minute walk distance (\u22066MWD).",
        "This is a secondary analysis of community-dwelling hip fracture participants who completed standard therapy and were randomly assigned to the active intervention (Push). Push was 16 weeks of lower extremity strengthening, function, and endurance training. TF was defined as delivery (attendance rate, exercise duration) and receipt (progression in training load, heart rate reserve [HRR] during endurance training, and exercise position [exercise on floor]). The outcome was \u22066MWD. Independent variables included baseline (demographic and clinical) measures. Descriptive statistics were calculated; linear and logistic regressions were performed.",
        "Eighty-nine participants were included in this analysis; 59 (66%) had attendance of 75% or greater. Participants walked for 20\u00a0minutes or more for 78% of sessions. The average training load increased by 22%; the mean HRR was 35%; and 61 (69%) participants exercised on the floor for at least 75% of sessions. Regression analyses showed that a higher body mass index and greater baseline 6MWD were related to components of TF; 4 out of 5 components of TF were significantly related to \u22066MWD. The strongest TF relationship showed that those who exercised on the floor improved by 62 m (95% CI = 31-93 m) more than those who did not get on the floor.",
        "Measures of TF should extend beyond attendance rate. This analysis demonstrates how measures of TF, including program attendance, progression in training load, endurance duration, and exercising on the floor were significantly related to improvement in 6MWD in participants post hip fracture.",
        "This careful analysis of treatment fidelity assured that the intervention was delivered and received as intended. Analysis of data from a large trial with participants after hip fracture showed that regular attendance, frequent endurance training for 20\u00a0minutes, increases in lower extremity training loads, and exercising on the floor were associated with improvements in the outcome of 6-minute-walk distance. The strongest association with improvement was exercising on the floor."
