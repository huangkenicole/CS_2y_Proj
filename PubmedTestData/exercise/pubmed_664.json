        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise training on cardiac function in heart failure (HF) patients recently suffering from acute decompensation. Radionuclide ambulatory ventricular function monitoring (VEST) was used to detect variations in cardiac hemodynamics during training period.",
        "This was a monocentric, randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 72 HF patients [left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%] within two weeks after acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema: 40 in the elderly group, 32 in the middle-aged group. Trained patients underwent a specific four-weeks exercise program (closed-chain resistive activities and abdominal exercises) which was supervised by a therapist in agreement with patients' characteristics. Catecholamines at rest, echocardiography, right-heart catheterization, and bicycle ergometer were performed. VEST was performed at the end of the 4weeks-training in all patients in order to assess patients' cardiac hemodynamics [LVEF, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume].",
        "Exercise training significantly improved exercise duration, peak oxygen consumption, and ventilatory threshold both in elderly and middle-aged patients (p<0.0001) after the 4-week controlled training. Despite age (F=35.086, p<0.0001; F=16.967, p<0.0001; F=42.574, p=0.03, respectively), training reliably influence previous cardiopulmonary parameters (F=29.402, F=16.421, F=26.80, p<0.0001, respectively). Norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly reduced in both trained groups. Peak LVEF (37.3\u00b14.7% vs 34\u00b16.2%, p=0.002), peak stroke volume (43.3\u00b13.9% vs 37.5\u00b14.3%, p=0.001), and peak CO (63.4\u00b16.1% vs 48.2\u00b14.7%, p<0.0001) increased in middle-aged patients after 4-week training.",
