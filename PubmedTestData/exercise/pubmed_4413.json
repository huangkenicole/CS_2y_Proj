        "There is growing evidence that exercise provides benefit in treating motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).",
        "The aims of this study were to determine (a) whether a 5-week PD-specific program resulted in sustained physical and psychosocial benefits, and (b) the relationship between patient characteristics, exercise, falls and physical and psychosocial parameters.",
        "Single-centre prospective observational study.",
        "A total of 135 consecutive patients with mild-to-moderate PD underwent a 5-week PD-specific education and exercise program from August 2013 to March 2015. Gait, mobility and psychosocial measures were compared at baseline, 6\u00a0weeks and 12\u00a0months.",
        "Significant improvements in physical (walking distance in 2\u00a0minutes, number of \"Sit To Stands\" in 30\u00a0seconds, time in seconds taken to \"Timed Up and Go,\" fast gait velocity over 10\u00a0m, Berg Balance Scale [BBS]) and psychosocial (quality of life (QoL) [PDQ-39], depression and anxiety [DASS-21], and fatigue [PSF-16]) measures were seen at 6\u00a0weeks (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) with physical improvements sustained at 12\u00a0months (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The number of patients at 12\u00a0months with \u22651 fall reduced from 66% to 33%, and the number not exercising reduced from 42% to 21%. A lack of exercise correlated with \u22651 fall at 12\u00a0months (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.36-8.39, P\u00a0=\u00a0.009). It was also associated with poorer balance and psychosocial parameters at 12\u00a0months (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).",
        "Patients recruited into a 5-week Parkinson's disease education and exercise program achieved significant 12-month benefits in physical but not psychosocial measures. Patients with \u22651 fall post-treatment were less likely to have been exercising at 12-month follow-up."
