        "Guidelines for a comprehensive rehabilitation programme for patellofemoral pain (PFP) have been developed by international experts. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of such a rehabilitative exercise programme on pain, function, kinesiophobia, running biomechanics, quadriceps strength and quadriceps muscle inhibition in individuals with PFP.",
        "Observational study.",
        "Clinical environment.",
        "Twenty-seven participants with PFP.",
        "Symptoms [numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)and the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)], function measured by using the KUJALA scale and KOOS, kinesiophobia measured by using the Tampa scale, three-dimensional biomechanical running data, quadriceps isometric, concentric and eccentric strength and arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) were acquired before and after the six-week exercise programme.",
        "Although pain did not significantly improve all patients were pain-free after the six-week exercise programme (NPRS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.074). Function, kinesiophobia and quadriceps AMI improved significantly after the six-week exercise programme (KUJALA: p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, KOOS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001, Tampa: p\u00a0=\u00a00.017, AMI: p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Running biomechanics during stance phase did not change after the exercise intervention. Quadriceps strength was not different after the six-week exercise programme (isometric: p\u00a0=\u00a00.992, concentric: p\u00a0=\u00a00.075, eccentric: p\u00a0=\u00a00.351).",
        "The results of this study demonstrate that the current exercise recommendations can improve function and kinesiophobia and reduce pain and AMI in individuals with PFP. There is a need for reconsideration of the current exercise guidelines in stronger individuals with PFP."
