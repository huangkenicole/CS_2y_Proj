        "Thirty-seven patients who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were tested in a gait analysis laboratory at 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. Between test sessions, patients were randomly assigned to a course of either closed or open kinetic chain resistance exercises (3 sessions per week for 4 weeks). Gait analysis consisted of bilateral calculations of knee joint angle, moment, and power during level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent. An analysis of variance on the effects of training group and test session indicated that the only variable to be significantly affected by the type of exercise program was the amount of knee flexion at the beginning of step-up (P < 0.05). All other measures of knee angle, moment, and power (16 total variables) showed no significant difference between the exercise groups. All variables measured on the injured side showed significant improvement from test 1 to test 2 (P < 0.05), but the injured leg remained functionally deficient when compared with the uninjured leg. These data suggest that there are no clinically significant differences in the functional improvement resulting from the choice of open or closed kinetic chain exercises in the early period after this surgery."
