        "We describe the case of a 50-y-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who underwent pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The 8-wk training program, including resistance training and aerobic exercises, was conducted 3 d/wk under physiotherapist supervision. Clinical and functional assessment was performed prior to and following the program. At the end of the training program, meaningful improvements in primary outcomes, including spirometry values and exertional parameters, were noted.",
        "Pulmonary rehabilitation may represent a valid treatment in the management of symptoms in patients with IPF. Although the current guidelines for diagnosis and management of IPF recommend the use of PR programs, patients are not routinely referred to PR centers and exercise training for these patients is not standardized.",
        "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease characterized by the loss of lung function, which results in a severe impairment of daily activities. Prospective studies testing the effectiveness of PR programs in larger cohorts of patients are still lacking. Furthermore, a standardization of pulmonary training programs should be developed to better understand the benefit of PR."
