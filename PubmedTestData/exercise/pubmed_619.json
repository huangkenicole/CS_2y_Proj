        "This study aims to preliminarily evaluate effect on physical properties of shoulder joints and cognitive function after practicing Rue-si-dad-ton, a Thai traditional exercise using the postures of the hermit doing body contortion which still lacks systematically conducted evidence-based regarding its benefits.",
        "Thirty-seven participants who have routinely worked on computer at least 3 hours per day were recruited and randomized into intervention (n = 19) or control group (n = 18). Physical effect on shoulder joints was evaluated by measuring shoulder range of motion (ROM) and evaluating shoulder function with the American Shoulder & Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form. Cognitive function was determined by Verbal Fluency Test, Trail Maker B Test, and Digit Span Test. Both study groups were assessed by all tests at the beginning and at the end of study by blinded assessors. The intervention group performed 3 postures of Rue-si-dad-ton exercise (an hour per day for 4 days by a well-trained instructor) before thefinal measurement.",
        "Only left and right shoulder flexion of the intervention group (p-value = 0.006 and 0.010 respectively) showed significant increment compared with the control group using ANCOVA test with baseline adjusted as covariate. Other variables, including joint and cognitive function, indicated no significant changes between groups. No complications from exercise were found during the study",
        "Rue-si-dad-ton may safely help improve range of joint motion with potential benefit for joint and cognitive function. Additional extensive studies with adequate number of participants and longer period of exercise are warranted."
