      "AbstractText": [
        "Interest in eccentric exercises has increased over the last decades due to its efficiency in achieving moderate-high intensity muscular work with reduced metabolic demands. However, individualizing eccentric exercises in rehabilitation contexts remains challenging, as concentric exercises mainly rely on cardiovascular parameters. To overcome this, perceived exertion could serve as an individualization tool, but the knowledge about cardiovascular responses to eccentric cycling based on perceived exertion are still scarce. For this purpose, the cardiorespiratory parameters of 26 participants were assessed during two 5 min bouts of concentric cycling at 30 and 60 rpm and two bouts of eccentric cycling at 15 and 30 rpm matched for rating of perceived exertion. With this method, we hypothesized higher exercise efficiency during eccentric cycling for a same perceived exertion. The results revealed significantly elevated heart rate and cardiac index at higher pedalling rates during concentric (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but not during eccentric cycling (<i>p</i> \u2248 1). Exercise efficiency was higher during concentric cycling (64%), decreasing with pedalling rate, while eccentric cycling exhibited increased work rates (82%), and increased by over 100% with higher pedalling rate. Hence, eccentric cycling, with lower cardiorespiratory work for the same perceived exertion, facilitates higher work rates in deconditioned populations. However, further studies are needed for effective individualization."
