        "The Physical Activity Guidelines recommend performing 150 min of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (MVPA) per week. These guidelines also recommend muscle-strengthening physical activity (MSPA) on \u22652 d\u00b7wk-1 for additional benefits including muscular fitness and bone health. The majority of the scientific evidence supporting the PA recommendations for health comes from studies of MVPA while the possible contributions of MSPA in these findings have been overlooked historically. Emerging evidence suggests that MSPA can independently protect against major cardiometabolic risk factors, chronic diseases, and mortality. Additional data from clinical trials indicate that many of the well-known health benefits of exercise, like improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors, are more robust with combined MVPA and MSPA. This review will clarify the relative benefits of MSPA versus MVPA on health-related outcomes to determine the best type of PA for health."
