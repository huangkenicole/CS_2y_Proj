      "AbstractText": [
        "The elastic tubes have been used for clinical rehabilitation programs in which exercises are performed with submaximal intensities due to the difficulty in the measure the applied force. The authors aimed to quantify the elastic constant of elastic tubes used in neuromuscular rehabilitation programs predicting the force related to elastic tube elongation. A force test was performed by stretching the elastic tubes to determine the relationship between force and elongation. Eight elastic tubes with progressive levels of resistance represented by colors (yellow, red, blue, gray, black, grape, purple, and gold-low to higher resistance) were used.",
        "Experimental.",
        "The test and retest were compared using the paired t test. The agreement and reliability between the test versus retest of pooled means colors were analyzed by plotting the Bland-Altman graph and intraclass correlation coefficient and the coefficient of variation. Pearson correlation was used to verify the validity between measurements.",
        "The force values generated from the elastic tube elongation increase according to the color and thickness of elastic tubes with a strong and significant association between them (P < .0001). The elastic constant measurements were similar and presented high intraclass correlation coefficient values, low coefficient of variation values, and were reproducible (P < .0001).",
        "The force could be quantified according to elastic tube length variation by the linear regression equation with reproducibility. It gives greater measurement precision and better training load control when using elastic tubes in strength training programs."
