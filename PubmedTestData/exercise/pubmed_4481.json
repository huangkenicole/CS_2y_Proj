        "The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of adding either aerobic training (AT) or resistance training (RT) to a multidisciplinary teamed (MDT) educational weight management programme on the health-related fitness of morbidly obese individuals. Males (n\u2009=\u20099) and females (n\u2009=\u200924) aged between 24 and 68\u2009years with a body mass index (BMI) of \u226540\u2009kg\u2009m(2) (\u226535\u2009kg\u2009m(2) with comorbidities) undertaking a weight management programme were recruited (Completion: M\u2009=\u20098, F\u2009=\u200919). Participants were randomly allocated to either AT (n\u2009=\u200912), RT (n\u2009=\u200911) or CON (n\u2009=\u200910). AT and RT undertook three structured \u223c60\u2009min moderate intensity sessions weekly, two supervised gym-based and one structured home-based session for 12\u2009weeks; CON undertook usual care alone. Anthropometric, psychological and functional capacity measures were obtained pre- and post-intervention. Both exercise interventions elicited improvements compared with CON in the: shuttle walk test (AT [\u0394 207.0\u2009\u00b1\u2009123.0 metres, 68.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.04], RT [\u0394 165.0\u2009\u00b1\u2009183.3\u2009m, 48.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.06], CON [\u0394 -14.3\u2009\u00b1\u200938.7\u2009m, -6.2%]), triceps skin-fold (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), self-efficacy (P\u2009=\u20090.005) and interest/enjoyment (P\u2009=\u20090.006). RT displayed additional improvements compared with CON in BMI (RT [\u0394 -1.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91\u2009kg\u00b7m(2) , -2.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.033], AT [\u0394 -1.84\u2009\u00b1\u20092.70\u2009kg\u00b7m(2) , -4.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.142], CON [\u0394 -0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.47\u2009kg\u00b7m(2) , -0.6%]), waist circumference (P\u2009=\u20090.022), competence (P\u2009=\u20090.019), biceps skin-fold (P\u2009=\u20090.012) and medial calf skin-fold (P\u2009=\u20090.013). No significant differences were observed between exercise modalities. Regardless of exercise mode, the addition of supervised and structured exercise to a MDT weight management programme significantly improved anthropometric, functional and psychological measures in obese participants with a BMI of \u226535\u2009kg\u00b7m(2) ."
