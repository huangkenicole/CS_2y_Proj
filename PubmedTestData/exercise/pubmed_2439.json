        "The aims of this study were to compare the effects of a multicomponent exercise program provided at a center (CB) versus done part at home and part at a center (H+CB) on frailty status, strength, physical function, and gait of prefrail older women. Twenty-five women were randomly allocated into the CB (n = 14; 69 \u00b1 6 years) and the H+CB (n = 11; 69 \u00b1 7 years) groups. Both groups completed an exercise program including strengthening, balance, and gait exercises. The program was 12 weeks long, done three times per week, for 60\u00a0min per session. Frailty, knee and hip muscle strength, spatiotemporal parameters of the usual and maximum speed dual-task gait, and physical function were assessed at baseline and after program completion. The exercise program reversed the prefrail status of most participants independently of the mode of delivery. Strength increased in both groups, but the CB group had more pronounced improvements in gait and physical function. H+CB exercise programs are good options for prefrail older women."
