        "To examine the effect of participating in a 12-week supervised exercise training (ET) program on physical activity and body composition in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
        "Randomized controlled trial assessing physical activity and body composition at baseline, after 12-week intervention, and at 11 months follow-up.",
        "Outpatient hospital.",
        "Patients with IPF (N=34; mean age, 68\u00b18y) recruited for this study; 32 patients completed the 12-week intervention (ET group: n=15; control group: n=17) and 28 patients (14 in each group) reassessed at 11-month follow-up from baseline.",
        "Participation in a 12-week supervised ET program or regular medical treatment.",
        "Changes in physical activity levels as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.",
        "After the 12-week intervention, physical activity levels were significantly increased in the ET group whereas the control group showed a trend toward deterioration (median difference between the groups, 2164MET-min/wk [interquartile range, 1576MET-min/wk]; MET = metabolic equivalent; P<.001). Body composition was also significantly improved in the ET group, whereas the control group showed an opposite trend. At 11-month follow-up, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in all variables. The ET group lost most of the achieved improvements in the outcomes and returned to near baseline levels, whereas the control group showed a trend toward worsened outcomes.",
        "Physical activity and body composition in patients with IPF were improved after a 12-week supervised ET program, although the benefits were not sustained at 11-month follow-up. These results may support the efficacy of participation in supervised ET to improve physical activity and body composition in patients with IPF; however, maintenance strategies are warranted to preserve the improved outcomes."
