        "The aim of this randomized controlled study was to investigate the effect of soft-tissue mobilization in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).",
        "Twenty-one patients (mean age 44.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.40\u00a0years) were randomly divided into two groups. There were 13 patients (11 females, 2 males, age 43.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.94\u00a0years) in the intervention group and 8 patients (5 females, 3 males, age 46.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.67\u00a0years) in the control group. In the intervention group, soft-tissue mobilization therapy and 20 spinal mobility exercises were applied. The control group received only 20 spinal mobility exercises. The Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), and Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI) were used for assessment of disease activity, functional level, and mobility, respectively. Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for quality of life and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) were used to determine disability levels.",
        "We found significant differences between pretreatment and post-treatment scores of BASDAI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049); BASFI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009; lateral lumbar flexion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), maximal intermalleolar distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and total score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) of BASMI; pain subtest (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036) and total score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036) of NHP; and RMDQ score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) in the intervention group. However, in the control group the BASMI score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049) was observed to worsen significantly. Delta values were compared and differences in BASFI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.039), and in lateral lumbar flexion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027), maximal intermalleolar distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) and total score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) of BASMI were significant in favor of intervention group. Only tragus-to-wall distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.039) of BASMI was observed to worsen significantly in the control group.",
        "We recommend the use of soft-tissue mobilization in addition to the exercises to treat AS patients."
