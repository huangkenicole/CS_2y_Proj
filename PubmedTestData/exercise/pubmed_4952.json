        "Surfing has become a popular, non-age dependent sport that can be performed at most beaches. Hence, coaches and athletes have recognised the importance of physical preparation to enhance athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a sport-specific, land-based-home exercise programme (LB-HEP) on sport-specific assessments related to surfing performance in recreational surfers. Twenty-two year-round recreational surfers divided into two groups: the exercise group (EG) performed the LB-HEP 3 times a week for 8\u2009weeks while the control group (CG) maintained their current exercise. Both groups were instructed to continue surfing during the study period. Each surfer completed sport-specific measurements related to surfing demands both pre-test and post-test (8\u2009weeks). There was a significant interactive effect of time and group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.009, \u03b7<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> =.298) on the surfer's performance questionnaire showing greater improvements in the EG. Additionally, the EG had an improvement on time to pop-up when compared to the CG (\u03b7<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> =.160). Based on the results, the LB-HEP is an effective training programme for all experience levels of recreational surfers to improve surfing performance measures short term."
