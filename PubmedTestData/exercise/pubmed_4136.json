      "AbstractText": [
        "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The physiological and psychological benefits of physical activity have been shown in children with cancer. However, almost one in two cancer patients do not follow the physical activity guidelines. The aim of this study will be to assess the feasibility of a physical activity program intervention in pediatric oncology and to assess the barriers and facilitators to the success or failure of this physical activity program.",
        "The VIE (valorization, implication, and education) intervention is a multidisciplinary program including physical activity, nutritional, and psychological interventions in pediatric oncology. This study involves one intervention group that will be followed over 2\u00a0years (evaluations and physical activity interventions) and one control group that will participate in only one evaluation. Children from the intervention group have been diagnosed and will be undergoing treatment at the Charles-Bruneau oncology center from the Sainte-Justine University Health Center (Montreal, Canada). The feasibility of this program will be measured through a comparison between sessions performed and sessions scheduled, while the security will be measured according to the number of reported incidents.",
        "This study will examine the effects of exercise in pediatric oncology from diagnosis to the expected end of treatment (i.e., 2\u00a0years of follow-up). Currently, there are only a few longitudinal studies on physical activity and pediatric cancer. Physiological and psychological tests will allow a better knowledge of the evolution of the physical fitness and mental health of the patients during the period of care. It is necessary to document and provide complementary knowledge in the pediatric oncology field in order to engage the discourse with pediatric oncology health professionals to help patients during and after treatment. This is an important study in the exercise and oncology field to help patients and their family during and after cancer treatments."
