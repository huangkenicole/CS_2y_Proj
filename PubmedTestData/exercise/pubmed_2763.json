        "Physical exercise is known to improve the level of activities of daily living and physical function in people with dementia; however, symptoms of dementia often pose challenges when implementing physical therapy. This study aimed to elucidate how physiotherapists (PTs) engage with older adults with dementia to encourage exercise and participation in physical activity.",
        "In this qualitative study, four PTs working with older adults with dementia in long-term care facilities in Japan were recruited and interviewed. We used a modified grounded theory approach to assess how PTs engaged with older adults with dementia during physiotherapy sessions.",
        "Based on PT responses, five categories of engagement were identified: \"make structured preparations for clients to begin physical activity,\" \"link exercise therapy to a client's daily life,\" \"discover changes in daily life,\" \"ascertain cognitive function,\" and \"accommodate client differences.\" Concepts were derived under each category. The category \"make structured preparations for clients to begin physical activity\" served as a preceding stage for PTs to engage with older adults with dementia. PTs linked exercise therapy to each client's daily life activities to encourage voluntary participation in daily physical activity. PTs ensured the performance of routine patterns of movement and modified these movement patterns per clients' differing paces.",
        "PTs provided exercise and movement training based on various degrees of client involvement and made structured preparations for clients to begin physical activity that were linked to exercise therapy. Our findings may prompt PTs to encourage older people with dementia to participate in physical therapy and benefit from exercise."
