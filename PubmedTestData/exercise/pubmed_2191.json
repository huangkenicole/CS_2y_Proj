        "Telerehabilitation is becoming increasingly valuable as a method for expanding medical services. The smartphone-based mHealth platform (SMPT) has been developed to provide high-quality remote rehabilitation through a smartphone and inertial measurement units. The SMPT uses smartphone as a main platform with connection to medical backend server to provide telerehabilitation. Patients would be referred to therapists to receive a tutorial of exercise technique prior to conducting their home exercise. Once patients begin their home exercises, they can report any problems instantly through the SMPT. The medical staff can adjust the exercise program according to patient feedback and the data collected by the SMPT. After completing the exercise program, patients visit their clinician for re-evaluation. A Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire from both medical professional and public perspective revealed a high level of agreement on enhanced care, increased accessibility, and satisfaction and a moderate level of agreement on the use of this platform as a substitute for traditional rehabilitation. Concerns about privacy and discomfort were low in the medical professional and public groups. Concerns about care personnel were also significantly different between the two groups. The SMPT is a promising system for providing telerehabilitation as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation, which may result in improved outcomes compared with those achieved when using traditional rehabilitation alone."
