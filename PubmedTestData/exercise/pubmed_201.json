      "AbstractText": [
        "After injury, eccentric exercise of the injured limb is often contraindicated. Cross-education training, whereby the uninvolved limb is exercised, is an alternative that may improve quadriceps muscle strength and activation in the unexercised limb.",
        "To determine the effect of eccentric exercise on quadriceps strength and activation gains in the unexercised limb.",
        "Eighteen healthy individuals were randomly assigned to an eccentric training group or a control group.",
        "Quadriceps strength and activation measures were collected at preintervention, midintervention, and postintervention. Eccentric training participants exercised their dominant limb with a dynamometer in eccentric mode at 60\u00b0/s, 3 times per week for 8 weeks.",
        "Quadriceps strength was quantified at 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0/s in concentric and eccentric modes. Quadriceps activation was assessed using the burst superimposition technique and quantified via the central activation ratio. A 2 \u00d7 3 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to detect the effects of group and testing session on quadriceps strength and activation. Where appropriate, post hoc Bonferroni multiple-comparisons procedures were used.",
        "We found greater eccentric strength in the unexercised limbs of eccentric training participants between preintervention and midintervention and between preintervention and postintervention (preintervention to midintervention: 30\u00b0/s P = .05; preintervention to postintervention: 30\u00b0/s P = .02, 60\u00b0/s P = .02). No differences were noted in concentric strength (P > .05). An overall trend toward greater quadriceps activation in the unexercised knee was detected between preintervention and postintervention (P = .063), with the eccentric training group demonstrating a strong effect (Cohen d = 0.83). Control strength did not change (P > .05).",
        "Exercising with eccentric actions resulted in mode-specific and velocity-specific gains in quadriceps strength in the unexercised limb. A trend toward greater quadriceps activation in the unexercised knee was noted, suggesting that strength gains may have occurred because of enhanced neural activity. This type of therapy may be a useful addition to rehabilitation programs designed to improve quadriceps strength."
