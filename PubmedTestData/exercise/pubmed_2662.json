        "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the application of isometric horizontal abduction (IHA) differentially affected two weight-bearing push-up plus exercises by examining activation of the scapulothoracic muscles in subjects with scapular winging. Fifteen male subjects performed standard push-up plus (SPP) and wall push-up plus (WPP), with and without IHA. Two-way analyses of variance using two within-subject factors were used to determine the statistical significance of observed differences in upper trapezius (UT), pectoralis major (PM), and serratus anterior (SA) muscle activities and UT/SA and PM/SA muscle activity ratios. UT and SA muscle activities were greater during SPP than WPP. PM muscle activity was lower with IHA application. The UT/SA and PM/SA muscle activity ratios were lower during SPP than WPP. The PM/SA muscle activity ratio was lower with IHA application. The results suggest that IHA application using a Thera-Band can effectively reduce PM muscle activity during SPP and WPP exercises. Moreover, the SPP exercise can be used to increase UT and SA muscle activity and reduce the UT/SA and PM/SA muscle activity ratios in subjects with scapular winging."
