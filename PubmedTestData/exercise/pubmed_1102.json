        "The aim: To develop, substantiate and experimentally test the methodology for the development of coordination abilities in 6-10 years old boys with postural disorders during their physical education training sessions.",
        "Materials and methods: The experimental (EG) and the control groups (CG) were formed to organize the pedagogical experiment. The EG included 17 boys and the CG consisted of 19 boys. The EG was engaged in sports activities according the developed methodology and the CG followed the current school curricula on physical education.",
        "Results: The methodology for the development of coordination abilities in 6-10 years old boys with postural disorders in the process of their physical education has been developed. Its peculiarity lies in the accentuated influence on the vestibular, motor and visual analyzers with the help of a system of exercises aimed at controlling movements in space in static positions and during movement.",
        "Conclusions: The obtained results testify to the effectiveness of the developed methodology. The EG boys had significantly higher indicators of static balance and coordination abilities at body position change, as well as general coordination of movements (p \u2264 0.05) at the end of the academic year than those of the CG. In addition, the number of 6-10 years old boys with various postural disorders decreased by 7.4 % (from 26.8 % to 19.4 %)."
