        "This study aimed to examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of presurgical exercise in patients with bladder cancer scheduled for open radical cystectomy with follow-up postsurgery.",
        "Prospective single-group design with assessments at baseline, presurgery, and 3 months postsurgery was used in this study. Multimodal supervised resistance and aerobic exercise was undertaken 2-3 d\u00b7wk -1 at moderate intensity for a median of 3.5 wk (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3-5.6). Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and completion rates, patient safety, program tolerance, adherence, and compliance. Lean and fat mass were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, physical function by a battery of tests (chest press and leg press strength, 6-min walk test [6MWT], timed up-and-go, repeated chair rise), and quality of life (QoL), psychological distress, and body image by questionnaire. Hospital length of stay (LOS) and complications were assessed by medical records.",
        "Thirty-seven patients were referred with 20 recruited (67.3 \u00b1 12.2 yr) and a presurgery intervention completion rate of 80% (16 of 20). The individual median program adherence was 100.0% (IQR = 89.4-100.0) with compliance of 100.0% (IQR = 90.5-100.0) for resistance exercise and 81.8% (IQR = 55.0-99.5) for aerobic exercise. There were no exercise-related adverse events. Body composition did not change presurgery; however, there were improvements ( P < 0.05) in leg press strength (16%), 6MWT distance (8%), timed up-and-go (12%), chair rise (10%), and multiple QoL domains including mental health. Median LOS was 8.0 d (IQR = 7.0, 15.0). Postsurgery, there were declines in components of QoL and apparent body image dissatisfaction.",
        "A preradical cystectomy exercise program is feasible, safe, and well tolerated with improvements in physical function and QoL. Supervised multimodal exercise in bladder cancer patients before cystectomy can enhance physical and mental health potentially buffering the effects of surgery."
