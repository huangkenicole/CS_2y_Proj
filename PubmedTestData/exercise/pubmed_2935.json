      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to compare the neuromuscular activation of selected core musculature in supine and prone bridge exercises under stable versus suspended conditions. Forty-three healthy male participants were recruited to measure the electromyographic activities of the rectus abdominis (RA), lumbar multifidus (LM), thoracic erector spinae (TES), rectus femoris (RF), gluteus maximus (GM), and biceps femoris (BF) during supine and prone bridge exercises under six conditions: control, both arms and feet on the floor (Prone<sub>con</sub> and Supine<sub>con</sub>); arms on the floor and feet on the suspension system (Prone-Feet<sub>suspension</sub> and Supine-Feet<sub>suspension</sub>); and arms on the suspension system and feet on the floor (Prone-Arm<sub>suspension</sub> and Supine-Arm<sub>suspension</sub>). Prone-Arm<sub>suspension</sub> yielded significantly higher activities in the RA, RF, TES, and LM than Prone-Feet<sub>suspension</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and Prone<sub>con</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, Supine-Feet<sub>suspension</sub> elicited significantly higher activities in the RA, RF, TES, LM, and BF than Supine-Arm<sub>suspension</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and Supine<sub>con</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, Supine-Feet<sub>suspension</sub> elicited significantly higher activities in the RF, TES, and BF than Supine<sub>con</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Therefore, if the RA and/or RF were the target training muscles, then Prone-Arm<sub>suspension</sub> was recommended. However, if the TES, LM, and/or BF were the target training muscles, then Supine-Feet<sub>suspension</sub> was recommended."
