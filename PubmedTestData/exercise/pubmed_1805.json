        "More research is needed to uncover the effectiveness of combined strength and foam-rolling interventions to prevent running-related injuries.",
        "To evaluate effectiveness of an 18-week general strength and foam-rolling intervention on the incidence of running-related injuries.",
        "This is an 18-week observational comparative study. A total of 433 recreational runners participated (n\u00a0=\u00a0203 female). The intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a0228) performed general strength and foam-rolling exercises twice weekly for 18\u2009weeks, the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a0205) maintained their regular training habits. Running volume and running-related pain were reported weekly. Secondary analyses were performed on the subgroups of the intervention group based on compliance; low compliance (n\u00a0=\u00a0100), intermediate compliance (n\u00a0=\u00a063), and high compliance (n\u00a0=\u00a065). Cumulative incidence proportions were calculated and time-to-event statistics were performed to compare survival times between groups. Univariate cox proportional hazards ratio was calculated to estimate the risk of running-related injuries at 18\u2009weeks.",
        "A total of 100 running-related injuries were sustained. The cumulative incidence proportion for the control and intervention groups was 27.1% (95% CI: 21.4-33.9) and 23.0% (95% CI: 17.8-29.4), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the overall intervention group and control group (log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.31). A significant difference existed between the high-compliance subgroup and the control group (log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.00). Highly compliant runners were 85% less likely (hazard rate ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.15; 95% CI: 0.05-0.46) to sustain an injury during the study compared with controls.",
        "Recreational runners highly compliant with the intervention were 85% less likely and took on average 57\u2009days longer to sustain a running-related injury when compared with controls, with a cumulative incidence proportion of 4.6% after 18\u2009weeks."
