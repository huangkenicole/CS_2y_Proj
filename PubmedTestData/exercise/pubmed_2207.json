        "Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that needs consistent exercise and an accurate understanding of the condition for long-term maintenance. While the accessibility of outpatient care is essential for disease management, many patients lack the resources to receive adequate healthcare. To address this challenge, we developed a not-for-profit interactive mobile application that provides a disease-specific educational background and a structured exercise regimen to patients.",
        "\"Rak Kao\" (English translation: Love-Your-Knee) mobile application was designed to analyze the questionnaire data to assess the stage of knee OA and generate a personalized recommendation of treatment and exercise type using rule-based and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. A single-blinded study was conducted with patients (n\u2009=\u200982) who were randomly assigned to the mobile application group (M-group) and the handout group (H-group). Patient groups were controlled for age, gender, BMI, onset of pain, grade of disease, education level, and occupation. Accuracy in performance of three prescribed knee exercises (catch-bend-down, stretch-touch-feet, and sit-stretch-hold) was evaluated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated before and after the 4-weeks program to assess the range of motion, symptoms, pain, physical activity, and quality of life via the KOOS and KSS scores.",
        "Completion of the study led to significantly more overall exercise accuracy in the M-group (76.2%) than the H-group (52.5%). Activities of daily life, quality of life, ability to do sports and recreational activities were significantly more improved in the M-group than the H-group (p\u2009<\u2009.01). No difference in the range of motion between groups. Satisfaction of patients' experience was higher in the M-group than the H-group (p\u2009=\u2009.001) after the 4-week regimen.",
        "With the better accuracy and outcomes for rehabilitation in the M-group than the H-group, we strongly recommend using our mobile application as a better alternative than handouts for exercises and information for patients with knee OA.",
