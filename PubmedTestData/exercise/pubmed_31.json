        "Frailty is a state of reduced functional capacities in older people that can be reversed through multimodal therapy concepts. The effect of preoperative prehabilitation on frailty has been examined, but the heterogeneity of exercise regimens has prevented conclusive evidence. This scoping review analyses prehabilitation interventions, particularly exercise methods, published in trials for prefrail and frail elderly patients.",
        "We identified studies evaluating prehabilitation for frail elderly using the framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Five scientific databases were searched until March 2022. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Data extraction included, but was not limited to, study design, intervention protocol of the prehabilitation including exercise therapy and additional interventions, and safety of the reported exercise concepts.",
        "Nineteen studies were included, offering an insight into the utilized prehabilitation concepts for exercise. All study interventions were based around exercise programs, potentially with complementary interventions. Twelve studies based their exercise programs on a combination of endurance and strength training. Breathing exercises were prescribed in five studies, flexibility routines in five, and one study included balance training. Further interventions included nutritional counselling/supplementation in nine studies, smoking/alcohol cessation in five, in addition to two physiological and three medical/pharmaceutical interventions.",
        "Prehabilitation for the frail elderly is safe and feasible. The general concept of prehabiliation for frail patients is promising. An exercise program should focus on improving the patient's endurance and strength, considering the positive effects that can be provided by breathing exercises and other additional interventions, such as nutritional support or lifestyle counselling."
