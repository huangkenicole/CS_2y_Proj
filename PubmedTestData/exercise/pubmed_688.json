        "Secreted by white adipose tissue, asprosin is a newly recognized adipokine whose physiological function is not well comprehended. This study intended to determine the effect of spinning and stationary cycling on serum asprosin levels in overweight women.",
        "Forty-five overweight women with BMI>25\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the age range of 30-40\u00a0years were assigned randomly to\u00a0three groups of 15 participants: control, spinning (group\u00a0cycling with music), and stationary bike (individual pedaling on a stationary bike). The participants performed the exercises three sessions per week for six weeks. Lipid profile and asprosin levels were measured by enzymatic and ELISA methods, respectively. Moreover, the paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were employed to make within-group and between-group comparisons, respectively.",
        "The stationary cycling and spinning exercise groups experienced significant reductions in weight, BMI, serum triglyceride, and asprosin levels from the pretest to the posttest. The control group showed no statistically significant differences. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein only declined in the spinning group. In this regard, neither the control group nor the stationary bicycle exhibited no significant change over time. The spinning group demonstrated a significant rise in high-density lipoprotein levels, which was not observed in the control group. In addition, there was no significant difference in WHR index between the intervention groups.",
        "By lowering the serum asprosin level, a spinning exercise program appears to be effective in reducing disorders linked to metabolic diseases in overweight women."
