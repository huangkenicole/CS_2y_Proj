        "This systematic review aims to identify the effects of exercise interventions in patients with breast cancer (BCP) and survivors (BCS) on selected variables of physical fitness.",
        "A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Medline and Scopus. Randomized controlled trials with isolated exercise interventions in BCP and BCS women (<\u20095\u00a0years from therapy completion) were included. The risk of bias (RoB) assessment was conducted using the Cochrane RoB-2-tool. Variables regarding cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), strength (ST), fatigue (F) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were discussed.",
        "Of the 336 studies initially identified, 22 met all the inclusion criteria and were deemed eligible. RoB assessment indicated that the studies had predominantly \"some concerns\" or had \"low RoB\", with only 3 studies presenting a \"high RoB\". The mean duration and frequency of exercise interventions were 19\u00a0weeks and 3 sessions/week, performed at moderate intensity (65% VO<sub>2</sub>max and 66% 1RM, for aerobic and resistance-training interventions, respectively).",
        "Exercise interventions seem to be a valuable strategy in BCP to avoid the decline of CRF, ST, F and HRQoL. Conversely, improved physical function among BCS is observed for the same variables. Resistance training and combined interventions seem to provide the most encouraging variations of the selected outcomes.",
