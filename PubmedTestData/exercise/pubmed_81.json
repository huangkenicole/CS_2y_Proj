        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Exercise protocols are promising interventions to improve PD symptoms, however, the best modality and its neural correlates are still unknown.",
        "To evaluate the effects of the aerobic, strength and task-oriented upper-limb exercises in motor function, manual dexterity, and brain oscillations of individuals with PD.",
        "In this clinical trial, 44 PD patients aged 40-80\u00a0years will be randomized in four groups: aerobic training (AT), strength training (ST), task-oriented training (TOT), and waiting list group (CG). The AT group will perform 30\u00a0min of a cycle ergometer on 50%-70% of the reserve heart rate. The ST group will use equipment for upper limb muscles and will perform two series of 8-12 repetitions for each exercise, and intensity between 50% and 70% of one maximum repetition will be used. The TOT group will perform a program consisting of three activities to enhance reaching, grasping, and manipulation. All the groups will perform three sessions per week for 8\u00a0weeks. We will use the UPDRS Motor function section, Nine-Hole Peg Test, and quantitative electroencephalography to measure motor function, manual dexterity, and brain oscillations, respectively. ANOVA and regression models will be used to compare outcomes within and between groups."
