        "Changes in the ventilation demand nursing interventions duly adapted to the management of said impairment and to the adaptability of the child/parents. This revision aimed to investigate the evidence behind the interventions performed on children with impaired ventilation.'",
        "Systematic reviews of literature in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese from studies on nursing interventions related to children with impaired ventilation in all contexts of the clinical practice. The Joanna Briggs Institute recommendations were followed.",
        "We conducted a comprehensive search as of January 2022 and updated as of June 2023. The following electronic databases were searched: SCOPUS, Web of Science, Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCO), MedicLatina (via EBSCO), The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (via EBSCO), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Nineteen articles published between 2012 and 2022 were included in this review.",
        "Nineteen studies investigated the efficacy of respiratory exercises (Breathing Control - relaxed breathing, pursed lip breathing, Diaphragmatic breathing exercises, respiratory expansion exercise - deep breathing exercise, thoracic expansion exercises (with device), exercises for respiratory muscle strengthening and position to optimize ventilation. In the majority of the studies, it was not possible to evaluate the interventions separately. Thirteen studies evidenced the efficacy of respiratory exercises, BIPAP, and oxygen therapy. Seven articles demonstrated the effectiveness of respiratory muscle-strengthening exercises, and only three mentioned the efficacy of positioning regarding impaired ventilation. Interventions based on respiratory exercises and respiratory muscle training were the most common ones.",
        "The results suggest that nursing interventions to optimize ventilation are efficient. Nevertheless, the same present a low to moderate evidence degree, justified by the population characteristics (small and heterogeneous).",
        "There is proof of evidence for the studied interventions. However, the lack of methodological robustness points to future research to duly describe interventions, data, and comparable results, using reliable samples in which the focus of the study is clear."
