        "This case report describes the examination, intervention, and outcome of a 3-month episode of physical therapy (PT) using combined functional training and progressive resistance exercise for an adolescent with cerebral palsy.",
        "The patient presented with a long history of PT intervention and strength impairments that limited functional and transitional movement, agility, and peer-level participation in school and the community. Functional strength, aerobic conditioning, and anaerobic power were examined and addressed during intervention.",
        "Lower extremity strength was improved. Improvements in functional strength, agility, and anaerobic power generation were clinically insignificant. Most importantly, patient defined participation improved and was accompanied by achievement of new transitional and functional movements.",
        "Outcomes described support the use of progressive resistance exercise and functional training to improve strength and functional mobility in an adolescent with cerebral palsy."
