        "Pain intensity, functional performance, psychological symptoms, and quality of life were assessed pre-exercise and immediately after the first, fourth, and eighth weeks of intervention.",
        "Pain intensity, functional performance, psychological symptoms, and quality of life increased significantly in both groups (P<.05); however, no significant differences between groups were found in all outcomes (P>.05).",
        "tDCS associated with functional exercises did not enhance the effects of physical exercise on pain, functional performance, psychological symptoms, and quality of life of patients with FM."
