        "Active video games can make physical activity more appealing and enjoyable for older people. This study compared the effects of 30\u00a0min of Exergaming versus walking on the physiological and psychological measures of asymptomatic older adults.",
        "Forty eligible participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a069.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.16\u00a0y/o) were randomly divided into two groups of 20 in a crossover design, who either performed Brisk Walking or Exergaming, one week apart. Before each session, each participant's blood pressure was measured, and the subjects were encouraged to play/walk continuously for 30\u00a0min using a self-selected intensity. During both sessions, average and peak heart rate, time spent in each of the heart rate zones, blood pressure, and double product were assessed through a Polar H10 heart rate monitor. Participants also filled out the modified Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) questionnaire and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale.",
        "Findings indicated a significantly higher average (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and peak heart rate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and double product (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) during Exergaming compared to Brisk Walking. Also, the RPE score was significantly lower and PACES score was significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) during the Exergaming session. The analyses of blood pressure showed significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures following each session, while no statistically significant difference was reported between the two exercise modalities (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively).",
        "This study showed that Exergaming can be a good alternative to traditional exercises like walking for older adults, providing physiological benefits while being less exhausting and more enjoyable."
