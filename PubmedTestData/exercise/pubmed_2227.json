        "Hypertension is one of the most common causes for cardiovascular mortality in China and physical exercises have been well recognized for its prevention and treatment. Recent studies indicated that the methods of exercise differed in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, endothelial function, etc.",
        "In the present study, we compared the effects of high-intensity intermittent exercise and moderate-intensity continuous exercise on the blood pressure, plasma CRAMP level and living quality of hypertensive patients. We measured the basic characteristics of all the individuals and made intermittent/continuous exercise plans according to each of their conditions.",
        "The whole training lasted for 16 weeks and the CRAMP level of each patient was recorded by blood sampling and ELISA test. The patients' quality of life (QoL) was also surveyed to determine their physical and psychological health. Our result suggested that the intermittent exercise significantly reduced the blood pressure and the CRAMP level of the hypertensive patients. Although the physical pain and social function were not improved by either exercises training, the other six dimensions of QoL, including physical function, physical role, general health condition, vitality, emotional role and mental health, were significant improved by exercises, especially by intermittent exercises.",
        "To sum up, the high-intensity intermittent exercise and moderate-intensity continuous exercise could both improve the living quality of hypertensive patients, but the effect of intermittent exercise was more obvious that it reduced the blood pressure and the CRAMP level of hypertensive patients and improve the living quality in a higher level."
