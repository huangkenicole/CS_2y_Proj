        "Core stability exercises and treadmill training play a crucial role in physical therapy interventions and have an effect on balance in children with Down Syndrome (DS); however, whether core stability exercises or treadmill training has more effect on improving balance has not been investigated yet. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of core stability training versus treadmill exercises on balance in children with Down Syndrome.",
        "Forty-five children aged 4-6\u00a0years with Down Syndrome were included in the study. The children were equally divided randomly into three groups. Group A received traditional physical therapy intervention strategies to facilitate the balance of participating children. Group B received the same as group A and additional core stability exercise training. Group C received the same intervention strategies as group A in conjunction with a treadmill exercise program. The children's balance was evaluated using the Berg balance scale and the Biodex Balance System. Treatment sessions were for 60\u00a0min, thrice a week, for 8 consecutive weeks.",
        "There were significance improvements in the three groups in functional balance and over all stability indices in favor of groups B and C.",
        "Core stability and treadmill training improved balance in children with Down Syndrome and should be applied in conjunction with physical therapy programs."
