        "Seniors, during their senescence, experience difficulties when engaging in physical, social, and leisure activities. Meanwhile, increased access to information technology in recent years among seniors has led to the increased applicability of games aiding senior activities that incorporate information technology. In this study, we constructed and assessed a nursing intervention incorporating an actual walking exercise game developed for the use of seniors in order to identify the cognitive, social, and physical impact it has on their health behaviors.",
        "This quasi-experimental study used a one-group pre-/post-test design in which 15 people 65 years of age or older were selected to participate through a serious health game conducted at the senior welfare center twice a week, for 12 weeks. Besides having their basic physical measurements taken, seniors participated in physical exercise sessions that included educational content. The measured variables were health beliefs and concerns, subjective knowledge, subjective norms, perceived reliability, perceived ease of use and usefulness, perceived behavioral control, attitudes about health behaviors, intentions to perform health behaviors, health behaviors, blood pressure, pulse rate, endurance, agility and balance, and flexibility.",
        "Significant increases in health beliefs and concerns, perceived reliability, perceived behavioral control, perceived ease of use, attitudes about health behaviors, and intentions to perform health behaviors were observed at post-test, compared with pre-test data points. These increases were also recorded for physical domains. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse rates were noted immediately after the intervention, along with increased endurance levels, indicating that the exercise had an effect on participants' health.",
        "Ongoing research is required regarding the development and impact of distinctive nursing interventions, conducted through various forms of serious health games relatively easy to use, by integrating various motivating factors for engaging in health behaviors and the entertainment value of such games."
