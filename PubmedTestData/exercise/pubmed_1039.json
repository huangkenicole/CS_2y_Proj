        "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and frailty syndrome are major problems for successful aging. These conditions share many biological aspects, symptoms and adverse effects. Aerobic capacity and muscle strength, that are important characteristics for independence in daily activity, are markedly reduced in older adults with CVD and frailty. There are evidence and recommendations of physical activity and exercises to prevent, treat and manage these conditions. However, the exact dose-response (type, intensity and duration) of exercises is still uncertain for these population. A good physical exercise program should consider the aging physiologic alterations, the vulnerability of the frail syndrome, and the functional-structural changes of CVD. Therefore, a multicomponent program with aerobic and strength training is desirable to improve these conditions. For long term results it is important to older adults with these conditions to change lifestyle and be more active during daily living to reduce sedentary behavior. Being frail with CVD it is not a contraindication for older adults to be engaged in physical activities."
