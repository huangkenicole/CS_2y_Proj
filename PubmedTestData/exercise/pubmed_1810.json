        "Cancer mostly affects older adults, causing a wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. One of the most important moments in cancer patients is the hospitalization period, in which older patients usually remain bedridden for many hours and this may lead to the appearance of sarcopenia and disability.",
        "We present the research protocol for a randomized controlled trial that will analyze whether an intervention applied to older patients (\u2265 65 years) who are hospitalized for acute medical conditions in an Oncology Department improves function. A total of 240 hospitalized older patients will be recruited in the Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, and they will be randomized. The intervention consists of a multicomponent exercise training program that will take place for 4 consecutive days (2 sessions/day). The control group will receive usual hospital care, which will include physical rehabilitation when needed. The primary end point will be the change in functional capacity from baseline to hospital discharge, assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary end points will be changes in cognitive and mood status, quality of life, fatigue, strength (dynamic and handgrip), pain, nutrition, length of stay, falls, readmission rate and mortality at 3 months after discharge.",
        "Basal data of the patients included in the RCT are described. The foreseen recruitment will not be achieved due to the context of the Covid pandemic and the significantly different responses observed during the clinical trial in oncogeriatric patients compared to our previous experience in older adults hospitalized for medical reasons.",
        "If our hypothesis is correct and shows that a multicomponent, individualized and progressive exercise program is an effective therapy for improving the capacity of acutely hospitalized older patients compared to usual care, a change in the current system of hospitalization may be justified in oncogeriatric patients."
