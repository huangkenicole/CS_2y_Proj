        "This systematic review aimed to present the comparison of the impacts of conventional exercise and virtual reality (VR) exergaming on the physical and cognitive abilities of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The literature search was conducted in the EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies were identified by independent reviewers based on the title, abstract and full-texts. Studies were limited to randomized clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals in English that compared conventional exercise with VR-exergaming for improving the physical and cognitive abilities of PwMS. Selected studies were assessed for their risk of bias and the major findings of the reviewed studies were analyzed descriptively. The search identified 239 articles of which 10 studies met the eligibility criteria. Despite these studies employing strategies to control biases, some risks of bias remain. Various gaming platforms and conventional exercises were used based on the extent of technologies and therapy regimens. The selected studies used measures of physical and cognitive abilities to compare VR-exergaming with conventional exercise. This review suggests positive impacts of both VR-exergaming and conventional exercise in MS rehabilitation. We also found that VR-exergaming generally exceeded conventional exercise for improving physical and cognitive abilities, psychosocial status, and fatigue."
