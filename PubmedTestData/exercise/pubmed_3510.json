        "The incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is expected to increase as our population ages and will likely strain the projected capacity of our health care system. Despite being the most common movement disorder, there have been few noninvasive therapeutic advances for people with PD since the first levodopa clinical trial in 1961. The study of PD pathogenesis, combined with an appreciation for the biochemical mechanisms by which physical activity and exercise may impact physiology, has resulted in emerging hypotheses for new modifiable risk factors for PD. Physical activity and exercise as a means of preventing PD, or maintaining the functionality of people with PD, are a promising area of investigation. Conversely, physical inactivity is implicated in many disease states, some of which are also correlated with the development of PD, such as metabolic syndrome. The primary relationship between these diseases is likely rooted in heightened inflammation and oxidative stress at the cellular level. Physical activity and exercise as a means of attenuating inflammation have led to increased interest in related potential therapeutic targets for PD. Ultimately, these findings may translate into low-cost, universally available therapies for PD disease modification or prevention. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."
