        "Rehabilitation protocols involving eccentric resistance exercise performed with loading more than 100% concentric 1-repetition maximum are effective in increasing muscle function in both healthy and injured populations. The mode of eccentric exercise (isokinetic versus isotonic) may be an important factor in limiting symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness and in improving muscle function after training.",
        "To compare functional and symptomatic responses after an eccentric-only (ECC) isotonic exercise protocol and after a combined concentric-eccentric (CON-ECC) isokinetic exercise protocol matched for total exercise volume.",
        "Observational study.",
        "Controlled research laboratory.",
        "Twenty-four healthy, untrained, college-aged men (n = 12) and women (n = 12).",
        "Participants were randomly assigned to the ECC isotonic or CON-ECC isokinetic exercise group and performed a single bout of resistance exercise involving the elbow flexors.",
        "Measurements of elbow flexion and extension, isometric strength, and muscle point tenderness were obtained before exercise (baseline) and during follow-up sessions (days 2, 4, 7, and 14). Separate 1-way analyses of variance and repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to determine outcome differences. Tukey post hoc testing was performed when indicated.",
        "At baseline, no differences were present between groups for any measure. The ECC isotonic exercise protocol resulted in a 30% to 36% deficit in muscle strength, a 5% to 7% reduction in elbow flexion, and a 6% to 8% reduction in elbow extension at follow-up days 2 and 4 (P < .01). The CON-ECC isokinetic exercise protocol did not alter muscle strength or range of motion at any time when compared with baseline. Muscle point tenderness increased from baseline on days 2 and 4 in both groups (P < .05) but was not different between groups throughout the recovery period.",
        "Our results indicated more pronounced functional deficits occurred after a single bout of ECC isotonic exercise than with a CON-ECC isokinetic exercise protocol matched for training volume."
