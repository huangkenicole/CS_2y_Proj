        "Although exercise guidelines now recommend exercise for patients with MCI, the long-term effects of exercise in patients with MCI has not been reviewed systematically. The aim was to assess (1) the effectiveness of exercise and physical activity (EXPA) interventions in improving long-term patient-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in people with mild cognitive impairment, (2) how well the included trials reported details of the intervention, and (3) the extent to which reported endpoints were in line with patient preferences that were assessed in patient workshops. Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials. A total of ten studies were included after searching in six electronic sources from 1995 onwards. There is a trend that 6\u2009+\u2009-month EXPA interventions improve global cognition 12\u00a0months after initiation. Evidence on long-term effects of EXPA interventions on non-cognitive health outcomes could not be meaningfully pooled and the individual studies reported mixed results. Workshop participants considered freedom from pain and stress, mood, motivation and self-efficacy to be important, but these outcomes were rarely addressed. Too little information is available on intervention details for EXPA programs to be replicated and confidently recommended for patients with MCI.
