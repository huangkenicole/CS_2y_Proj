      "AbstractText": [
        "Acute and protracted effects of resistive exercise (RE) and resistive exercise with whole-body vibration (RVE) on metabolic markers of bone metabolism were investigated. Twenty-six men participated in a randomized training program including RE (<i>n</i> = 13; age = 23.4 \u00b1 1.4 years) or RVE (<i>n</i> = 13; age = 24.3 \u00b1 3.3 years). During the first session, acute C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) responses decreased by 12.9% (standard deviation, SD 13.7%) after 2 min, followed by a 15.5% (SD 36.0%) increase at 75 min after exercise (both <i>p</i> < 0.001). Procollagen type I amino terminal propeptide (P1NP) increased by 12.9% (SD 9.1%) at 2 min (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but no change occurred at 75 min. Sclerostin showed prolonged responses from 2 to 75 min post-exercise in the first session (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Acute responses at the first session were comparable between groups for CTX and P1NP, acute sclerostin responses were substantially greater in RE than in RVE (<i>p</i> = 0.003). No significant differences were noted in the resting baseline levels of CTX, P1NP, or sclerostin from the beginning to the end of the six-week progressive training. The present study therefore did not demonstrate any sizeable enhancement of bone turnover that could match the effects that have been repeatably made in response to countermeasure exercise during bed rest."
