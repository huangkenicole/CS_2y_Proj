        "People with physical disabilities need exercise routines that are enjoyable, readily available in the home, adapted to their functional level, and eliminate common barriers to exercise participation related to transportation and time commitment. The purpose of the movement-to-music (M2M) study is to address these issues by establishing a remotely delivered, rhythmic exercise program for people with physical disabilities.",
        "The study is a two-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial examining a 12-week remotely delivered M2M intervention (eM2M) in 108 people with physical disabilities. The primary outcomes are changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength at post 12-week intervention.",
        "The eM2M study will enhance our understanding of an alternative intervention design and delivery mode that removes common barriers to exercise participation experienced by people with physical disabilities. The eM2M intervention may be an alternative option for people with physical disabilities to obtain regular exercise, especially during a pandemic when exercising in indoor facilities may be problematic.",
