        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of core stability-based corrective exercises, on gait parameters in elite soccer players diagnosed with middle crossed syndrome.",
        "15 male elite soccer players (aged 18-28) were enrolled in a same-subject intervention trial to assess if the middle crossed syndrome could be influenced through core stability exercise. Core stability-based corrective exercises were completed 3 times per week for 8 weeks and changes in gait parameters (pre- and post- intervention) were measured.",
        "The results showed that most gait parameters including stride length (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), gait speed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), number of strides (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), length of shots (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and also soccer players' height (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) improved significantly in post-intervention in comparison to pre-intervention. Stride width in post-intervention did not show changes in comparison with pre-intervention (p\u00a0=\u00a00.083).",
        "The results indicate the significant effectiveness of core stability-based corrective exercises on gait parameters in those with middle crossed syndrome. By doing corrective exercises based on core stability during the study period, gait parameters in the post-intervention surpass the results in the pre-intervention in most parameters. Therefore, it is proposed that corrective exercises based on core stability is a safe and useful method for improving function in those with middle crossed syndrome and it could be used as a therapy to help players identified with this finding. In this regard, it is suggested to researchers and coaches to correct imbalances in order to achieve better results in training programs."
