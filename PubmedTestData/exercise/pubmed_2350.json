        "Older adults are at risk of multiple chronic diseases, most of which could be prevented by engaging in regular physical activity. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to diseases. Worsening symptoms of frailty, such as decrease in physical functionality, can compromise health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Previous findings suggest that frailty moderates the relationship between physical activity and HR-QOL, yet intervention findings are limited, particularly in dose-response analyses. Hence, this study was conducted to test if lower-dose physical activity (120 minutes/week) would provide the same benefits in health outcomes (physical functionality and HR-QOL) as higher-dose physical activity (180 minutes/week).",
        "Participants (n=110) were older adults comprising higher-dose, lower-dose, and control groups who were combined from recent randomized controlled trials. Experimental groups participated in a multimodal exercise program in a supervised laboratory setting for 12 weeks.",
        "The higher-dose group showed a significant improvement in physical functionality (<i>\u03b2</i>=0.23, <i>P</i>=0.03) and in overall HR-QOL (<i>\u03b2</i>=0.44, <i>P</i>=0.001) including its subcategories over the control group. A group \u00d7 frailty interaction revealed that frail individuals significantly improved in capacity HR-QOL when they exercised at a higher dose (<i>F</i> (1, 49)=4.57, <i>P</i>=0.038).",
        "This study identifies a positive, predictive relationship between exercise duration and health outcomes (HR-QOL dimensions and frailty) among older adults. Frail individuals in the higher-dose group demonstrated significant recovery of capacity HR-QOL, thus reflecting improvement in their daily activities."
