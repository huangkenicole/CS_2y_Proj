        "<b>Aim:</b>\u00a0To compare effects of clinical Pilates and home exercises on postural disorders, strength and endurance of deep cervical flexors (DCF), cervical range of motion (CROM), pain intensity and functional disability in sagittal cervical disorientation. <b>Patients & methods</b>: Fourty six\u00a0patients were included and divided into\u00a0two groups. Clinical Pilates group performed stabilization based exercise and home exercise group performed conventional exercises. <b>Results:</b> Craniovertebral, head tilt, cervicothoracic angles and\u00a0strength and endurance of DCF\u00a0muscles\u00a0had improvement in favor of clinical Pilates group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was no difference between groups in terms of right-left acromial distance, pain intensity, functional disability and CROM parameters (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical Pilates exercises have been found to provide clinically significant improvements in craniovertebral, head tilt, cervicothoracic angles and strength and endurance of DCF muscles. However, in the increase of CROM, decreasing pain severity and functional impairment parameters there was no superiority of both exercise training. <b>Clinical trial registration number:</b> NCT03352921\u00a0(Clinicaltrials.gov)."
