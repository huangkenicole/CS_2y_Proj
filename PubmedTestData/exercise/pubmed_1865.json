        "Guidelines for peripheral vascular disease state that supervised exercise therapy (SET) programmes improve walking distance and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication. This paper outlines the steps needed to implement a successful SET programme and discusses some of the challenges.",
        "Edinburgh Leisure was approached to coordinate an exercise programme aimed at rehabilitation, run by level 4 members of the Register of Exercise Professionals. It is estimated to be cost effective at 500 referrals compared with physiotherapy referral. Success is measured by walking distance, reduction of symptoms and weight loss. Edinburgh Leisure also measures success with feedback and membership numbers at its health centres.",
        "Between 4 March 2014 and 25 January 2016, 155 patients were referred to the SET programme with a median age of 68 years (range: 39-95 years) and a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. Of these, 117 patients attended and 29 have completed the programme. The mean walking distance increased from 298.5m (range: 150-385m) to 360m (range: 195-482m), an improvement of 20%. Increasing class numbers and venues, and introducing evening classes to make the programme accessible to more patients has addressed initial patient engagement issues.",
        "Collaboration with motivated local authorities can help implement a successful healthcare intervention. Early analysis is necessary to improve the system and engage as many patients as possible. The SET programme discussed has shown similar results to those of previous studies but is available at no personal cost to regional patients with intermittent claudication."
