        "Perceptions that women are in greater need of fall prevention might impact their participation in programs. This study aimed to understand gender differences in motivating factors and experiences in a fall prevention program. Thirty-four adults (18 men and 16 women) aged 60 years or older participated in focus groups after 12 weeks of fall prevention exercises and education. Six main themes emerged. <i>It might be a macho thing</i> represented an overarching theme of why men might not participate in fall prevention as readily as women. <i>Personal experience as a motivator</i>, <i>Get my balance back</i>, and <i>Challenges/Successes</i> were common themes for men and women. Both genders realized the benefits of the program; however, men emphasized the importance of personal outcomes (<i>Being part of something bigger</i>), whereas women highlighted group outcomes (<i>Socialization</i>). These findings can guide the future messaging and marketing of fall prevention programs for older adults."
