        "Jump performance is considered an important factor in many sports. Thus, strategies such as weightlifting (WL) exercises, traditional resistance training (TRT) and plyometric training (PT) are effective at improving jump performance. However, it is not entirely clear which of these strategies can enable greater improvements on jump height. Thus, the purpose of the meta-analysis was to compare the improvements on countermovement jump (CMJ) performance between training methods which focus on WL exercises, TRT, and PT. Seven studies were included, of which one study performed both comparison. Therefore, four studies comparing WL exercises vs. TRT (total n\u00a0=\u00a078) and four studies comparing WL exercises vs. PT (total n\u00a0=\u00a076). The results showed greater improvements on CMJ performance for WL exercises compared to TRT (ES<sub>diff</sub>: 0.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23; <sub>95%</sub>CI: 0.26, 1.19; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002; \u0394 %\u00a0=\u00a07.5 and 2.1, respectively). The comparison between WL exercises vs. PT revealed no significant difference between protocols (ES<sub>diff</sub>: 0.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23; <sub>95%</sub>CI: -0.30, 0.60; P\u00a0=\u00a00.518; \u0394 %\u00a0=\u00a08.8 and 8.1, respectively). In conclusion, WL exercises are superior to promote positive changes on CMJ performance compared to TRT; however, WL exercises and PT are equally effective at improving CMJ performance."
