        "We aimed to examine the effects of Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) approach in older patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP).",
        "A total of 72 participants with CNSLBP were assigned to either the experimental group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200936) or control group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200936) in this randomized study. A conventional physiotherapy program was administered to the participants in the control group for 3\u2009days per week for a total of 6\u2009weeks. In addition to the conventional program, DNS exercise protocol was performed for 3\u2009days per week for 6\u2009weeks for the participants in the experimental group. While quality of movements and exercise capacity were our primary outcomes, functional balance and quality of life constituted our secondary outcomes. The participants were assessed both at baseline and post-treatment.",
        "The improvement in a deep squat, in-line lunge, hurdle step, shoulder flexibility, rotary trunk stability, total Functional Movement Screening score, and Timed-up and Go Test score was greater in the experimental group (<i>p</i><.05). The improvement was similar in both groups in terms of the rest of outcome measures.",
        "This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the DNS approach on some functional movement patterns and functional balance performance in older patients with CNSLBP."
