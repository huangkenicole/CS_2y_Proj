        "Game-based training has been shown to improve behavioural motor learning in various medical fields including rehabilitation.",
        "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a tablet PC (personal computer) game-based tongue training on tongue strength, thickness and compliance in healthy adults.",
        "This study recruited 30 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (n\u00a0=\u00a015/group). Group 1 performed game-based tongue training, and group 2 performed tongue resistance training using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument. Both groups performed the same tongue exercises as follows: frequency (isotonic\u00a0=\u00a030 times\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03, isometric\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0seconds\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03), intensity (70% of 1-repeated maximum contraction) and intervention period (5\u00a0days for 6\u00a0weeks). The primary outcomes were tongue muscle strength and thickness. Secondary outcomes were assessed using a 0-to-10 numerical rating self-report scale that included motivation, interest/fun, physical effort and muscle fatigue/pain.",
        "Both groups showed significant improvement in tongue strength and thickness, but there were no significant differences between the groups after the intervention. The self-report scale numerical rating revealed that group 1 had significantly higher motivation and interest/fun after the exercise than group 2. Group 1 had expended a significantly lower physical effort than group 2. No significant differences were noted between the 2 groups for muscle fatigue/pain.",
        "This study showed that both exercises had similar effects on tongue strength and thickness increase in healthy adults, but game-based tongue training was more fun and physically less demanding."
