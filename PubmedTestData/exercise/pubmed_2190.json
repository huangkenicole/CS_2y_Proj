        "Fall prevention exercise programmes are known to be effective, but access to these programmes is not always possible. The use of eHealth solutions might be a way forward to increase access and reach a wider population. In this feasibility study the aim was to explore the choice of programme, adherence, and self-reported experiences comparing two exercise programmes - a digital programme and a paper booklet.",
        "A participant preference trial of two self-managed fall prevention exercise interventions. Community-dwelling adults aged 70\u2009years and older exercised independently for four months after one introduction meeting. Baseline information was collected at study start, including a short introduction of the exercise programme, a short physical assessment, and completion of questionnaires. During the four months intervention period, participants self-reported their performed exercises in an exercise diary. At a final meeting, questionnaires about their experiences, and post-assessments, were completed. For adherence analyses data from diaries were used and four subgroups for different levels of participation were compared. Exercise maintenance was followed up with a survey 12\u2009months after study start.",
        "Sixty-seven participants, with mean age 77\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009years were included, 72% were women. Forty-three percent chose the digital programme. Attrition rate was 17% in the digital programme group and 37% in the paper booklet group (p\u00a0=\u2009.078). In both groups 50-59% reported exercise at least 75% of the intervention period. The only significant difference for adherence was in the subgroup that completed \u226575% of exercise duration, the digital programme users exercised more minutes per week (p\u00a0=\u2009.001). Participants in both groups were content with their programme but digital programme users reported a significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u2009.026) degree of being content, and feeling supported by the programme (p\u00a0=\u2009.044). At 12\u2009months follow-up 67% of participants using the digital programme continued to exercise regularly compared with 35% for the paper booklet (p\u00a0=\u2009.036).",
        "Exercise interventions based on either a digital programme or a paper booklet can be used as a self-managed, independent fall prevention programme. There is a similar adherence in both programmes during a 4-month intervention, but the digital programme seems to facilitate long-term maintenance in regular exercise.",
