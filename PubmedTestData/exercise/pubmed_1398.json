        "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to identify the integrated effects of exercise therapy on global cognitive function and, depression in older adults with mild cognitive function (MCI) and to determine the optimal exercise methods.",
        "We searched international, and domestic databases from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2022, and included 22 articles in the meta-analysis (global cognitive function 21 articles; depression 7articles). Meta-analysis of variance and meta-regression were performed with moderator analysis to explore the causes of heterogeneity RESULTS: The mean effects (standardized mean differences) were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.91) for global cognitive function and -0.38 (95% CI: -0.63 to -0.12) for depression in older adults with MCI who received exercise therapy, and the effect was statistically significant.",
        "Aerobic and resistance exercises were effective in improving global cognitive function, Whereas multicomponent and neuromotor exercises were not. Aerobic exercise was the most effective at improving cognitive function. Thus, exercise therapy is effective in reducing depression in older adults with MCI. The mean effect of global cognitive function increased with higher exercise frequency."
