        "Quality of life has multiple aspects, but little is known about the effects of exercise on each domain of it. This systematic review aimed to determine the effects of aerobic, resistance, and mixed exercise on multiple aspects of quality of life in patients with cancer through a meta-analysis.",
        "Randomized controlled trials with quality of life were collected, and 20 studies were analyzed. Subgroup analyses were performed according to exercise types.",
        "Exercise improved global, physical, role, and emotional quality of life, but not cognitive and social quality of life. Aerobic, resistance, and mixed exercises improved global, physical, role, emotional, and social quality of life; global, physical and role quality of life; and only physical quality of life, respectively.",
        "According to exercise type, aerobic and resistance exercises improved global, physical, and role quality of life, whereas aerobic exercise only improved emotional quality of life."
