        "Stabilization exercise (SE) is evident for the management of chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP). The optimal dose-response-relationship for the utmost treatment success is, thus, still unknown. The purpose is to systematically review the dose-response-relationship of stabilisation exercises on pain and disability in patients with chronic non-specific LBP. A systematic review with meta-regression was conducted (Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane). Eligibility criteria were RCTs on patients with chronic non-specific LBP, written in English/German and adopting a longitudinal core-specific/stabilising/motor control exercise intervention with at least one outcome for pain intensity and/or disability. Meta-regressions (dependent variable\u2009=\u2009effect sizes (Cohens d) of the interventions (for pain and for disability), independent variable\u2009=\u2009training characteristics (duration, frequency, time per session)), and controlled for (low) study quality (PEDro) and (low) sample sizes (n) were conducted to reveal the optimal dose required for therapy success. From the 3,415 studies initially selected, 50 studies (n\u2009=\u20092,786 LBP patients) were included. N\u2009=\u20091,239 patients received SE. Training duration was 7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3\u00a0weeks, training frequency was 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 sessions per week with a mean training time of 44.6\u2009\u00b1\u200918.0\u00a0min per session. The meta-regressions' mean effect size was d\u2009=\u20091.80 (pain) and d\u2009=\u20091.70 (disability). Total R<sup>2</sup> was 0.445 and 0.17. Moderate quality evidence (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.231) revealed that a training duration of 20 to 30\u00a0min elicited the largest effect (both in pain and disability, logarithmic association). Low quality evidence (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.125) revealed that training 3 to 5 times per week led to the largest effect of SE in patients with chronic non-specific LBP (inverted U-shaped association). In patients with non-specific chronic LBP, stabilization exercise with a training frequency of 3 to 5 times per week (Grade C) and a training time of 20 to 30\u00a0min per session (Grade A) elicited the largest effect on pain and disability."
