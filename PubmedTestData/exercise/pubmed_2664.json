        "Irisin has been suggested as a helpful hormone for adverse metabolic conditions. However, the interaction between acute endurance exercises and irisin is still unclear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the acute effect of endurance training, either continuous or interval training, on circulating irisin in healthy adults.",
        "Literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL until September 2022. Clinical trials measuring irisin levels following a single session of interval or continuous endurance training in healthy adults were eligible. Cohen's d effect size (95% confidence level), subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression were calculated using a random-effects model. The procedures described by PRISMA were followed and the protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42021240971).",
        "Data of the 16 included studies comprising 412 individuals showed a significant increase following one session of continuous endurance training (d = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.46<i>, p <</i> 0.001), while interval training did not change circulating irisin (d = 0.16, 95% CI: -0.12 to 0.44<i>, p</i> = 0.202). Both subgroup and univariate meta-regression analyses showed non-significant differences in the change of circulating irisin comparing blood measurement, exercise mode or previous level of physical activity of the participants and circulating irisin at baseline, duration, or intensity of the exercise, respectively.",
        "Continuous method for endurance training increases circulating irisin in healthy adults, while studies measuring circulating irisin following interval training in healthy adults are still limited to be conclusive."
