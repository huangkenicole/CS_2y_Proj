        "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Lack of diagnostic awareness of lipedema and frequent confusion with obesity or lymphedema may be an obstacle for treatment. The clinical effects of conservative treatment methods are not clearly known. This study investigated the effects of exercise-based rehabilitation combined with complete decongestive therapy (CDT) or intermittent pneumatic compression therapy (IPCT) or alone in patients with severe lipedema. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Thirty-three women with severe (type 3, stage III or IV) lipedema diagnosed according to the revised-Wold criteria were randomized into three groups: Group 1 (CDT plus exercises), Group 2 (IPCT plus exercises), and Group 3 (control-exercises alone). All groups received 30 sessions of combined (aerobic, strengthening, and stretching) exercise program. In addition, there were CDT in Group 1 and IPCT in Group 2 five times a week for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the limb volume measurements. The secondary outcome measures were anthropometric measurements (body weight, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, waist-to-hip ratio), 6-minute walk test, visual analog scale for pain, fatigue severity scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Thirty-one participants completed the interventions. Limb volumes (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.017, \u03b7p<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.562 for right; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001, \u03b7p<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.775 for left), pain (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.045, \u03b7p<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.199), and physical functioning subscore of SF-36 (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.040, \u03b7p<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.465) differed significantly between treatments originating from Group 1. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> All programs improved outcome measurements after the intervention. However, when the difference between treatments was investigated, CDT administered in addition to the exercises has been shown to provide significant improvements in reducing limb volumes, pain, and physical function. <b>Clinical trial registration number:</b> The study was registered at the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) (NCT03924999) and available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03924999?term=lipedema&draw=2&rank=6."
