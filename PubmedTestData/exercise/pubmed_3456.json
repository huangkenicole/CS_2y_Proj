        "The world's population is ageing. Age-related declines in physical function negatively affect the quality of life but may be ameliorated by certain types of exercise. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of combining resistance training (RT) with balance training on physical function in older community-dwelling adults to provide a reference for this type of exercise compared with other exercises and to provide a theoretical basis for optimising exercise plans to improve physical function among older adults.",
        "This single-blind randomised controlled trial will recruit 66 community dwelling adults 60-89 years of age with normal cognition. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: RT, RT combined with balance training or a control group with usual daily activities. Exercise interventions will be conducted in three 45\u2009min sessions per week for 24 weeks. Primary physical function outcomes will be assessed using the timed up and go test, usual walking speed, maximal walking speed, 30\u2009s chair stand and 30\u2009s arm curl. Secondary assessments will be conducted using the 2\u2009min step test, back scratch test and chair sit-and-reach test. All physical function assessments will be performed at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of exercise interventions. Exercise intensity will be monitored to maintain moderate intensity by heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion and OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale. Data that conform to a normal distribution will be expressed as means\u00b1SD, otherwise as medians and interquartile intervals. Pretest, mid-test and post-test outcomes will be analysed for within-group and between-group comparisons using two-way repeated measures analyses of variance.",
        "This proposal was reviewed and approved by the Shanghai University of Sport Research Ethics Committee (102772021RT067). The results will be disseminated to the trial participants and as a peer-reviewed publication.",
