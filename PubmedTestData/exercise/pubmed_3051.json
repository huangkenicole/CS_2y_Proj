        "Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease that results in interstitial edema in the limbs, and to a lesser extent in the genitals and face, due to damage to the lymphatic system.",
        "Research was conducted between July 2022 and September 2022 in biomedical databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), and PEDro.",
        "Two studies showed that lymphedema alters gait parameters by affecting mainly kinematic parameters, although kinetic parameters were found to be significantly altered, especially in patients with severe lymphedema. In other studies, using methods such as videos and questionnaires, difficulties in walking were found in the presence of lymphedema. The most common abnormality was antalgic gait.",
        "Poor mobility can worsen the edema, which, in turn, can compromise joint range of motion. Gait analysis is an essential tool to evaluate and follow."
