        "Although there is a growing body of literature showing promising effects of balance training on gait in older adults, little is known about the effects of dual-task training on varying domains of spatial and temporal gait parameters.",
        "Does the short-term effects of dual-task balance training differ between single and dual-task gait in older women with osteoporosis with regards to different gait domains (pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry and postural control)?",
        "Elderly women with osteoporosis who experienced fear of falling and/or \u22651 fall the last 12 months were recruited. Ninety-five participants were randomized to 12 weeks of balance training or to a control group. The participants in the training group (n\u2009=\u200965) received 12 weeks (3 times/week) of balance and gait exercises including dual-tasks, and the control group (n\u2009=\u200930) received care as usual. Single- and dual-task gait were assessed before and after the intervention with an electronic walkway system and analyzed using non-parametric statistics and effect sizes.",
        "68 participants completed the study. The training group walked faster for single- and dual-task gait following training (P \u2264 .044) by increasing their cadence (P \u2264 .012) and reducing step and swing time (P \u2264 .045) compared with the control group. Significant between-group differences in favor of the training group were found for gait variability during dual-task gait (P \u2264 .041). The improvement in speed were greater for dual- than single-task gait (0.10 vs. 0.05\u2009m/s) and the effect sizes revealed small to medium effects for dual-task gait, and either non-existent or small for single-task gait.",
        "Greater training effects found on a variety of domains of dual-task gait compared to single-task gait support the role of cognitively demanding exercises for the maintenance of safe ambulation in older women with osteoporosis."
