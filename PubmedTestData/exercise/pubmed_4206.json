        "Regaining functional independence and independent living is challenging in hospitalized geriatric patients. Different from community dwelling and institutionalized older people, geriatric patients on rehabilitation wards generally receive more frequent and structured physiotherapy with the primary aim to discharge them to their home or place of residence. There is a paucity of evidence concerning the structure and components of physiotherapy programs to improve functional performance in this particular group. In this paper, we describe how we developed the Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg (GAPP) based on patients' needs and available literature.",
        "We searched the literature on physiotherapy interventions focusing on the core components for improvement of functional performance: strength, balance, function, (gait)speed, coordination, and endurance training. Based on physiotherapist staffing and physiotherapy time allocated to each patient, we organized the practical, daily delivery of the program.",
        "GAPP is a 5-day program, repeated weekly, delivered by physiotherapists and physiotherapy students. Each day, one or a combination of two to three different core components of functional performance is trained intensively in 45-min sessions. A set of standard exercises is constantly adjusted to each patients' capacity. On day 5, there is a mix of these core elements in a group session (e.g., chair-dance, table tennis, karate) and the Berg Balance Scale is completed to evaluate progress.",
