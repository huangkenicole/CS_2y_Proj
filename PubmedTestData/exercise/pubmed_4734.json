        "Decompensated heart failure patients are characterised by functional dependence and low exercise tolerance. Aerobic exercise can improve symptoms, functional capacity and an increase in exercise tolerance. However, the benefits of early rehabilitation have not yet been validated.",
        "To evaluate the safety and feasibility of an aerobic exercise training programme in functional capacity of decompensated heart failure patients.",
        "A single centre, parallel, randomised controlled, open label trial, with 100 patients. The training group (TG, <i>n</i>=50) performed the training protocol and the control group (CG, <i>n</i>=50) performed the usual rehabilitation procedures. The London chest activity of daily living (LCADL) scale, the Barthel index (BI) and the 6 minute walking test (6MWT) at discharge were used to evaluate the efficacy of the protocol. Safety was measured by the existence of adverse events.",
        "The mean age of the patients was 70 years, 20% were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV and 80% NYHA class III at admission. The major heart failure aetiology was ischaemic (35 patients) and valvular disease (25 patients). There were no significant differences between groups at baseline in terms of sociodemographic or pathophysiological characteristics. There was a statistically significant difference of 54.2 meters for the training group (<i>P</i>=0.026) in the 6MWT and at LCADL 12 versus 16 (<i>P</i>=0.003), but the BI did not: 96 versus 92 (<i>P</i>=0.072). No major adverse events occurred.",
        "The training protocol demonstrated safety and efficacy, promoting functional capacity. This study elucidated about the benefits of a systematised implementation of physical exercise during the patient's clinical stabilisation phase, which had not yet been demonstrated.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03838003, URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03838003."
