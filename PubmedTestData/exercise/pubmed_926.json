      "AbstractText": [
        "This article describes a one-degree-of-freedom haptic device that can be applied to perform three different exercises for shoulder rehabilitation. The device is based on a force control architecture and an adaptive speed PI controller. It is a portable equipment that is easy to use for any patient, and was optimized for rehabilitating external rotation movements of the shoulder in patients in whom this was limited by muscle-skeletal injuries. The sample consisted of 12 shoulder rehabilitation sessions with different shoulder pathologies that limited their range of shoulder mobility. The mean and standard deviations of the external rotation of shoulder were 42.91 \u00b1 4.53\u00b0 for the pre-intervention measurements and 53.88 \u00b1 4.26\u00b0 for the post-intervention measurement. In addition, patients reported high levels of acceptance of the device. Scores on the SUS questionnaire ranged from 65 to 97.5, with an average score of 82.70 \u00b1 9.21, indicating a high degree of acceptance. The preliminary results suggest that the use of this device and the incorporation of such equipment into rehabilitation services could be of great help for patients in their rehabilitation process and for physiotherapists in applying their therapies."
