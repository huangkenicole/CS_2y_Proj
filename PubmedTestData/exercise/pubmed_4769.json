        "Participation in exercise activities post spinal cord injury (SCI) can positively impact physical functioning and quality of life. Physically active individuals have improved functional performance compared with sedentary individuals with SCI. Consistent exercise interventions following SCI not only prompt neural recovery and offer myriad health benefits but they may also have persisting effects on functional abilities.",
        "A 29-year-old male subject had a 15-year history of a C5-C6 AIS B SCI. The subject demonstrated improvements in the outcome measures and he reported enhanced ability to cough and to clear secretions, as well as an enhanced overall quality of life, after undergoing a 14-week course of Spinal Mobility training in combination with inspiratory muscle training (IMT). In addition to the Spinal Mobility training and IMT, he continued to partake in his normal exercise routine, which consisted of aerobic and strength training 3 days per week.",
        "This case reaffirms the benefits of consistent exercise training, in combination with IMT, for individuals with SCI. Community programs specifically targeted to individuals with SCI are needed. The subject's functional improvements demonstrate that incorporating Spinal Mobility training into a regular exercise routine may assist with functional gains in the chronic stage of SCI."
