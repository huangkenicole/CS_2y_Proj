        "Fractional nitric oxide (FeNO) is an index of eosinophilic airway inflammation. However, the effect of acute resistance exercise on FeNO is not completely known, in non-asthmatics. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of acute resistance exercise on FeNO levels in non-asthmatics. Ten participants completed both exercise and control sessions. The resistance exercise routine consisted of three sets of 10 repetitions, each at 75 % of the one-repetition maximum, including vertical chest press, lateral pull-down, leg press, leg extension, and abdominal exercises. Additionally, FeNO levels and respiratory impedance were measured, and blood samples were collected from each participant at baseline, immediately after exercise (post), and 30\u00a0min after exercise (post 30). At baseline, post, and post 30, the FeNO levels did not significantly differ between the exercise and control sessions (17.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7 vs. 18.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 vs. 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 ppb, respectively) and exercise sessions (16.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 vs. 19.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6 vs. 18.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6 ppb, respectively). Therefore, acute resistance exercise lasting approximately 30\u00a0min did not exert an impact on FeNO levels."
