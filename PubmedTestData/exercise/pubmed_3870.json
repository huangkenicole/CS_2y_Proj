        "Cruz, LC, Teixeira-Araujo, AA, Andrade, KTP, Rocha, TCOG, Puga, GM, and Moreira, SR. Low intensity resistance exercise reduces hyperglycemia and enhances glucose control over a 24-hour period in women with type 2 diabetes. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2826-2835, 2019-The study herein aimed to compare glucose concentration and hyperglycemic responses of 24 hours after resistance exercise (RE) performed in different intensities in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Twelve women with T2D (55.2 \u00b1 4.0 years; 70.1 \u00b1 11.4 kg; and 155.7 \u00b1 3.3 cm) performed 4 experimental sessions divided into 2 blocks separated by 7 days and in randomized order: block-A (session-1: control-CONT40% and session-2: RE40% of one repetition maximum [1RM] test) and block-B (session-3: CONT80% and session-4: RE80%1RM). The RE sessions were performed over 40 minutes with 3 circuits of 7 exercises each, with 40%1RM and 80%1RM with 16 and 8 repetitions for each set, respectively. Glucose was monitored over 24 hours after each experimental session through continuous glucose-monitoring system. One-way ANOVA for repeated measures showed that area under the curve of glucose concentration was reduced (p \u2264 0.05) after RE40%1RM (193.738 \u00b1 33.186 mg\u00b7dl \u00d7 1.380 min) when compared with CONT40% (263.937 \u00b1 26.665 mg\u00b7dl \u00d7 1.380 min), CONT80% (254.721 \u00b1 35.836 mg\u00b7dl \u00d7 1.380 min), and RE80%1RM (263.966 \u00b1 62.795 mg\u00b7dl \u00d7 1.380 min). Hyperglycemia (>160 mg\u00b7dl) was less prevalent (p \u2264 0.05) during the total period after RE40%1RM (20.8 \u00b1 21.2%) when compared with CONT40% (77.4 \u00b1 18.3%), CONT80% (69.4 \u00b1 24.6%), and RE80%1RM (66.0 \u00b1 33.7%). There was a lower hyperglycemic state in RE40%1RM (p \u2264 0.05) vs. CONT40%, CONT80%, and RE80%1RM after breakfast (1:25 \u00b1 0:54 vs. 4:00 \u00b1 0:00, 3:40 \u00b1 0:53, and 3:25 \u00b1 1:09 hours, respectively), lunch (1:25 \u00b1 2:03 vs. 4:55 \u00b1 0:17, 4:25 \u00b1 1:26, and 3:40 \u00b1 2:06 hours, respectively), and dinner (0:15 \u00b1 0:27 vs. 3:15 \u00b1 0:45, 3:25 \u00b1 0:47, and 2:50 \u00b1 1:31 hours, respectively). During the sleeping period, there was a lower hyperglycemic state (p \u2264 0.05) in RE40%1RM (0:20 \u00b1 0:39 hours) vs. RE80%1RM (4:05 \u00b1 3:08 hours). A single low-intensity RE40%1RM decreases hyperglycemic prevalence over a 24-hour period and ameliorates glucose control after meals and in sleeping periods in women with T2D."
