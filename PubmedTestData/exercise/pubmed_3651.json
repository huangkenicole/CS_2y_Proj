        "Calculating the resistance provided by elastic resistance is essential with the aim of adjusting the load and controlling the progression of the exercises in programs using elastic resistance. This study aimed (1)\u00a0to establish a model of the force elongation for CLX bands; (2)\u00a0to examine whether these models are altered by different aspects of band elongation: the phase of elongation and shortening (concentric and eccentric phases), the elongation speed, and the initial resting length; and (3)\u00a0to determine the resistance value for 100% of elongation in each color and to compare it with the values reported by Theraband.",
        "Cross-sectional.",
        "Ten CLX bands of each color were elongated by 2 experienced researchers to establish their elongation force curves in series of 10 repetitions per band using a Smith machine for an anchor, examining whether elongation force models were affected by elongation and shortening phases using one 4-loop CLX band stretched to 100% and at 0.50\u00a0m/s, elongation speed stretching two 4-loop CLX bands at 0.50\u00a0m/s and at 0.70\u00a0m/s, and different starting lengths using 3 CLX bands (2, 3, and 4 loops) stretched at 0.50\u00a0m/s.",
        "No differences were found in the comparisons between phases, speeds, or different start lengths (mean errors ranged from 0.01 [0.07\u00a0N] for the blue band to 2.97 [0.94\u00a0N] for the gold band). Our values were higher than the reference values provided by Theraband for all colors, ranging from 2.3% to 33.1%.",
        "Our findings show that the values provided by the brand underestimate the resistance provided by CLX bands. To solve this, regression equations are provided so professionals can calculate the resistance of CLX bands based on their elongation. In addition, these models are not influenced by the phase of elongation and shortening, the elongation speed, and the initial resting length."
