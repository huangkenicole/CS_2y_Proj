        "Randomized cross-over study.",
        "The aim of this study was to compare exercise, the criterion standard, to the postural garment PosturePlusForce in the management of nonspecific cervical pain in women. We also analyzed both interventions with regards to baseline posture, use of pharmacological pain relievers, compliance, and comfort.",
        "The prevalence of neck pain has increased during the last decade, preferentially affecting women. Those suffering from this condition may manifest a decrease in quality of life and inability to work. Consistent recommendations highlight the importance of exercise and posture for neck pain improvement.",
        "A total of 32 female health care professionals with cervical pain (\u22653 on the visual analogue scale) entered the trial. Participants were allocated to either performing exercises or wearing the postural garment. The cross-over between interventions was separated by a 3-month washout period. Primary outcomes included pain intensity and posture. Secondary outcomes comprised cervical pain-related disability, psychological factors, physical activity, global perceived effect of treatment, and garment comfort. Treatment compliance, medication use, and adverse events were also recorded.",
        "Both interventions showed a significant improvement in pain in subjects with an adherence >60%. However, in participants with dorsal hyperkyphosis (>45\u00b0), the garment demonstrated a greater reduction in pain than exercise (P\u200a=\u200a0.019). Additionally, those wearing the garment needed fewer pain relievers than those performing exercises (P\u200a=\u200a0.007). Compliance was >50% for both interventions and comfort was contingent on season.",
        "In our study, PosturePlusForce showed, at least, a similar effect on pain to exercise, although those with dorsal hyperkyphosis exhibited a greater reduction in pain and related variables with the garment. Pain relievers were less required by those wearing PosturePlusForce than by those performing the exercises.Level of Evidence: 1."
