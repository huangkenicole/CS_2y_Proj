        "Elevation and push up (Pu) exercises are considered to be beneficial for the rehabilitation of shoulder complex pathology. Despite their clinical utility, there is a lack of evidence comparing scapulothoracic muscles recruitment during these exercises.",
        "To evaluate the EMG activity of upper trapezius (UT), Lower Trapezius (LT), Upper Serratus anterior (USa) and Lower Serratus anterior (LSa) muscles during a variety of elevation and Pu exercises.",
        "Thirteen healthy participants (non, athlete, male, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation; age: 21.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 years; height: 1.80\u00a0m\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04; weight: 79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0kg) were assessed. EMG data was collected during Scaption, wall slide and elevation with external rotation (EleEr) with and without load. Pu classic, Pu plus (PuP) on stable/unstable surfaces and Pu with shoulder internal rotation were also assessed.",
        "UT had a significant higher activity during 'Scaption load' (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and LT in 'EleEr load' and 'Scaption load' (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). USa and LSa had a significant higher activity on 'PuP unstable surface' and 'PuP internal rotation' compared to elevation exercises (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Scaption had greater activity ratio compared to the other exercises on UT/LT (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Pu variations had lower results in UT/USa and UT/LSa ratios compared to shoulder elevation exercises (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).",
        "Elevation exercises produce significant effects on upper and lower trapezius activation while Pu exercises on Sa muscles. Wall slide exercise notes the lowest activation in all muscles. A descending order of muscle activity during different variations of elevation and Pu exercises is provided in order to guide exercise selection in everyday clinical practice."
