        "Many children with special needs have body balance disorders, which will not only bring inconvenience to their daily lives but also have a certain impact on their spirits, making them insecure. It will lead to a decline in their social skills, which will also seriously affect their study and work as well as reduce their quality of life. The purpose of this paper is to design and discuss a system for evaluating and training the balance ability of children with special needs based on the integration of education cloud. The balance ability evaluation module of the system performs a series of calculations on the projection coordinates of the center of gravity of the human body in various postures, and the obtained parameter values are the basis of the evaluation. This paper analyzes the role of education cloud integration in the evaluation of balance ability of special children, evaluates and trains the balance ability of special children, and verifies the feasibility of the balance ability evaluation and training system for special children. This study found that in a feasibility trial evaluating the balance ability of children with special needs, the balance stability of the tested children was improved, and the overall balance ability improved by 60%. The balance ability evaluation training system developed in this paper can effectively improve the independent standing ability of young children. Children over the age of 4 do not have any difficulties in understanding and mastering movements, and training difficulties for children are also applicable. At the same time, the results of these exercises also showed that this kind of exercise can help children maintain their balance."
