      "AbstractText": [
        "The number of older adults residing in assisted living communities is increasing. Despite the benefits of physical activity (PA) on physical and cognitive capacities, and the opportunities for being active offered in these living environments, this population is highly sedentary and more at risk of physical decline. This study aimed to assess the feasibility, the acceptability, and the effects of PA intervention using gerontechnology in assisted living communities.",
        "Forty-two older adults in 4 assisted living communities were recruited and randomly assigned to an exercise intervention group (EX) or a control group (CON) using a 2:1 ratio. The EX group followed a 12-week PA program (2 sessions per week) using gerontechnology. Body composition, health status, quality of life, and functional capacities were evaluated at baseline, 12\u00a0weeks, and 24\u00a0weeks after baseline.",
        "Differences between groups were observed in the number of reported comorbidities (EX: 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 vs CON: 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007), SF-36 total score (EX: 80%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010% vs CON: 66%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.004), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) total score (EX: 9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 vs CON: 7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) at baseline. The EX group completed 89%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017% of the 24 prescribed sessions and realized 67%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013% of them in autonomy, reaching a quality level of 87%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%. Of the EX participants, 93.8% enjoyed the exercises a lot or well, and 92.8% of them rated the exercises as being either easy or a little difficult. Changes between baseline and follow-up were statistically different between groups for walking speed (EX:\u00a0+0.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 vs CON:\u00a0-0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0m/s; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and the SPPB score (EX:\u00a0+1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0 vs CON:\u00a0-0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03).",
        "We found that PA intervention using gerontechnology in assisted living communities for older adults was feasible and acceptable, but more importantly induced improvement in functional capacities and walking speed, which is the main predictor of mortality in the elderly population."
