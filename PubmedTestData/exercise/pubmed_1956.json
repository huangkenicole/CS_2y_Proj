        "Mobility is a crucial factor for independence and quality of life in old age. Nevertheless, many old people in retirement homes do not meet the physical activity recommendations. The aim of the Bestform-F - Best Function of Range of Motion feasibility study (bestform-F) was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a machine-based multimodal exercise training program in older residents in retirement homes.",
        "The participants (n = 77) were recruited from two retirement homes and took part in a six-month multimodal exercise training program (2x/week, 45 minutes) on pneumatic strength training machines, a balance platform and bicycle ergometers. Feasibility criteria were recruitment number \u2265 35 participants within six months, dropout rate < 40% of participants within six months of exercise, and training adherence \u2265 50% of participants taking part in at least 50% of offered training sessions. Additionally, physical performance, fear of falling, cognitive function, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after six months.",
        "For the bestform-F study, 77 (85.6 \u00b1 6.6 years; 78% women) out of 215 eligible residents from two senior residences were recruited. The dropout rate over six months was 10% (8/77 participants). The training adherence rate for the finishing participants was 77% (53/69 participants). In addition to the achieved feasibility criteria, significant improvements were recorded in the Chair Stand Test, Six-Minute Walk Test, and fear of falling after six months.",
        "All feasibility criteria have been fulfilled. The high number of recruited participants, the low dropout rate, and high adherence to the training program confirm the feasibility of a multimodal machine-based exercise training program offered to residents in retirement homes. The results provide a basis for a cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed at further investigating the efficacy of the bestform-F program."
