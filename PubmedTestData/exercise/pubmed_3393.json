      "AbstractText": [
        "Frailty is a well-recognized risk factor for adverse health-related outcomes in aging population. However, little is known about the dynamic changing nature of frailty and the potential for it to be modified within the scope of exercise. Currently, there has not been a systematic review of the impact of Otago exercise program (OEP) implementation specifically for the frail or pre-frail older adults.",
        "To determine the effectiveness of Otago exercise program on the degree of frailty, physical balance ability, mobility, grip strength and health-related quality of life in older adults with frailty or pre-frailty.",
        "We conducted literature searching in seven electronic databases, as well as hand-search of reference of included studies from inception to December 2022. Eligible studies included clinical trials of pre-frail or frail elderly receiving OEP interventions reporting on the relevant outcomes. The effect size was evaluated using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and its 95% confidence interval with random effects models. Risk of bias was appraised independently by two authors.",
        "10 trials containing 8 RCTs and 2 non-RCTs studies were included. Five studies were evaluated with some concerns in the evidence quality. The results showed that the OEP intervention could possibly reduce the level of frailty (SMD=-1.14, 95% CI: -1.68\u223c-0.06, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and improve the mobility (SMD=-2.15, 95% CI: -3.35\u223c-0.94, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and physical balance ability (SMD=2.59, 95% CI: 1.07-4.11), P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and enhance their grip strength (SMD=1.68, 95% CI=0.05\u223c3.31, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). However, no statistically significant effect of OEP on quality of life (SMD=-1.517, 95% CI=-3.18\u223c0.15, P\u00a0=\u00a00.07) in frail elderly was found based on the current evidence. The subgroup analysis indicated that participant age, different intervention total duration and per min of each session have varying degrees of impact on frail or pre-frail older people.",
        "The OEP intervention targeting older adults with frailty or pre-frailty are effective in reducing frailty, improving physical balance ability, mobility, and grip strength with low to moderate certainty. More rigorous and tailored research are still needed in the future to further enrich the evidence in these fields."
