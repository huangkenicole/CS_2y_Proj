        "The number of people engaging in self-conducted regular physical activity is increasing, but the effects of home fitness and individually planned workouts on health and metabolism are unknown. We aimed to examine the effects of regular training conducted without the supervision of professionals on exercise metabolism in our cross-sectional observational study. Forty-five physically active volunteers, classified into three groups, based on the type and frequency of their training (group 1 frequent long-term endurance, group 2 three times per week aerobic training, and group 3 two times per week short aerobic and resistance training), fulfilled a vita maxima incremental treadmill test. Aerobic capacity (VO2max), MET (metabolic equivalent of task), and metabolic responses were examined. The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Bonferroni and Scheffe multiple comparison analysis using Microsoft Excel and SPSS 23 programs. (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found between group 1 and 3 in VO2max (p = 0.46) and MET (p = 0.46) between group 1 and 2, in FatmaxHR (heart rate on maximum fat oxidation) (p= 0.04). We concluded self-conducted regular physical activity has positive effects on metabolism and health. Aerobic training performed four times per week showed the most beneficial effects on metabolism and health maintenance. In addition, based on our findings, strength training performed two times per week is recommended."
