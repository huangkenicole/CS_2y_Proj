        "The effectiveness of exercise to lower blood pressure may depend on the type and intensity of exercise. We study the short-term (i.e., 14-h) effects of a bout of high-intensity aerobic interval training (HIIT) on blood pressure in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients.",
        "Nineteen MetS patients (55.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3\u00a0years, 6 women) entered the study. Eight of them were normotensive and eleven hypertensive according to MetS threshold (\u2265130\u00a0mmHg for SBP and/or \u226585\u00a0mmHg for DBP). In the morning of 3 separated days, they underwent a cycling exercise bout of HIIT (>90% of maximal heart rate, ~85% VO<sub>2max</sub>), or a bout of isocaloric moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT; ~70% of maximal heart rate, ~60% VO<sub>2max</sub>), or a control no-exercise trial (REST). After exercise, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP; 14\u00a0h) was monitored, while subjects continued their habitual daily activities wearing a wrist-band activity monitor.",
        "No ABP differences were found for normotensive subjects. In hypertensive subjects, systolic ABP was reduced by 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0mmHg after HIIT compared to MICT and REST (130.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 vs. 137.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 and 136.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0mmHg, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, diastolic ABP was similar in all three trials (77.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 vs. 78.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 and 78.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0mmHg, respectively). Motion analysis revealed no differences among trials during the 14-h.",
        "This study suggests that the blood pressure reducing effect of a bout of exercise is influence by the intensity of exercise. A HIIT exercise bout is superior to an equivalent bout of continuous exercise when used as a non-pharmacological aid in the treatment of hypertension in MetS."
