        "To evaluate the efficacy of a 3-month exercise training program in counteracting the chronotropic incompetence and delayed heart rate recovery in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",
        "A 12-week randomized trial was conducted. Twenty-four inactive SLE patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: trained (T; n = 15, 3-month exercise program) and nontrained (NT; n = 13). A sex-, body mass index-, and age-matched healthy control (C) group (n = 8) also underwent the exercise program. Subjects were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks after training. Main measurements included the chronotropic reserve (CR) and the heart rate (HR) recovery (\u0394HRR) as defined by the difference between HR at peak exercise and at both the first (\u0394HRR1) and second (\u0394HRR2) minutes after the exercise test.",
        "Neither the NT SLE patients nor the C group presented any change in the CR or in \u0394HRR1 and \u0394HRR2 (P > 0.05). The exercise training program was effective in promoting significant increases in CR (P = 0.007, effect size [ES] 1.15) and in \u0394HRR1 and \u0394HRR2 (P = 0.009, ES 1.12 and P = 0.002, ES 1.11, respectively) in the SLE T group when compared with the NT group. Moreover, the HR response in SLE patients after training achieved parameters comparable to the C group, as evidenced by the analysis of variance and by the Z score analysis (P > 0.05, T versus C). Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores remained stable throughout the study.",
        "A 3-month exercise training program was safe and capable of reducing the chronotropic incompetence and the delayed \u0394HRR observed in physically inactive SLE patients."
