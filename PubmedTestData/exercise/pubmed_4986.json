        "To improve the quality of life in nursing homes, meaningful activities and social contact are indispensable. Exergames can play a role addressing these needs.",
        "In a randomized single blinded controlled intervention study, we investigated the effect of playing exergames on general wellbeing, fun and on social interaction.",
        "Thirty-five residents participated: 18 residents took part in the intervention group and 17 in the control group. The median mental wellbeing score of the intervention group increased from 42/50 to 45. The median sleep score of the intervention increased from 23/30 to 28. The median pain score of the intervention group improved from 18/20 to 20. The median score on subjective cognition increased from 24/30 to 26 while the mean scores on the objective assessment decreased from 1.8/2 to 1.7. Coaches gave an average fun score of 8.9/10 and an average intensity of exercise score of 11.6/20. Residents and coaches appreciated the social contact. Coaches reported a high feasibility (average of 4.1/5) but a low accessibility and a high intensity of supervision.",
        "Exergaming is a feasible and pleasant complement to the usual activities with a positive impact on wellbeing, sleep, pain, and perceived cognition. Future research should focus on vulnerable groups and aim to develop a study in an implementation design."
