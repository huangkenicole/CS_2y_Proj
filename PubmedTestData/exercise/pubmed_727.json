      "AbstractText": [
        "There is an evident lack of research simultaneously investigating endurance training (ET) and resistance training (RT) with regard to their potential influence on fitness and health status in young women. This study aimed to determine the effects of RT and ET three times a week over an eight-week period on anthropometric/body composition indices, blood pressure (BP), and muscular fitness in apparently healthy young women who participated in a self-preferred program. The sample of participants comprised 57 young healthy women (23.9 \u00b1 3.08 years, 165.5 \u00b1 5.8 cm, 66.8 \u00b1 7.2 kg) divided into ET (<i>n</i> = 18), RT (<i>n</i> = 19), and non-exercising (C) (<i>n</i> = 20) groups. The variables consisted of anthropometric/body composition indices (body mass, BMI, body fat, and lean body mass), muscular fitness variables (lower body strength, upper body strength, abdominal strength, dynamometric force, and flexibility), and cardiovascular parameters (resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP). A pre- and post-testing design, with factorial analysis of variance for repeated measurements (ANOVA: Group \u00d7 Measurement), including a consecutive post hoc test, was applied. The ANOVA indicated a similar improvement in body composition (increase in lean body mass and decrease in body fat percentage), resting heart rate, and flexibility in both of the exercise groups, with no significant changes in the C group. RT improved the participants' strength and force capacities to a greater extent than ET. BP showed a trend of improvement in both of the training groups, but without statistically significant pre- to post-changes. Correlation analysis calculated with variables of pre- to post-differences (VDs) indicated poor associations between VDs, indicating relative independence of the obtained effects for the different variables in each training group. Although this investigation comprised apparently healthy young women, numerous positive changes indicated the efficacy of both programs in a relatively short period of time. While the participants in this study self-selected training programs, the evidenced positive effects can be at least partially related to this fact."
