        "Many factors may influence the magnitude of individual responses to resistance training (RT). How the manipulation of training volume and frequency affects responsiveness level for muscle mass gain in older women has not been investigated.",
        "This study had the objective of identifying responders (RP) and non-responders (N-RP) older women for skeletal muscle mass (SMM) gain from a 12-week resistance training (RT) program. Additionally, we analyzed whether the N-RP could gain SMM with an increase in weekly training volume over 12 additional weeks of training.",
        "Thirty-nine older women (aged\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years) completed 24\u00a0weeks of a whole-body RT intervention (eight exercises, 2-3\u00d7/week, 1-2 sets of 10-15 repetitions). SMM was estimated by DXA, and the responsive cut-off value was set at two times the standard error of measurement. Participants were considered as RP if they exceeded the cut-off value after a 12-week RT phase, while the N-RP were those who failed to reach the SMM cut-off.",
        "Of the 22 participants considered to be N-RP, only 3 accumulated SMM gains (P\u2009=\u20090.250) that exceeded the cut-off point for responsiveness following 12 additional weeks of training, while 19 maintained or presented negative SMM changes. Of the 17 participants considered to be RP, all continued to gain SMM after the second 12-week RT phase. No significant correlation was observed between the changes in SMM and any baseline aspect of the participants.",
        "Our results suggest that some older women are RP, while others are N-RP to SMM gains resulting from RT. Furthermore, the non-responsiveness condition was not altered by an increase of training volume and intervention duration while RP participants continue to increase SMM; it appears that RP continue to be RP, and N-RP continue to be N-RP."
