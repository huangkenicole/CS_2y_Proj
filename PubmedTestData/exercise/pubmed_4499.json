        "Suspension training systems, which use body weight resistance under unstable conditions, may be effective for muscle strengthening in persons with scapular dyskinesis or subacromial impingement syndrome.",
        "Greater arm, scapular, and trunk muscle recruitment will occur during horizontal abduction row exercises.",
        "Descriptive laboratory study.",
        "Level 5.",
        "Surface electromyography data were collected from 28 participants (14 men, 14 women). A total of 13 right-sided muscles were studied at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) were established. Participants completed 3 repetitions per exercise in random order. We compared muscle recruitment during 3 rowing exercises: low row, high row, and horizontal abduction row. Data were compared with repeated-measures analyses of variance and post hoc Bonferroni corrections.",
        "For high row and horizontal abduction row conditions, the upper, middle, and lower trapezius and posterior deltoid demonstrated >60% MVIC magnitudes of recruitment, and the upper erector spinae demonstrated 40% to 60% MVIC magnitudes of recruitment, respectively. In contrast, in the low row exercise, 40% to 60% MVIC magnitudes of recruitment were observed only in the middle trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and posterior deltoid.",
        "With the suspension system, high row and horizontal abduction row exercises promote muscle strengthening (>50% MVIC) in the upper, middle, and lower fibers of the trapezius, posterior deltoid, and upper erector spinae.",
        "Rowing exercises performed with suspension straps may be recommended for muscle strengthening in patients with scapular dyskinesis and subacromial impingement syndrome as well as for healthy persons in need of enhanced scapular muscle performance."
