        "To evaluate the effects of dual-task aquatic exercises on functional mobility, balance and gait of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).",
        "A randomized, single-blind trial was used. Twenty-eight (28) individuals met the inclusion criteria and were randomized in the Experimental Group (EG) and Control Group (CG). EG was subjected to a dual-task aquatic exercise program, twice a week for 10 weeks. Each session lasted 40\u2009min, in a heated pool (33\u2009\u00b0C). The individuals were assessed at the beginning (AS1), after an exercise program (AS2), and after a three-month follow-up (AS3). Functional mobility (\"Timed Up & Go\" Test, and \"Five Times Sit to Stand\" Test), balance (Berg Balance Scale) and gait (Dynamic Gait Index) were verified.",
        "25 individuals were analyzed (14\u2009EG and 11 CG). There was a time-group effect of the EG when compared to the CG: TUG (p\u2009=\u20090.03 and p\u2009=\u20090.015 to AS2 and AS3), FTSST (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.004, for AS2 and AS3), BBS (p\u2009=\u20090.002 and p\u2009=\u20090.002, for AS2 and AS3), DGI (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.003, for AS2 and AS3).",
        "The suggested dual-task aquatic exercise program was able to improve functional mobility, balance and gait of individuals with PD, which shows that such type of exercise is a promising possibility of therapy."
