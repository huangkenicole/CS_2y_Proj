        "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. While it primarily affects motor function, patients eventually develop non-motor symptoms including depression, anxiety, and eventually dementia. Although there is currently no cure, treatment is aimed largely at improving quality of life though medication or surgical techniques to reduce motor symptoms. However, there is vast evidence of the benefits of physical activity as adjunct therapy for Parkinson's disease. In this review, we analyze 31 studies or reviews and highlight the role of exercise and rehabilitation in PD treatment. This study serves to provide clinicians with a comprehensive resource of the wide variety of exercises with proven benefit for patients affected by Parkinson's disease. Specifically, patients report significant improvements in motor function, cognition, mood and sleep habits."
