        "Flatfoot presents decreased medial longitudinal arch (MLA), and such foot deformity involves intrinsic foot muscles dysfunction. Flatfoot can be classified into flexible and stiff types according to arch height flexibility (AHF). Short foot exercise (SFE) is an intrinsic foot muscle strengthening exercise, which is reportedly effective against flatfoot. However, its effectiveness against flexible or stiff types in flatfoot is unclear. We examined the effect of AHF in individuals with flatfoot during abductor hallucis muscle (AbH) activity and medial longitudinal arch during SFE. Foot alignment was assessed using the arch height index during standing, and individuals with flatfoot (N\u00a0=\u00a016) were recruited. The AbH activity and MLA angle during SFE while maintaining single-leg standing were assessed. The relationship between AHF and AbH activity and between AHF and MLA angle ratio was analyzed using correlation coefficients. Additional correlations between AHF and AbH activity were observed with the outliers removed. There were no correlations between AHF and AbH muscle activity and between AHF and MLA angle ratio. However, with the 2 outliers removed, moderate correlations between AHF and AbH activity were significant (r\u00a0=\u00a00.64, p = .01). AbH activity during SFE increased in individuals with flatfoot for high AHF (flexible type). Thus, SFE may be more effective for individuals with flatfoot having a high AHF. These findings may be helpful when making decisions for surgery and rehabilitation."
