        "Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is a multifactorial condition that clinically manifests as the pelvic prolapse, urinary and/or rectal incontinence, and sexual dysfunction.",
        "We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two pelvic floor trainers for the prevention of PFD in women during the postpartum period.",
        "This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study in 70 women in the postpartum period. Participants were randomized to complete a daily, 20-min set of pelvic floor muscle exercises using the EmbaGYN (UK; Group 1, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200940) or the Magic Kegel Master device (China; Group 2, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200940) for 4\u2009weeks. All participants anonymously completed the PFDI-20 questionnaire and FSFI form at baseline and last visit. Pelvic floor muscle strength was measured using the XFT-0010 device.",
        "After the completion of the 4-week pelvic floor muscle exercise program, there was a significant decrease in the rates of all PFD symptoms including pelvic organ prolapse and urinary and/or fecal incontinence in both groups. The rates of sexual dysfunction after the exercise program decreased significantly only in Group II (69.4 versus 25.0%; <i>\u0440</i> =.001). After the program, Group I showed a significant reduction in the number of women with symptoms of urgent urinary incontinence versus baseline (35.3 versus 8.8% <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.009). Similarly, the rates of urine loss associated with coughing, sneezing or laughing in Group I decreased from 41.2% at baseline to 11.8% after the program (<i>\u0440</i> =.006) and the rates of urine leakage independent of physical activity from 23.5 to 5.9% (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.040), respectively.",
        "The 4-week postpartum pelvic floor muscle exercise program utilizing the EmbaGYN or Magic Kegel Master device has significantly increased the pelvic floor muscle strength and decreased the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, urinary and fecal incontinence. The use of the Magic Kegel Master device significantly reduced the symptoms of sexual dysfunction. The use of the EmbaGYN device was effective in addressing the individual symptoms of urinary incontinence."
