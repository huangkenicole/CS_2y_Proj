        "Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to vascular healing and neovascularisation, while exercise is an effective means to mobilise EPCs into the circulation.",

        "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were followed.",
        "thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria including 747 participants aged 19 to 76\u00a0years. All included trials used flow cytometry for identification of circulating EPCs. Eight and five different EPC phenotypes were identified in the acute and chronic trials, respectively. In the acute trials, moderate intensity continuous (MICON), maximal, prolonged endurance, resistance and high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise protocols were utilised. Prolonged endurance and resistance exercise had the most profound effect on circulating EPCs followed by maximal exercise. In the chronic trials, MICON exercise, HIIT, HIIT compared to MICON and MICON compared to exergame (exercise modality based on an interactive video game) were identified. MICON exercise had a positive effect on circulating EPCs in older sedentary individuals which was accompanied by improvements in endothelial function and arterial stiffness. Long-stage HIIT (4\u00a0min bouts) appears to be an effective means and superior than MICON exercise in mobilising circulating EPCs. In conclusion, both in acute and chronic trials the degree of exercise-induced EPC mobilisation depends upon the exercise regime applied. In future, more research is warranted to examine the dose-response relationship of different exercise forms on circulating EPCs using standardised methodology and EPC phenotype."
