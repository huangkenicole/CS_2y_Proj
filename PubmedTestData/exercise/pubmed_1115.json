        "The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of mobility training with FIVE\u00ae devices in combination with device-supported strength exercises for shoulder mobility and strength of the upper extremities in women with breast cancer.",
        "We conducted a pretest-posttest intervention study with female breast cancer patients (n = 41) who were randomly assigned to two groups by lot during their stationary follow-up treatment at a rehabilitation clinic in the south of Germany\u00a0between February and March 2020. As part of exercise therapy, the intervention group (n = 24) performed a mobility training with FIVE\u00ae devices combined with device-supported strength training, whereas the control group (n = 17) completed device-supported strength training. Before and after the 3-week intervention (3 training sessions/week), shoulder mobility and isokinetic maximal strength were tested.",
        "Both groups achieved significant improvements in shoulder mobility in the frontal and sagittal plane (between 3.8 and 15.35%; p < 0.05) and in strength performance (31.36% [IG] vs. 51.24% [CG]; p < 0.001). However, no robust evidence could be determined about potential interaction effects.",
        "A combined device-supported strength and mobility training (FIVE\u00ae) showed no advantages. Therefore, a variety of exercise methods is possible in exercise therapy of breast cancer patients.",
        "Since the\u00a0University of Education Weingarten does not assign clinical trial registration numbers or ethical approval numbers, none could be assigned for this study."
