        "Home-based and center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) have demonstrated similar levels of risk factor reduction. Cardiac rehabilitation models with fewer exercise sessions may be as effective as traditional models. This study reviewed a community phase II CR database from 2007 to 2010.",
        "A fast-track CR (FTCR) group was introduced alongside an existing traditional CR (TCR) program. The 2 programs ran concurrently on different days. Both FTCR and TCR treatment groups undertook supervised low to moderate intensity exercise training for 6 weeks and were provided with home exercise advice. Fast-track CR included once-weekly exercise sessions and a 1-time 7-hour education session; TCR included twice-weekly exercise and education sessions. Similar education was provided in both programs. Six-minute walk test distance (6MWD) was assessed pre-CR and post-CR for both groups.",
        "Six hundred and twenty patients enrolled in CR during the period, and patients elected or were assigned (not randomized) to FTCR (n = 197) or to TCR (n = 423) treatment groups. Complete 6MWD data sets were available for 115 FTCR and 254 TCR subjects. Repeated-measures analysis of variance found 6MWD outcomes to be similar for both groups over both assessments combined and at each assessment point. Improvements in 6MWD post-CR were different for men and women in the CR database (8% vs 5%, respectively, P < .001).",
        "Six-minute walk test distance outcomes were not different for subjects undergoing once-weekly or twice-weekly supervised CR exercise sessions. CR models with fewer supervised exercise sessions may provide similar functional outcomes to traditional CR models."
