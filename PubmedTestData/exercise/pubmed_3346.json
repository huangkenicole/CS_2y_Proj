        "We investigated how nonpain-based exercise therapy intensity (light-to-moderate or vigorous) affects improvements in walking performance and cardiorespiratory fitness of patients with symptomatic lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). We searched the Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases up to April 2021 and included randomized controlled trials reporting training therapies targeting exercise intensity (heart rate, oxygen consumption, or perceived exertion). The main outcomes were walking performance (pain-free [PFWD] and maximal [MWD] walking distance) and cardiorespiratory fitness (V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub>). Secondary subanalyses examined the training modality (walking or other modalities) and the approach (high-intensity interval or moderate-intensity training). A total of 1132 patients were included. Light-to-moderate was superior to vigorous exercise intensity in improving MWD (223 m [95% CI 174 to 271], <i>p</i> < 0.00001; 153 m [95% CI 113 to 193], <i>p</i> < 0.00001; respectively) and PFWD (130 m [95% CI 87 to 173], <i>p</i> < 0.00001; 83 m [95% CI 61 to 104], <i>p</i> < 0.00001; respectively). When training modalities were considered, walking at a vigorous intensity (272 m [95% CI 207 to 337], <i>p</i> < 0.00001) showed the largest improvement in MWD compared to other exercise modalities. A larger increase in V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub> was observed following vigorous (3.0 mL O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> [95% CI 2.4 to 3.6], <i>p</i> < 0.00001) compared to light-to-moderate (1.1 mL O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> [95% CI 0.4 to 1.7], <i>p</i> = 0.001) exercise intensity. These results indicate that vigorous was less effective than light-to-moderate intensity in improving walking performance, whereas it was more effective in improving V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub>. When the training modalities were considered, walking at a vigorous intensity showed the greatest improvement in MWD. <b>(PROSPERO Registration No.: CRD42020199469)</b>."
