        "The objective of this study was to investigate changes in sedentary and active behaviors when previously inactive adults start exercising in the morning or evening. One-hundred adults with overweight or obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited for a 12-week intervention and randomized to one of three groups: (i) morning exercise (AMEx; 0600-0900); (ii) evening exercise (PMEx; 1600-1900); or (iii) waitlist control. AMEx and PMEx were prescribed self-paced aerobic exercise to achieve a weekly total of 250\u00a0min via a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. Sedentary and active behavior times were measured at baseline, mid- and post-intervention using the multimedia activity recall for children and adults. Time spent engaging in physical activity was significantly increased from baseline at both mid- (+\u200914-22\u00a0min\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>) and post-intervention (+\u200912-19\u00a0min\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>), for AMEx and PMEx. At 12-weeks, participants in both morning and evening exercise groups reported increased time spent Sleeping (+\u200936 and\u2009+\u200920\u00a0min\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>, respecitively), and reduced time spent watching TV/playing videogames (-\u00a032 and -\u00a025\u00a0min\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). In response to an exercise stimulus, previously inactive adults make encouraging modifications in how they use their time, and the patterns of change are similar with morning and evening exercise."
