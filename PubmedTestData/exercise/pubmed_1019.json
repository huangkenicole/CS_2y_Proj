        "Can circuit class therapy provide sufficient exercise dosage (at least 20 minutes at \u2265 50% heart rate reserve or total caloric expenditure \u2265 300 kilocalories) to induce a cardiorespiratory fitness effect in adults with traumatic brain injury? Can feedback from heart rate monitors influence exercise intensity?",
        "Randomised controlled trial within an observational study.",
        "Fifty-three people with severe traumatic brain injury, of whom 40 progressed into the trial.",
        "All participants undertook circuit class therapy. Participants allocated to the experimental group received exercise intensity feedback from a heart rate monitor and the control group received no feedback.",
        "Proportion of participants exercising at \u2265 50% heart rate reserve for at least 20 minutes or expending \u2265 300 kilocalories during circuit class therapy. The primary outcome measure for the trial was the time spent in the heart rate training zone (ie, at \u2265 50% heart rate reserve) during the intervention and re-assessment periods.",
        "Circuit class therapy provided sufficient cardiorespiratory exercise dosage for 28% (95% CI 18 to 42) of the cohort according to the heart rate reserve criteria and 62% (95% CI 49 to 74) according to the caloric criteria. Feedback did not increase the time in the training zone during the intervention (mean difference 4.8 minutes, 95% CI -1.4 to 10.9) or re-assessment (1.9 minutes, -4.4 to 8.3) periods.",
        "The low intensity, long duration structure of circuit class therapy can provide sufficient exercise dosage for a fitness training effect for 62% of people with traumatic brain injury. Feedback from heart rate monitors does not necessarily influence exercise intensity.",
