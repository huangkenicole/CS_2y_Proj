        "Physical activity may reverse frailty in the elderly, but we encounter barriers to the implementation of exercise programs in this population. Our main aim is to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent physical activity program, versus regular medical practice, on reverting pre-frailty status among the elderly, 12\u2009months post-intervention.",
        "Randomized parallel group multicenter clinical trial located in primary care setting, among non-dependent and pre-frail patients > 70 years old, including 190 patients (95 intervention, 95 control group).",
        "Multicomponent physical activity program (MEFAP, for its acronym in Spanish) with twelve 1.5\u2009h-weekly sessions comprised of: 1. Informative session; 2. Exercises for improving aerobic resistance, muscle strength, propioception-balance and flexibility; and 3. Handing out of at-home exercise chart (twice/week). Main variable: pre-frailty according to the Fried phenotype. Secondary variables: sociodemographic, clinical and functional variables; exercise program adherence, patient satisfaction with the program and quality of life. We will perform an intention-to-treat analysis by comparing the retrogression from pre-frailty (1 or 2 Fried criteria) to robust status (0 Fried criteria) by the end of the intervention, 6\u2009months and 12\u2009months post-intervention. The accumulated incidence in each group will be calculated, as well as the relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee Hospital la Paz.",
        "Within the context of regular clinical practice, our results will provide evidence regarding the effects of exercise interventions on frailty among pre-frail older adults, a key population given their significant potential for functional, physical, and mental health improvement.",
