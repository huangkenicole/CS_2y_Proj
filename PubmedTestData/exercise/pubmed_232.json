        "Research reports limited, mixed evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy management in the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. The purpose of this review was to (1) identify what therapeutic exercises are being utilized in the non-surgical management of patients with FAI syndrome; (2) map the extent to which reported exercises reflect contributory pathomechanics associated with FAI syndrome.",
        "Scoping Review.",
        "MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and PEDRO electronic databases were searched for studies that implemented a non-surgical, exercise-based treatment approach in patients with FAI syndrome. Exercises were extracted and analyzed according to elements recognized as contributing to the pathomechanics associated with FAI syndrome.",
        "24 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 453 exercises were extracted. Uniplanar exercises accounted for 338/453 or 74.6% of all reported exercises whereas triplanar exercises accounted for 21/453 or 4.6% of all exercises. Non-weight bearing exercises accounted for 220/453 or 48.6% of all exercises.",
        "The majority of therapeutic exercises were classified as sagittal, uniplanar exercises, utilizing a concentric exercise approach. These findings highlight that exercises utilizing triplanar, eccentric hip control, in a single limb weightbearing position are considerably underrepresented."
