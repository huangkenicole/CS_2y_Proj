        "One-third of 450 female soldiers surveyed indicated that they experienced problematic urinary incontinence during exercise and field training activities. The other crucial finding of this survey was probably that 13.3% of the respondents restricted fluids significantly while participating in field exercises. Although only 5.3% of respondents felt that their urine leakage had a significant impact on their regular duties, it is obvious that many more are sufficiently worried about leakage to put themselves at significant risk for dehydration-related injuries. This study tested whether behavioral interventions effective among older people could help younger soldiers. Thirty-nine female soldiers reporting exercise-induced urinary incontinence underwent urodynamic assessments of bladder capacity, urethral closure pressure, and detrusor contraction pressures as well as a symptom questionnaire before and after therapy. They were stratified by diagnosis of physical stress incontinence or mixed urge/stress incontinence and randomized into two groups. Twenty-three participants performed pelvic muscle exercises with urethral biofeedback for 8 weeks, and 16 participants performed pelvic muscle exercises alone. Patient reports as well as the post-treatment examinations indicated that all subjects improved significantly. Only five subjects in the biofeedback/exercise and three in the exercise-only group desired further treatment. All subjects initially diagnosed with detrusor dysfunction had normal readings at the end of the study. Thus, behavioral treatments can be effective against exercise-induced urinary incontinence among most female soldiers."
