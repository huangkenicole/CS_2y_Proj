Predicting loading intensity measuring velocity in barbell hip thrust exercise. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2075-2081, 2021-The barbell hip thrust is an increasingly used exercise to target the hip extensors. Direct and indirect measurement of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) to determine the relative load of each exercise is time-consuming; therefore, practitioners may be more in favor of monitoring velocity and determining relative load through velocity-based prediction models for an exercise. This study aimed to assess the relationship between mean velocity (MV) and mean propulsive velocity (MPV) at different relative training loads (%1RM) in the barbell hip thrust exercise. One hundred two male sport science students performed an incremental 1RM testing protocol for the barbell hip thrust exercise, and a linear position transducer measured MV and MPV of the barbell. The 1RM was reached at 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 m\u00b7s-1, and the regression model generated to estimate a relative load showed an acceptable standard error of estimate (7.01 \u00b1 1.05% 1RM and 7.36 \u00b1 1.05% 1RM for MV and MPV, respectively) with a very large explained variance (R2 = 0.94). These results may have important practical applications for the prescription and monitoring of the accessory exercise of the hip thrust for monitoring training load and predicting 1RM without undertaking a RM test."
