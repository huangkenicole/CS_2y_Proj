        "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of exercise rehabilitation (ER) on the daily physical activity (PA) of cardiopulmonary patients.",
        "The impact of ER programs on the objectively measured quantity and quality of daily PA in cardiopulmonary patients is not completely understood.",
        "Participants' exercise capacity and PA were measured at baseline and at the end of the ER program (n\u00a0=\u00a037).",
        "Exercise capacity was higher at the end of the ER. Participants' sedentary time decreased while time spent in light PA increased; however, time spent in moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) did not change. There was an increase in steps/day (>1.5 METs) and PA energy expenditure (PAEE) (>1.5 METs); whereas steps/day (\u22653METs) and PAEE (\u22653 METs) remained unchanged.",
        "Findings imply that changes in daily PA in patients participating in ER occur in activities where the EE is in light intensity rather than in MVPA."
