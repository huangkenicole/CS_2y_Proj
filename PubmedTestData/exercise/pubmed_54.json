        "Aging is a natural process that may lead to detrimental health depending on someone's lifestyle, family history, psychological/psychosocial health, chronic medical conditions, and genetics. However, whether the later conditions lead to faster aging or vice versa, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and psychological health has been shown to delay the process of aging and its associated problems. Two major problems that older adults face today are the inability to perform everyday tasks (defined as activities of daily living) and the increased risk of falls. Lack of muscular function (including neuromuscular function) and bone health is associated with the inability to perform the Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and increased risk of falls. This risk of falls has been associated with cardiovascular-related mortality in older adults. Research has shown that resistance exercises can maintain normal blood glucose levels, lipids, and cholesterol, and hence the management of chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, resistance exercises hinder the process of muscular (and neuromuscular) damage, improve bone health and psychological health and sleep. This mini-review will discuss the benefits of resistance exercises on reversing or at least ceasing the process of developing conditions associated with aging."
