      "AbstractText": [
        "Patients with psoriasis do not exercise to the extent recommended for cardiovascular health, which may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome observed in this patient group. We previously identified that patients with psoriasis have significant disease-specific barriers to exercise. Others have reported that individuals with psoriasis develop higher heart rates and systolic blood pressure during bouts of exercise, followed by a slower recovery than healthy control subjects.",
        "We hypothesized that a bespoke, evidenced-based, exercise programme could be developed for patients with psoriasis.",
        "We convened a multidisciplinary Working Group comprising key stakeholders, including patients with psoriasis, along with sports scientists and clinicians, to develop the programme.",
        "To allow for different levels of fitness, lifestyle and motivation a 10-week intervention comprising two group walking sessions per week each of 1 h duration [led by a sports scientist (RS)] was designed using the Mapometer website. Walking distance was validated by a Walkmeter application, which uses global positioning system technology. The volume of exercise per session was calculated so that participants could incrementally progress to heart-healthy levels of exercise over the course of the programme. Maps of 20 unique walking routes were developed. A GENEactiv Original accelerometer and Newfeel Onwalk 900 pedometer were selected as wearable devices.",
        "We developed an exercise programme which specifically removed barriers to exercise for those with psoriasis, in partnership with patients. Regular exercise may offer significant health benefits for patients with psoriasis, including reduced CVD risk and increased psychosocial functioning, and this programme merits further investigation."
