        "There is a deleterious association between sedentary behavior and mortality risk factors. Elevated sedentary time has been reported in several studies that involved cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participants.",
        "To examine the changes in sedentary behavior, breaks in sedentary time, and physical activity (PA) in CR participants.",
        "This was a prospective repeated measures study. Sedentary behavior and PA were assessed using accelerometer at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months after CR entry.",
        "At 12 weeks, participants (n\u202f=\u202f58) spent more time in moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) and tended to be less sedentary. However, the changes were lost by 6 month follow-up. Although the majority of participants met the recommended MVPA, our participants demonstrated elevated sedentary time. We found a strong positive correlation between time in light PA and number of breaks in sedentary time; neither of which showed any changes over time.",
        "By promoting MVPA as their main target, current CR programs may have little impact on changing the elevated sedentary behavior of their participants. Further, interrupting sedentary time with light PA could be an achievable strategy to reduce sedentary behavior in CR participants."
