        "Parkinson disease is a progressive neurological disorder with no known cure or proven method of slowing progression. High-intensity, laboratory-based aerobic exercise interventions are currently being pursued as candidates for altering disease progression. The aim of this project was to evaluate the translation of a laboratory-based intervention to the community by monitoring exercise adherence (eg, attendance) and intensity (eg, heart rate [HR] and cadence) in 5 established Pedaling for Parkinson's exercise classes. A secondary aim was to determine the impact of disease severity and demographics variables on exercise adherence.",
        "A 12-month pragmatic design was utilized to monitor attendance, HR, and cadence during each Pedaling for Parkinson's class session. Over the course of 1 year, approximately 130 sessions were offered. Forty-nine (n = 30 males) persons with mild to moderate Parkinson disease from 5 community fitness facilities participated.",
        "Out of the approximately 130 cycling sessions offered at each site over 12 months, 37% of the participants attended greater than 2 classes per week (80-130 total sessions), 47% attended 1 to 1.9 classes per week (40-79 total sessions), and less than 17% attended less than 1 class per week (<40 total sessions). Average pedaling cadence was 74.1 \u00b1 9.6 rpms while average percentage of HR maximum was 68.9 \u00b1 12.0%. There were no significant differences between cycling adherence and intensity variables based on disease severity, age, or sex.",
        "Consistent attendance and exercise performance at moderate to high intensities are feasible in the context of a community-based Pedaling for Parkinson's class. Consistency and intensity of aerobic exercise have been proposed as critical features to elicit potential disease modification benefits associated with exercise. Community-based fitness programs that bring laboratory protocols to the \"real world\" are a feasible intervention to augment current Parkinson disease treatment approaches.
