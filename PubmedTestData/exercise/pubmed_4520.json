        "More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low back pain during pregnancy. This condition increases with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep.",
        "To assess the efficacy of the Pilates method in comparison to prenatal care on the control of lower back pain in pregnant women.",
        "Electronic searches were carried out with no language or year of publication restriction in the databases Medline via Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and SPORTDiscus on 20 March 2021. The keywords \"Pilates\" and \"Pregnancy\" were applied and the search strategies, adapted to each databank.",
        "Randomized clinical trials with pregnant women with muscle pain symptoms and Pilates as an intervention method in comparison to conventional prenatal care were considered.",
        "two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The critical evaluation was done using the Risk of Bias tool assess the quality and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We conducted a meta-analysis for the main outcome \"pain\".",
        "through our searches, 687 papers were identified, but only two fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Only two studies compared Pilates with a control group without physical exercise for pain in the short term. In the meta-analysis, there was a significant difference for pain in the comparison between the Pilates group and the control group without exercise; the mean difference (MD) was -23.09 (95% CI), from -31.07 to -15.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, for 65 individuals (33 in the Pilates group and 32 in the conventional group). Limitation found was the lack of blinding of therapists and participants and the small sample size of individual studies. In addition, no adverse effects were reported.",
        "There is moderate-quality evidence that Pilates exercise may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain more than usual prenatal or no exercise. Prospero registration number CRD42021223243."
