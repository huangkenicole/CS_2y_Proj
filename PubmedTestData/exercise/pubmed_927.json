        "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a severe hemato-oncological disease with high mortality and increasing incidence rate. Since evidence on exercise therapy in MM patients remains limited, this study examines feasibility, adherence, and efficacy based on real-life data from an oncologic care structure.",
        "A data evaluation of MM patients who participated in the oncologic exercise and movement therapy (OTT) at the Cologne University Hospital between 2012 and 2019 was conducted. The patient flow was incrementally reduced to four cohorts, intention-to-treat cohort (ITTC), safety cohort (SC), adherence cohort (AC), and efficacy cohort (EC). Cohorts were evaluated descriptively and by means of correlation analysis as well as group and time comparisons.",
        "Thirty patients registered at the OTT between 2012 and 2019 (ITTC). The SC (N\u2009=\u200926) attended exercise therapy on average about one session per week over a period of 8\u00a0months. One-third dropped out within 3\u00a0months. In the AC (N\u2009=\u200915), BMI at baseline exhibited a strong and very significant negative correlation with exercise adherence. In the EC (N\u2009=\u20098), a significant improvement in physical functioning and a tendency towards significance in fatigue reduction between two measurement points was observed. No adverse events were documented.",
        "The present observatory study reveals safety and feasibility while indicating adherence and efficacy of exercising MM patients under real-life therapy circumstances. Found obstacles to exercising as well as improvements in questionnaire scale scores need to be further examined in confirmatory study designs."
