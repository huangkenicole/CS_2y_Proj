        "\u2002The intervention was a 12 week exercise program, including aerobic and strengthening exercises, conducted between week 20 and 36 of pregnancy. One weekly group session was led by physiotherapists, and home exercises were encouraged twice a week. Control women received regular antenatal care.\u2002",

Among women who did not exercise prior to pregnancy, two of 100 (2.0%) women in the intervention group and nine of 95 (9.5%) in the control group had an EPDS score of \u226510 (p=0.03).\u2002",

However, a subgroup of women in the intervention group who did not exercise regularly prior to pregnancy had a reduced risk of postnatal depression."
