      "AbstractText": [
        "The knowledge about the effective implementation of different exercise training methods on clinical and endocrinological responses in soccer players with chronic low back pain (LBP) is lacking. Hence the study is proposed to find the effects of different exercise training methods on clinical and endocrinological responses in soccer players with chronic low back pain.",
        "Through the three-block randomization method, 60 chronic LBP participants were randomly divided into the isokinetic exercise group (IKE; n = 20), (CSE; n = 20), and conventional exercise group (n = 20). They received respective training for four weeks. Clinical (pain intensity & kinesiophobia) and endocrinological (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, growth hormone, prolactin, ACTH, and cortisol) values were measured at baseline, after 4 weeks, and at 3 months follow up.",
        "The baseline data between the groups showed no statistical difference (p \u2265 0.05). Four weeks following training IKE group showed significant changes in pain intensity and kinesiophobia than CSE and conventional training groups (p < 0.05). After 4 weeks of training, all the serum hormone variables show significant changes between the groups (glucose; p = 0.049, insulin; p = 0.005, HOMA-IR; p = 0.021, growth hormone; p = 0.006, prolactin; p = 0.001, ACTH; p = 0.001 and cortisol; p = 0.001). At 3 months follow up, the values for Glucose and Insulin (p > 0.05) variables did not show any statistical changes, but the rest of the variables (p = 0.001) showed significant differences. However, the maximum improvement was seen in the IKE group as calculated by the post hoc Tukey-Kramer's test.",
        "Our study suggested that strength training through isokinetic exercises improved pain, kinesiophobia status, and temporary changes in serum stress hormone levels than other training methods in soccer players with chronic low back pain."
