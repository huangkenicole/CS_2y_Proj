        "Hirsch, SM and Frost, DM. Considerations for velocity-based training: the instruction to move \"as fast as possible\" is less effective than a target velocity. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S89-S94, 2021-In addition to the potential benefits with monitoring training intensity with velocity-measuring tools during exercise, these devices also provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to provide feedback and instruction to performers in a new way. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of instructing athletes with a target velocity vs. instructing them to move \"as fast as possible\" during a free-weight bench press. In addition, the effects of each instruction on future repetition maximum (RM) test performance was compared. Thirteen male powerlifters were recruited and performed 4 sets of 5 repetitions with 45% 1RM while being instructed to attain a target velocity of 1.0 m\u00b7s-1 or to move as fast as possible. The maximum mean velocity attained in each set was compared with a repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test. After these 4 sets of 5 repetitions, the number of repetitions performed during an RM test with 75% 1RM was compared with a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Participants moved faster when they received the target velocity instruction (0.84 \u00b1 0.10 m\u00b7s-1) than when they received the \"move as fast as possible\" instruction (0.82 \u00b1 0.09 m\u00b7s-1) (p < 0.001) with no differences in the number of repetitions performed in the following RM test between the 2 testing sessions (p = 0.43). An instruction to attain a challenging velocity target may be a more effective strategy to use when attempting to elicit maximum barbell velocities during training relative to the traditional instruction to move as fast as possible."
