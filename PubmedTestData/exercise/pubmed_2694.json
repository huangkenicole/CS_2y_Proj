        "Time for preoperative optimisation prior to colorectal cancer surgery is limited and older people tend to decline exercise interventions. This study sought to describe attitudes towards, and perceptions of, preoperative physical activity and exercise in older people prior to colorectal cancer surgery.",
        "This is a qualitative interview study, analysed with inductive content analysis. Seventeen participants scheduled for colorectal surgery were recruited as a purposeful sample from two hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, face-to-face (n\u2009=\u20098) or by telephone (n\u2009=\u20099).",
        "Nine participants were male, median age was 75\u00a0years (range 70-91). The theme, 'a gap between awareness and action', was identified based on two main categories: 'Attitudes towards preoperative physical exercise have a multifactorial base' and 'Preoperative physical exercise is possible with a push in the right direction'. The material described a gap between awareness of the benefits of physical activity and reports of performing physical activity. The reasons for the gap between thoughts and action in this respect seem to be multifactorial. Support from others emerged as an important possibility for overcoming the gap.",
        "A gap between the patients' awareness and action appeared in our material. Understanding this can guide healthcare professionals (HCPs) as to the support needed preoperatively. Advice on physical exercise before surgery should be specific, and individually tailored support for action should be offered. This support should also consider the individual's current physical activity and preoperative attitude towards physical exercise."
