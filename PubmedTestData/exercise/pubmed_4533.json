        "Introduction Cardiac surgery is an aggressive procedure, inducing a great level of stress and disturbance to the homeostasis of the organism and underlying several postoperative complications. Surgical prehabilitation comprises pre-operative physical conditioning designed to improve the physiological and functional capacities of the individual, prepare the organism for surgical stress and reduce the risk of postoperative morbidity. Aim This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the ability of prehabilitation to prevent post-surgical complications in cardiac patients. Methods We selected studies conducted among patients who were waiting for non-urgent cardiac surgical procedures, where a comparison between prehabilitation and standard treatment was made. A total of 3650 possible studies were researched, of which eight were selected for inclusion. Results A reduction in the number of complications in the groups submitted to prehabilitation (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.62; p\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2\u2009</sup>=\u20090%) was observed, as well as a significant increase in maximal inspiratory pressure (standard mean difference (SMD)\u2009=\u20090.66; 95% CI: 0.35-0.96; p\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2\u2009</sup>=\u200958%), a non-significant decrease in the length of stay (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.56; 95% CI: -1.13, 0.01; p\u2009=\u20090.05; I<sup>2\u2009</sup>=\u200993%), a non-significant increase in the distance walked by the intervention group in the six-minute walk test (SMD\u2009=\u20090.89; 95% CI -0.06, 1.84; p\u2009=\u20090.07) and a lack of effect on mechanical ventilation time (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.03; 95% CI: -0.22, 0.16; p\u2009=\u20090.75; I<sup>2\u2009</sup>=\u20090%). Conclusion Prehabilitation reduces the number of post-surgical complications and increases maximal inspiratory pressure; a reduction in the length of stay and an improvement of functional capacities are also probable."
