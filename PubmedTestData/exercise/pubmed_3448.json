        "This study sought to investigate the effects of foam pad balance exercises on balance, physical performance, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life in cancer patients undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy.",
        "Thirty cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly divided into 2 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a015/group): control group (CG) and balance exercise group (BG). The BG were asked to perform foam pad balance exercises 60\u00a0min/day, twice/week for 6 weeks, along with conventional therapy. The CG only received conventional therapy. The Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Score, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (MDNS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT-Taxane) were used to assess balance, physical performance, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life, respectively, at baseline and after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment.",
        "At 4 and/or 6 weeks, the CG showed a decline in FAB and SPPB Scores, while the BG maintained their baseline levels. There were significant differences in the FAB Scores between the groups at the 4th and 6th week (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively) and significant differences in SPPB Scores at only the 6th week (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). MDNS showed no significant changes between or within groups. For FACT-Taxane between groups, the CG and BG showed significant decreases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and increases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), respectively, at 6th week.",
        "Foam pad balance exercises during chemotherapy can be used to alleviate declining balance and enhance physical performance and quality of life of cancer patients."
