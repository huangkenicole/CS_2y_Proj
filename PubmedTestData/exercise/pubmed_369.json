        "Quality of life (QoL) is an important health index for older adults.",
        "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 16\u00a0weeks of aerobic training to 8\u00a0weeks of aerobic followed by 8\u00a0weeks of combined (i.e., resistance and aerobic exercises) training, as well as to a control group on the QoL of older women exercising in the aquatic environment.",
        "52 older women were first randomized to either aerobic training (n\u2009=\u200935) or a control group (n\u2009=\u200917). After 8\u00a0weeks of intervention, participants initially assigned to the aerobic training group were again randomized to either 8 additional weeks of aerobic (n\u2009=\u200917) or combined training (n\u2009=\u200918). Aerobic training was performed at the heart rate percentage associated with the anaerobic threshold, while resistance training sets were performed at maximal effort. The control group performed low-intensity water-based therapeutic exercises. QoL was assessed before (week 0) and after the intervention (week 17) using the WHOQOL-BREEF and WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Bonferroni post hoc tests (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) were used to compare time points and groups.",
        "QoL improved significantly only in the training groups after the 16-week training intervention, whereas it remained unchanged in the control group. In addition, autonomy, environment, and present, past and future activities domains were more impacted after combined training.",
        "QoL improved only in the water-based training groups, and the addition of resistance exercises to the training program resulted in additional benefits to autonomy, environment, and past, present, and future activities domains.",
