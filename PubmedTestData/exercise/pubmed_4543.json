        "The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of dry needling therapy combined with exercise and exercise treatment alone for alleviating the dizziness caused by cervical myofascial pain syndrome.",
        "This was a prospective randomized clinical study that included 61 women who had dizziness and myofascial trigger points on the neck muscles. The patients were randomized into a dry needling\u2009+\u2009exercise group (N\u2009=\u200931) and an exercise only group (N\u2009=\u200930).",
        "The mean age of the patients (\u00b1SD) was 38.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3\u2009years. The intragroup comparisons of the severity of neck pain, algometric measurement, number of dizziness attacks per week, severity of the dizziness, fall index, and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory were improved in both groups at the first and fourth months (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The intergroup comparisons of the severity of neck pain, algometric measurement, number of dizziness attacks per week, the severity of the dizziness, and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory were more improved in the dry needling\u2009+\u2009exercise group at the first or fourth month compared with their inital assessments (P\u2009<\u20090.05). There was no diffence in fall index scores between the groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05).",
        "Both dry needling\u2009+\u2009exercise therapy and exercise therapy alone were effective in treating dizziness caused by cervical myofascial pain syndrome. However, dry needling\u2009+\u2009exercise treatment was superior to exercise treatment alone."
