        "Our aim was to describe experiences of using Nintendo Wii Fit\u2122 for balance exercise, from the perspectives of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their physiotherapists (PT).",
        "Individual interviews with 15 patients with MS were conducted, recruited from a multi-centre study investigating the effects of balance exercising using Wii Fit. We also conducted a single focus group interview with nine PT involved in the study. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using content analysis.",
        "Both patients and PT said that exercising with Wii Fit games was fun, and that it challenged the patients' physical and cognitive capacities. The competitive content in the games provided motivation to continue playing. Patients and PT reported improved body control and, more importantly, positive effects on balance and walking in daily life. The PT regarded Wii training as an effective alternative to other balance training, but some felt unsure in how to manage the video game. The patients regarded Wii training as a possible home training solution.",
        "Patients with MS and their PT considered Wii Fit exercises to be fun, challenging, and self-motivating. Exercising with Wii games can address balance impairments in MS, and can be performed at home as well as in rehabilitation settings. Implications for Rehabilitation Nintendo Wii Fit\u2122 can be used as a fun and challenging way to perform balance exercises. The competitive content embedded in the games triggers continued playing and exercising. The positive effect on balance control can improve standing and walking in everyday activities."
