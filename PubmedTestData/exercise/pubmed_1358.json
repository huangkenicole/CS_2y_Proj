        "Management of hypertension and prevention of cognitive decline are challenging public health problems. However, the effects of exergame intervention on blood pressure (BP) remain to be explored, and whether exergame intervention is an effective alternative to traditional physical exercise intervention for older adults with hypertension remains to be demonstrated. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of moderate-intensity exergame intervention and bicycle exercise training on BP and executive function in older hypertensive patients. A total of 128 participants were randomly assigned to the exergame intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a041), bicycle exercise intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a044), and control group (n\u00a0=\u00a043). The intervention groups exercised for 60\u00a0min, 3 times per week, for 16\u00a0weeks, while the control group maintained their normal lifestyle. The results revealed that there were no significant differences between two intervention groups and control group in systolic BP and diastolic BP changes (ps\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Both intervention groups demonstrated significant improvements in working memory when compared with control group (exergame intervention group: -461.9\u00a0ms, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025; bicycle exercise intervention group: -470.1\u00a0ms, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). There were no significant differences in systolic BP, diastolic BP, or working memory between the two intervention groups after 16\u00a0weeks of training (ps\u00a0>\u00a00.05). No difference in inhibition or cognitive flexibility was observed between the intervention and control groups (ps\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The current results showed that moderate-intensity exergame intervention did not produce significant benefits in reducing BP, but yielded similar beneficial effects in working memory to that of bicycle exercise intervention. More studies are needed on whether exergame intervention has the potential to be a promising supplemental therapeutic tool for older adults with hypertension."
