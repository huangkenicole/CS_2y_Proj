      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to obtain a consensus agreement from an expert panel on the metaverse for exercise rehabilitation in stroke patients using the Delphi technique.",
        "This study recruited twenty-two experts and conducted three rounds of online surveys between January and February 2023. The Delphi consensus technique was performed online to review and evaluate the framework module. A panel of experts, including scholars, physicians, physical therapists, and physical education specialists in the Republic of Korea, was invited to participate in this study. For each round, the expert consensus was defined as more than 90% of the expert panel agreeing or strongly agreeing with the proposed items.",
        "A total of twenty experts completed the three Delphi rounds. First, virtual reality-assisted (VR) treadmill walking could improve cognitive function, concentration, muscular endurance, stroke prevention, proper weight maintenance, and cardiorespiratory function. Second, related technology, safety, price, place, and securing experts would be obstacles or challenges in VR-assisted treadmill walking for stroke patients. Third, the role of exercise instructors in exercise planning, performance, and assessment for VR-assisted treadmill walking is equally important, and reeducation for them is required. Fourth, VR-assisted treadmill walking for stroke patients requires an exercise intensity of at least five times a week, about one hour each time.",
        "This study showed that the metaverse for exercise rehabilitation for stroke patients could be successfully developed and would be feasible to be implemented in the future. However, it would have limitations in terms of technology, safety, price, place, and expert factors to be overcome in the future."
