        "Acute leukemia (AL) and its initial treatment can impair physical functioning and capacity significantly. Exercise as a countermeasure has been investigated in few studies confirming its feasibility and safety during intensive induction chemotherapy, but the relative effects of diverse exercise programs have not been analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate independent effects of endurance and resistance training on physical capacity and quality of life (QOL).",
        "Twenty-nine adult AL patients were randomly allocated to an endurance (EG), resistance (RG), or control (CG) group. The intervention took place during induction chemotherapy with three exercise sessions per week for 30-45\u00a0min each. Endurance capacity at individual anaerobic threshold, maximum knee extension and flexion strength, standardized phase angle (SPA), and QOL were measured at baseline prior to induction chemotherapy and before discharge.",
        "Endurance capacity changed in neither the EG, RG, or CG (P\u2009=\u20090.104); descriptively, the EG (-\u20090.05\u00a0W/kg) and RG (-\u20090.04\u00a0W/kg) exhibited a smaller decrease than CG (-\u20090.22\u00a0W/kg). We noted a significant difference in knee extension strength (P\u2009=\u20090.002); RG improved their maximum strength (+\u20090.14\u00a0Nm/kg), while the EG's (-\u20090.13\u00a0Nm/kg) and CG's (-\u20090.19\u00a0Nm/kg) was significantly reduced. QOL and SPA revealed no change after the intervention.",
        "We conclude that resistance training is a key component when exercising during induction chemotherapy: it improved maximum strength, but also influenced endurance capacity even during intensive treatment. Considering the prognostic value of physical function, we strongly propose integrating exercise, especially resistance-based training, already during induction chemotherapy to preserve AL patients' physical capacity and functional status."
