        "Thirty participants were randomly allocated to either group (A; n= 15), treated by kinesiotape with exercise program, or the group (B; n= 15), treated by exercise program. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and Back Pain Function Scale (BPFS) were evaluated.at baseline and after 2 weeks of intervention.",
        "There were no statistically significant changes between group A and group B for baseline characteristics (p> 0.05). After two-week intervention, within group analyses revealed that VAS decreased (p< 0.05), with significant increase in BPFS (p> 0.05) in the two groups. Between group analyses showed that there was significant reduction of VAS (p< 0.05) and significant increase of BPFS (p< 0.05) in favor to group A than group B.",
