        "To evaluate whether improvements in physical function are related to changes in body composition after a three-month progressive resistance and balance exercise program among individuals approximately one to three years after stroke.",
        "In this randomized controlled trial, 43 community-dwelling subjects (65-85 years, mean age 73\u2009\u00b1\u20095 years, 73% men) were allocated to a progressive resistance and balance exercise program twice weekly for three months (intervention group [IG], n\u2009=\u200920) or a control group (n\u2009=\u200923). The main outcome measures were fat mass (kg) and fat-free mass (kg), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analyses (Tanita<sup>\u00ae</sup>). Physical function was measured using the six-minute walk test.",
        "Complete case analyses revealed reduced fat mass in the IG compared with the control (-1.5 vs. (0).13% of body weight, respectively; effect size\u2009=0.62; p\u2009=\u20090.048). In contrast, no between-group difference in fat-free mass was observed. The six-minute walk test was improved (25 vs. -10\u00a0m, respectively, effect size =0.69, p\u2009=\u20090.039) at three months in favor of the IG. The reduced fat mass was associated with an improved six-minute walk test (r\u2009=\u20090.48, p\u2009=\u20090.038) in the IG.",
        "Three-month progressive resistance and balance training was associated with reduced fat mass, which was related to improvements in walking capacity in older adults approximately one year after stroke. Implications for rehabilitation \u2003\u2002This three-month PRB group exercise program supported by motivational discussions and daily home-based exercises indicate the following: \u2003\u2002\u2022\u2002Improved walking capacity was associated with a reduction in fat mass. \u2003\u2002\u2022\u2002IGF-1 is reduced, possibly indicating improved insulin sensitivity."
