        "As a result of a cancer diagnosis and treatment, many cancer survivors experience persistent physical, mental, and emotional symptoms that affect their quality of life. Physical activity has been identified as an intervention that may help to manage the side effects of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of physical activity on overall quality of life in adult cancer survivors.",
        "One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted in person or via telephone with 13 adult (\u226518\u2009yrs) cancer survivors who had completed cancer treatment.",
        "These cancer survivors described their physical activity as improving their physical functioning and mental health, as a means of positive social engagement, and adding positivity to their daily life.",
        "Even though the cancer survivors in this study experienced diverse types of cancer and for different lengths of time as well as varying methods of treatment(s), these results support the role of physical activity in enhancing cancer survivors' quality of life. Further research is warranted to (a) expand this research with a larger sample and quantitative methods, (b) examine healthcare providers' knowledge and application of exercise guidelines to cancer survivors in cancer care, and (c) explore implementation strategies for greater advocacy for healthcare providers to share the exercise recommendations with cancer survivors."
