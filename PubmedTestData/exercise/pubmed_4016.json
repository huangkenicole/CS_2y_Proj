        "We aimed to systematically review the potential benefits of digital exercise interventions for improving measures of central obesity including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and anthropometric surrogates for VAT in overweight or centrally obese adults aged 18 or over.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases up until March 2020 (PROSPERO registration nr CRD42019126764).",
        "N\u2009=\u20095 studies including 438 participants (age 48-80) with body mass index\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> met the eligibility criteria and were included. The duration of the interventions ranged from 8 to 24\u00a0weeks. No study measured the primary outcome VAT, although in N\u2009=\u20094 studies, waist circumference (WC) decreased by between 1.3 and 5.6\u00a0cm in the intervention groups.",
        "This systematic review shows that there is no evidence for the effects of digital exercise on VAT, although digital exercise may decrease WC. These findings highlight the need for additional randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings with respect to WC, and to further investigate the effects of digital exercise on VAT. Together, this may have important implications for reducing the burden of physical inactivity and obesity."
