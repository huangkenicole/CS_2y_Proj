        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by functional disability, pain, fatigue and body composition alterations that can further impact on the physical dysfunction seen in RA. RA is also associated with systemic manifestations, most notably an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. There is strong evidence to suggest that increasing physical activity and/or exercise can simultaneously improve symptoms and reduce the impact of systemic manifestations in RA. However, implementation of interventions to facilitate increased physical activity and/or exercise within routine clinical practice is slow because of not only patient-specific and healthcare professional-related barriers but also lack of relevant infrastructure and provision. We review the evidence supporting the physiological adaptations and beneficial effects occurring as a result of increased physical activity and/or exercise in RA and propose an implementation model for facilitating the long-term engagement of patients with RA. We propose that implementation should be led, in a pragmatic manner, by rheumatology healthcare practitioners and supported by social innovation."
