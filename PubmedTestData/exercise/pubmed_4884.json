        "Eighty-four individuals with advanced cancer completed the baseline assessment, with six participants withdrawing prior to the start of the program. Of the 78 participants, 17 dropped out, thus, a total of 61 completed the final assessment. Mean adherence was 82.5%. No serious adverse events occurred.
