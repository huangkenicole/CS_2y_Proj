        "To investigate the effects of 2 modes of exercise training, upper-body alone, and the addition of electrical stimulation of the lower body, to attenuate cardiac atrophy and loss of function in individuals with acute spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "Randomized controlled trial.",
        "Rehabilitation Hospital.",
        "Volunteers (N=27; 5 women, 22 men) who were <24 months post SCI.",
        "Volunteers completed either 6 months of no structured exercise (Control), arm rowing (AO), or a combination of arm rowing with electrical stimulation of lower body paralyzed muscle (functional electrical stimulation [FES] rowing).",
        "Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on each subject prior to and 6 months after the intervention. The relations between time since injury and exercise type to cardiac structure and function were assessed via 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and with multilevel linear regression.",
        "Time since injury was significantly associated with a continuous decline in cardiac structure and systolic function, specifically, a reduction in left ventricular mass (0.197 g/month; P=.049), internal diameter during systole (0.255 mm/month; P<.001), and diastole (0.217 mm/month; P=.019), as well as cardiac output (0.048 L/month, P=.019), and left ventricular percent shortening (0.256 %/month; P=.027). These associations were not differentially affected by exercise (Control vs AO vs FES, P>.05).",
        "These results indicate that within the subacute phase of recovery from SCI there is a linear loss of left ventricular cardiac structure and systolic function that is not attenuated by current rehabilitative aerobic exercise practices. Reductions in cardiac structure and function may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals with SCI and warrants further interventions to prevent cardiac decline."
