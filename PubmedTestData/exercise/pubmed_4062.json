        "Few studies have investigated the relative safety of prescribing isometric exercise (IE) to reduce resting blood pressure (BP). This study aimed to ascertain the safety of the hemodynamic response during an IE wall squat protocol.Twenty-six hypertensive (BP of 120-139 mm Hg systolic and/or 80-90 mm Hg diastolic) males (45\u200a\u00b1\u200a8 years; 1.78\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.07\u200am; 89.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.3\u200akg; mean\u200a\u00b1\u200aSD), visited the laboratory on 2 separate occasions. Heart rate (HR) and BP were measured at rest and continuously throughout exercise. In visit 1, participants completed a continuous incremental isometric wall squat exercise test, starting at 135\u00b0 of knee flexion, decreasing by 10\u00b0 every 2 minutes until 95\u00b0 (final stage). Exercise was terminated upon completion of the test or volitional fatigue. The relationship between knee joint angle and mean HR was used to calculate the participant-specific knee joint angle required to elicit a target HR of 95% HRpeak. This angle was used to determine exercise intensity for a wall squat training session consisting of 4 \u00d7 2 minute bouts (visit 2).Systolic BPs during the exercise test and training were 173\u200a\u00b1\u200a21 mm Hg and 171\u200a\u00b1\u200a19 mm Hg, respectively, (P\u200a>\u200a.05) and were positively related (r\u200a=\u200a0.73, P\u200a<\u200a.05) with ratio limits of agreement (LoA) of 0.995\u200a\u00d7/\u00f7 1.077. Diastolic BPs were 116\u200a\u00b1\u200a14 mm Hg and 113\u200a\u00b1\u200a11 mm Hg, respectively, (P\u200a>\u200a.05) and were positively related (r\u200a=\u200a0.42, P\u200a<\u200a.05) with ratio LoA of 0.99\u200a\u00d7/\u00f7 1.107. No participant recorded a systolic BP\u200a>\u200a250 mm Hg. Diastolic BP values\u200a>\u200a115 mm Hg were recorded in 12 participants during the incremental test and 6 participants during the training session. Peak rate pressure product was 20681\u200a\u00b1\u200a3911 mm Hg bpm during the IE test and was lower (18074\u200a\u00b1\u200a3209 mm Hg\u200abpm) during the IE session (P\u200a=\u200a.002). No adverse effects were reported.Based on the current ACSM guidelines for aerobic exercise termination, systolic BP does not reach the upper limit during IE in this population. Diastolic BP exceeds 115 mm Hg in some during the IE protocol, which may suggest the need to individualise IE training prescription in some with suboptimal BP control. Future research is required to ascertain if IE requires modified BP termination guidelines."
