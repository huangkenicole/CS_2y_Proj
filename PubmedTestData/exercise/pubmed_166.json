        "Old adults show a decreased recovery performance compared to young ones after unexpected perturbations increasing the risk of falls. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a specific training of mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability on the recovery performance of old adults after simulated forward falls and the contribution of muscle strength exercise. 38 old adults (two experimental groups each n=13 and a control group, n=12) participated in the study. Group 1 exercised the mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability like increase in base of support and counter-rotating segments around the centre of mass by practicing specific tasks including these mechanisms. Group 2 exercised these mechanisms of dynamic stability and muscle strength. The exercise volume was equal in both interventions (14 weeks, two times per week and \u223c 1.5h per session). Stability performance has been examined by simulated forward falls before and after the intervention. The two experimental groups improved in a similar extent (\u223c 35%) their ability to regain balance during forward falls after the intervention. The reason was a faster increase in base of support. Further, the performance enhancement was related to an increase in the rate of hip moment generation. Exercising the mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability control in old adults affects their ability to regain balance after forward falls. A faster utilization of these mechanisms due to improved neuromuscular coordination resulted in the significant performance enhancement."
