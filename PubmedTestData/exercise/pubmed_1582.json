        "Eccentric-focused rotator cuff exercises are clinically useful in rehabilitation; however, to what extent these exercises activate shoulder musculature is unknown.",
        "Investigate peak electromyographic (EMG) activity of shoulder musculature during eccentric-focused rotator cuff exercises to inform clinical decision-making.",
        "Surface EMG activity was measured in 15 healthy subjects from 5 muscles of the dominant shoulder: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and middle deltoid. Subjects performed 5 exercises: short-to-long scaption, sit-to-stand scaption, standing external rotation (ER), sidelying ER, and sidelying horizontal adduction. The effects of exercise and muscle on peak EMG activity were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and followed with post-hoc pairwise comparisons.",
        "Significant exercise-by-muscle interaction effect was found (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001). Short-to-long and sit-to-stand scaption elicited higher activity in supraspinatus and middle deltoid compared to other exercises (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.05); however, no effect of muscle was found for these exercises (<i>p</i> >\u00a0.05). Infraspinatus and lower trapezius demonstrated higher activity compared to other muscles during standing ER, sidelying ER, and sidelying horizontal adduction (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.05).",
        "Eccentric-focused exercises sufficiently activate the rotator cuff and is effective for use in rehabilitation. Caution must be taken as some exercises do not target specific musculature."
