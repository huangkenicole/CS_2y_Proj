        "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a combined aerobic and strength program on physiological and psychological parameters in female breast cancer survivors.",
        "Randomised controlled trial.",
        "20 patients (age: 45.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0yrs) surgically treated for breast cancer that had completed all cancer therapies at least 6 months before and with no contraindications to physical activity, were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a010). Intervention group patients attend to a 24-week combined aerobic and strength training program. Physiological (i.e. VO2max, bioelectrical impedance test, maximal strength of principal muscular groups) and psychological (i.e. functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue: FACIT-F) parameters were assessed at baseline and after 24 weeks.",
        "After 24 weeks the intervention group showed significant improvement in VO2max (38.8%), strength of upper and lower limbs (ranging from 13 to 60%) and decrease in fat mass percentage (-6.3%). The FACIT-F showed significant increase in all of the three scores that can be derived (FACIT-F Trial outcome: 13%; FACT-G total score: 18%; FACIT-F total score: 15%) showing patient's quality of life (QOL) improvement. No significant change in all the parameters was found for the control group.",
        "These results show the positive effects of a combined aerobic and strength training program on breast cancer survivors and underline the importance of the early inclusion of structured physical activity in the rehabilitation protocol."
