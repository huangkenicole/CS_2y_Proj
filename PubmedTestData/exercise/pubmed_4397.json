        "This paper presents evaluation of venous return, i.e., blood flow volume of vein (BF), in the lower limb after passive exercise performed by our developed \"parallel link type human ankle rehabilitation assistive device (PHARAD)\". The PHARAD can perform complex passive exercises (plantar flexion/dorsiflexion, inversion/eversion, adduction/abduction, and combination of these motions) by reproducing input motions of a foot plate that is attached to a sole of foot. The passive exercise can be performed for not only rehabilitation but also prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this study, we measured the concentration of Total hemoglobin (Total-Hb) using multi-channel near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS)-based tissue oximeters and calculated a gradient of Total-Hb during a venous occlusion. We defined the gradient as BF and evaluated BF after 3 min passive exercise performed by the PHARAD comparing to BF of resting. Seven healthy young adult people were recruited for the experiment and we assessed passive exercise, active exercise, and walking. Experimental results show that BF after the passive exercises significantly increases compare to BF of resting and this indicates that passive exercises performed by the PHARAD increases BF and has a potential to prevent DVT."
