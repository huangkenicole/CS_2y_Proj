        "This article presents information on the benefits of exercise in counteracting the detrimental effects of bed rest, and/or severe burns. Exercise is key for maintaining physical function, lean body mass, metabolic recovery, and psychosocial health after major burn injuries. The details of an exercise training program conducted in severely burned persons are presented, as well as information on the importance of proper regulation of body temperature during exercise or physical activity. The sections on exercise and thermoregulation are followed by a section on the role of exercise in scarring and contractures. Finally, gaps in the current knowledge of exercise, thermoregulation, and contractures are presented."
