        "Tailored, challenging and progressed exercise programs addressing risk factors are recommended for preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults. Knowing the biomechanical demands of exercises commonly performed in efficacious falls prevention programs provides evidence for exercise prescription.",
        "Twenty-one non-sedentary older adults (10 men, 11 women, mean age 69 [SD 5] years) performed five standing exercises (hip abduction, side-step, squat, forward lunge, and side lunge). A biomechanical analysis of the dominant limb was performed to calculate peak joint angles and net joint moments at the ankle, knee and hip in multiple planes. Repeated-measures one-way analyses of variance followed by post-hoc comparisons were performed to identify differences in the calculated variables between exercises.",
        "Peak hip abduction moments during hip abduction were greater than during the forward lunge and squat (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). During the side-step, peak plantar flexion moments were greater than the squat and peak hip abduction moments were greater than the squat and forward lunge (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). During the squat, peak hip flexion was greatest (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) while peak plantar flexion (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and hip abduction moments (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002) were less than all other exercises. During the forward lunge, peak hip extension moments (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were greatest. During the side lunge, peak knee extension moments were greater than all other exercises (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "These biomechanical data will allow clinicians to tailor exercises for falls prevention to efficiently challenge but not overload muscle groups and minimize exercise prescription redundancies."
