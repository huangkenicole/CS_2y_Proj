        "The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a walking exercise program, three times a week for 8\u00a0weeks, on fatigue in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
        "This study was a randomized controlled trial.",
        "Walking exercise was applied to the intervention group three times a week for 8\u00a0weeks; no exercise was applied to the control group.",
        "No difference was seen between the points of pretest fatigue of the intervention and control groups (t\u00a0=\u00a0-0.788, p\u00a0=\u00a0.434). However, according to the posttest, the intervention group's point of fatigue was lower than the control groups, and this difference was statistically significant (t\u00a0=\u00a0-3.924, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001).",
        "It was found that a walking exercise program applied to patients with COPD affected the fatigue symptom positively.",
        "Walking exercises programme can be used by nurses as a reference to monitor chronic obstructive pulmoner disease patients' health status."
