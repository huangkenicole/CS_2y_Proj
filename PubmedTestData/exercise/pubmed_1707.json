        "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of resistance training of low volume and high intensity with or without photobiomodulation (PBM) on muscle strength and functional performance in post-menopausal women. Thirty-four post-menopausal women were randomized into resistance training (RTG, n\u2009=\u200917) or resistance training plus PBM (PBMG, n\u2009=\u200917). Individuals from both groups received the same RT protocol consisting of leg-press 45\u00b0, front lat pulldown, leg curl, chest press, and squat performed in two sets of 10 repetitions with a workload of 75% of one repetition maximum (1RM), twice per week, during 8\u00a0weeks. PBMG individuals also received, prior to the exercise session, PBM through a cluster containing 7 visible diodes (630\u00a0nm) and 7 infrared diodes (850\u00a0nm) with power of 100\u00a0mW each and energy of 4\u00a0J per diode, applied to the quadriceps femoris muscle; individuals from RTG received placebo PBM prior to the sessions, applied with the same device switched off. Muscle strength (1RM; isometric dynamometer), functional performance (Time Up and Go; Berg Balance Scale; 6-min walk test), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref) were performed before and after 8\u00a0weeks. Both groups increased muscle strength (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for all exercises, without group differences (p\u2009=\u20090.651). Quality of life (p\u2009=\u20090.015) and balance (p\u2009=\u20090.006) increased only in the RTG. The results suggest that PBM were not able for inducing additional benefits to RT to improve muscle strength in post-menopausal women."
