        "<b>Purpose</b>: To compare the effects of 16\u00a0weeks of aerobic training (AT) to 8\u00a0weeks of AT followed by 8\u00a0weeks of combined training (CT), as well as to a control group (CG), on the functional, cognitive and hemodynamic responses of older women exercising in the aquatic environment. <b>Materials and</b> <b>Methods</b>: The study is a three-armed parallel randomized controlled clinical trial. For this, 52 older women were first randomized in an aerobic training (AT; n = 35) or control group (CG; n = 17). After 8\u00a0weeks of intervention, participants from AT group were again randomized into another 8-week period of either AT (n\u00a0= 17) or combined training (CT; n = 18). AT was performed at the percentage of the heart rate corresponding to the anaerobic threshold, resistance training was performed with sets at maximal effort and the control group performed low-intensity therapeutic exercises in water. All outcomes were assessed before (week 0) and after the intervention (week 17). In addition, some outcomes were also investigated in the middle timepoint (week 9). Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (\u03b1\u00a0= 0.05) were used to compare timepoints and groups. <b>Results</b>: All groups similarly improved functional capacity (3-11%) and blood pressure (-4 to -10%), whereas cognitive function was not modified for any group. <b>Conclusion</b>: Water-based training programs and therapeutic exercises (i.e., CG) improve functional capacity and blood pressure responses in older women.
