        "The cardio-respiratory function is compromised in children recovering from burns, particularly, those who sustain a burn injury across the chest, which leads to further prejudicial effects on physical and psychosocial health. This study endeavored to explore the efficacy of 12 weeks of graded aerobic exercise (GAEx) on the cardiorespiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest.",
        "Thirty-six burn-injured children aged 10-18 years (%TBSA: 24.2 \u00b1 4.9, and 38.8 \u00b1 12.9 months since injury) were randomly assigned to GAEx group (n = 18; undergone a 12-week intensity- and time-graded aerobic exercise program plus standard rehabilitation) or control group (n = 18; received the standard rehabilitation only). The cardio-respiratory fitness [marked by the peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>), minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>), ventilatory equivalent of inhaled oxygen (VEq/VO<sub>2</sub>), oxygen pulse (O<sub>2</sub>P), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>), and the heart rate recovery at one minute (HRR<sub>1</sub>)] and physical and psychosocial functioning were assessed pre- and post-intervention.",
        "Children in the GAEx group showed significant increases in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (P = 0.013), V<sub>E</sub> (P = 0.026), O<sub>2</sub>P (P = 0.034), HR<sub>max</sub> (P = 0.035), and HRR<sub>1</sub> (P = 0.04) and declines in VEq/VO<sub>2</sub> (P = 0.009) and RER (P = 0.011) as compared to the control group. Additionally, the GAEx group reported higher physical (P = 0.029) and psychosocial (P = 0.012) functioning.",
        "Twelve weeks of GAEx has salutary effects on cardio-respiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest. These findings suggest that adding GAEx as a complementary therapy to the long-term rehabilitation protocol for this patient population is worthwhile."
