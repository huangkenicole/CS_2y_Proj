        "This study investigated the effect of 1\u00a0year of intradialytic exercise on older hemodialysis patients with geriatric issues.",
        "Forty-six patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years were non-randomly assigned to two groups (exercise group: 27, control group: 19). Intradialytic exercise consisted of 30\u00a0min of aerobic exercise using a cycle ergometer, and resistance training comprising four exercises using an elastic tube three times per week for 1\u00a0year. Handgrip strength, leg extremity muscle strength, 10-m walk speed, short physical performance battery, serum albumin, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), geriatric depression scale, frailty, and mobility were each assessed before and after the intervention.",
        "The control group exhibited a significant reduction in handgrip strength, 10-m walking speed, serum albumin, and GNRI after intervention compared to baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Conversely, no significant reductions were observed in the exercise group. The \u0394GNRI (effect size, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u2009-\u20095.21,\u2009-\u20090.1; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and \u0394serum albumin (effect size, 0.72; 95% CI -\u20090.31,\u2009-\u20090.02; p\u2009<\u20090.05) before and after the intervention declined significantly less in the exercise group than in the control group. Other between-group values were not significantly different. The number of frail patients and patients requiring walking assistance exhibited no significant intra-group or between-group differences before and after the intervention.",
        "Intradialytic exercise prevented the worsening of nutritional status and physical function in the exercise group compared to the control group. Exercise therapy during dialysis is an important aspect of patient care that helps prevent functional decline in older patients."
