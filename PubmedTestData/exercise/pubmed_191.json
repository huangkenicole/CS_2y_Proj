        "Reactive balance, a critical automatic movement pattern in response to a perturbation, is directly linked to fall prevention in older adults. Various exercise interventions have been broadly performed to improve reactive balance and thus prevent falls. Curiously, aquatic exercises have been suggested as an effective balance intervention and a safer alternative to exercises on dry land yet the efficacy of aquatic exercises on reactive balance has not been formally investigated. The present clinical trial aims to identify if skills acquired during aquatic exercise are more effectively transferred to a reactive balance task than land exercise. This study is designed as a double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty-four older adults aged 65 years or above who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized into an aquatic exercise group or land exercise group. Each group will participate in the same single bout intervention that includes a ball throwing and catching task. A modified lean-and-release test will be implemented on land immediately before, after, and one week after the single bout intervention. The outcomes will include reaction time, rapid response accuracy, and mini-BESTest scores obtained from stepping and grasping reactions. All statistical analyses will be conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. Our conceptual hypothesis is that participants in the aquatic exercise group will demonstrate more improved outcome scores in the lean-and-release test when compared to those in the land exercise group. The results of the present study are expected to provide evidence to support the benefits of aquatic exercises for improving reactive balance in older adults. Further, participants may find aquatic exercises safer and more motivating, thus encouraging them to participate in further aquatic exercise programs."
