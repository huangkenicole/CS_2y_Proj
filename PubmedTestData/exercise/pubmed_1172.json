      "AbstractText": [
        "The recommendation of exercise plans requires several variables to be considered (e.g., patient's conditions and preferences) and are normally complex to analyze. To facilitate this analysis we proposed the creation of an ontology to assist professionals to recommend exercises. We interviewed 2 experts and this resulted in IDEF diagram and conceptual map. The conceptual map proved to be the preferred way that experts gained more understanding compared with the IDEF diagram. In addition, we also used the conceptual map to validate the formal structure of experts' ideas. From the conceptual map we created an ontology that is being reviewed. After this, we plan to incorporate the ontology into a decision support system that will assist professionals to recommend exercises for their patients."
