        "Hand-held flexible poles which are brought into oscillation to cause alternating forces on trunk, are advocated as training devices that are supposed to solicit increased levels of stabilizing trunk muscle activity. The aim of this study was to verify this claim by comparing electromyographic (EMG) activity of trunk muscles during exercises performed with a flexible pole and a rigid pole.",
        "Twelve healthy females performed three different exercises with flexible and rigid poles. EMG activity of iliocostalis lumborum (IL), multifidus (MU), rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO), and was continuously measured. The EMG signals were analyzed in time domain by calculation of the Root Mean Square (RMS) amplitudes over 250 ms windows. The mean RMS-values over time were normalized by the maximum RMS obtained for each muscle.",
        "The IO showed a 72% greater EMG activity during the exercises performed with the flexible pole than with the rigid pole (p=0.035). In exercises performed in standing, the IO was significantly more active than when sitting (p=0.006).",
        "As intended, the cyclic forces induced by the oscillating pole did increase trunk muscle activation. However, the effect was limited and significant for the IO muscle only."
