        "To facilitate the transfer of exercise effects to older adults' everyday life, essential daily life movements (stair climbing and walking on different surfaces) were embedded into the functional movement circle for older adults (FuMoC) -- a systematic balance and resistance training programme supplemented by functional movements.",
        "This study's aim was to consider the feasibility of the FuMoC and to evaluate the effects of this new training programme in a randomised controlled pilot study.",
        "Twenty-one adults aged 60\u00a0years and older were randomised into one of two groups. The intervention group (IG; n\u00a0=\u00a011) trained for 12\u00a0weeks in the FuMoC, while the control group (CG; n\u00a0=\u00a010) maintained their usual activities. The evaluation of feasibility comprised training attendance, realised intensity of load, and perceived exertion. Outcome variables included measures of strength and performance-based tests of mobility-related activities.",
        "Training attendance was 86\u00a0% and the prescribed intensity of load was realised by the participants in the IG. Physical performance showed significant improvements in the IG in comparison to the CG: an increase of 24\u00a0% in the One-Repetition Maximum test in the chest press (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), of 9-13\u00a0% in the modified Timed Up and Go test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and of 10\u00a0% in the Maximal Step Length test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was identified.",
        "In conclusion, the FuMoC study was feasible in terms of compliance (training attendance) and the planned exercise regimen (suitable exercises, intensity, and exertion) and showed positive effects on physical performance."
