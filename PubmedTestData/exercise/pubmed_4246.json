        "The study aims to assess the effect of spinal mobilization and postural correction exercises in patients suffering from cervicogenic headache.",
        "A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 72 patients. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: spinal mobilization (<i>n</i> =\u00a024), postural correction exercises (<i>n</i> =\u00a024), and control group (<i>n</i> =\u00a024). The primary outcome measure was headache impact test-6, and secondary outcomes were headache intensity, neck pain intensity, and neck pain-related disability measured at baseline, postintervention, and follow-up period.",
        "Comparison of baseline data (at 0\u00a0weeks) among groups showed a statistically nonsignificant difference. There was statistically significant improvement at postintervention (immediately after fourth week) in postural correction exercises group [headache disability: 14.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.91 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); headache intensity: 2.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.24 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); neck disability: 27.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.71 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); neck pain: 1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.44 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001)] and spinal mobilization group [headache disability: 13.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.21 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); headache intensity: 2.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.23 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); neck disability: 23.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.51 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001); neck pain: 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001)] as compared to the control group. The result of within-group analysis suggests that there was a statistically significant improvement in postintervention (immediately after fourth week) and follow-up (immediately after eighth week) scores as compared to baseline (at 0 weeks) scores for all outcomes in postural correction exercises [headache disability (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), headache intensity (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), neck disability (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), neck pain (<i>p</i> <\u00a00 .001)] as well as in spinal mobilization group [headache disability (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), headache intensity (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), neck disability (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001), neck pain (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001 for pre versus post; <i>p</i> =\u00a0.001 for pre versus follow-up)]. There was a statistically nonsignificant difference between postintervention and follow-up scores of all the outcomes in the postural correction exercise and spinal mobilization group, which indicates that improvement in these groups was maintained during the follow-up period.",
