        "Falls among older people are of growing concern globally. Implementing cost-effective strategies for their prevention is of utmost importance given the ageing population and associated potential for increased costs of fall-related injury over the next decades. The purpose of this study was to undertake a cost-utility analysis and secondary cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare system perspective, of a group-based exercise program compared to routine care for falls prevention in an older community-dwelling population.",
        "A decision analysis using a decision tree model was based on the results of a previously published randomised controlled trial with a community-dwelling population aged over 70. Measures of falls, fall-related injuries and resource use were directly obtained from trial data and supplemented by literature-based utility measures. A sub-group analysis was performed of women only. Cost estimates are reported in 2010 British Pound Sterling (GBP).",
        "The ICER of GBP\u00a351,483 per QALY for the base case analysis was well above the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of GBP\u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 per QALY, but in a sensitivity analysis with minimised program implementation the incremental cost reached GBP\u00a325,678 per QALY. The ICER value at 95% confidence in the base case analysis was GBP\u00a399,664 per QALY and GBP\u00a350,549 per QALY in the lower cost analysis. Males had a 44% lower injury rate if they fell, compared to females resulting in a more favourable ICER for the women only analysis. For women only the ICER was GBP\u00a322,986 per QALY in the base case and was below the cost-effectiveness threshold for all other variations of program implementation. The ICER value at 95% confidence was GBP\u00a348,212 in the women only base case analysis and GBP\u00a323,645 in the lower cost analysis. The base case incremental cost per fall averted was GBP\u00a3652 (GBP\u00a3616 for women only). A threshold analysis indicates that this exercise program cannot realistically break even.",
        "The results suggest that this exercise program is cost-effective for women only. There is no evidence to support its cost-effectiveness in a group of mixed gender unless the costs of program implementation are minimal. Conservative assumptions may have underestimated the true cost-effectiveness of the program."
