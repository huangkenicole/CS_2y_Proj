        "The purpose of this study was to understand the exercise levels, preferences and interests of prostate cancer survivors in Canada.",
        "An electronic survey was administered via a prostate cancer-specific website and assessed self-reported exercise levels, exercise preferences and interests, exercise barriers and facilitators to exercise.",
        "Based on 103 participants, the majority (75.7%) of prostate cancer survivors did not meet both aerobic and resistance exercise guidelines, despite an interest in exercise. Strongest exercise preferences were shown for resistance exercise, walking, flexibility and bicycling and for performing exercise from a community-based gym or from home. Significant differences in exercise interests and facilitators were found between individuals who were meeting exercise guidelines compared to those who were not.",
        "The majority of Canadian prostate cancer survivors are insufficiently active. Exercise preferences and facilitators appear to be influenced by current exercise levels. Resistance and aerobic exercise should be considered when programming exercise for prostate cancer survivors."
