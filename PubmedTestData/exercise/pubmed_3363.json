        "The object of the presented experiment was to construct a cam to provide the optimal load while training the muscles throughout the entire range of motion of a joint. The starting point for our consideration was the flexion of the elbow joint - based on its functioning, we wished to verify the efficacy of the cam during various workout routines.",
        "The experiment was two-fold. In the first part, muscle flexion torque values were measured for 78 male participants, under static conditions and at four different angles of the elbow joint. Subsequently, the data was analyzed and based on the resulting graph the shape of a cam was determined. In the next stage, 75 men underwent training using two types of machines designed to exercise the elbow joint's flexors, one with a mounted cam and one with a disc plate.",
        "The strength and power changes were found to be more pronounced in the workouts conducted with the cam-equipped machine.",
        "Our conclusion stemming from this project is that a cam, designed specifically to customize and optimize the external load to the muscle strength potential during training, results in a safer, more efficient in terms of promoting the desired training effect and a more comfortable workout."
