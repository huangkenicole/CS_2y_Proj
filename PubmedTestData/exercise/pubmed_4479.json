        "Although exercise has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory and metabolic outcomes in people with HIV, its effect on cognitive ability remains understudied. Our study aimed to estimate the feasibility and efficacy potential of a 12-week aerobic and resistance training program on cognitive and physical performance outcomes. This is an externally controlled, two time-point, feasibility study within a larger study using a cohort multiple randomized controlled design yielding 3 groups: intervention group; comparison group and refusers. The intervention consisted of high-intensity interval training and resistance exercises 3 days/week. Specific feasibility and brain health outcomes were evaluated. Cognitive ability was ascertained by the Brief Cognitive Ability Measure (B-CAM) in all three groups. Standardized tests of physical performance were performed in the intervention group. Effect size, 95% confidence intervals, responder status analyses and reliable change indices were computed. Adherence to the intervention schedule and acceptability outcomes were good. There was no reliable change on B-CAM in the exercise group. Most physical performance measures benefited from the exercise training (effect sizes: 0.2 - 1.5). Although the 12-week exercise program improved physical capacity, it did not yield gains in cognitive ability in HIV. Further research is required to determine the exercise parameters that could benefit cognition."
