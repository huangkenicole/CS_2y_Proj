        "BACKGROUND Pelvic floor muscle exercises are a widely used and well-established form of stress incontinence treatment, with success rates varying from 21% to 84%, although with a better subjective than objective outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS \"Incontinence Impact Questionnaire\" (IIQ), PFM EMG assessment was done at the beginning and after the 6-week training program. RESULTS Statistically significant differences appeared in the BASE and R values. In the symptomatic group (with SUI symptoms), the value of BASE was 3.26 \u00b5V, and after training it was 3.95 \u00b5V. The R values before and after training were 4.55 \u00b5V and 4.25 \u00b5V. In the symptomatic group (without SUI symptoms), the value of BASE was 2.88 \u00b5V and 3.52 \u00b5V and R values were 7.16 \u00b5V and 3.92 \u00b5V. In the control group, BASE was 3.05 \u00b5V and 4.11 \u00b5V and R was 7.82 \u00b5V and 4.39 \u00b5V. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a 6-week training process influences PFM EMG activity in pregnant women. During Q, the value of PFM activity after a training session tended to increase in the symptomatic and control groups, but in the symptomatic group it remains practically unchanged. Our results show the probable process of decreasing control of PFM activity during long-lasting contractions in symptomatic and control women. The comparison of BASE before and after training averaged the values of R after five 10-s contractions and showed an increase in the Base and decrease in the R."
