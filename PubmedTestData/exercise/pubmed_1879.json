        "Exercise is a non-pharmacological strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of aging on brain health. However, a large amount of variation exists in its efficacy. Sex of participants and exercise type are two possible factors contributing to this variation. To better understand this, we conducted a concurrent systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitively healthy older adults. Executive functions, episodic memory, visuospatial function, word fluency, processing speed and global cognitive function were examined for exercise- and sex-dependent effects. For executive functions, three types of exercise interventions - aerobic training, resistance training, and multimodal training (i.e., both aerobic and resistance training) - were associated with larger effect sizes in studies comprised of a higher percentage of women compared to studies with a lower percentage of women. This suggests that women's executive processes may benefit more from exercise than men. Regardless of sex, compared to control, all three exercise training approaches enhanced visuospatial function, but only multimodal training enhanced episodic memory. Overall, aerobic training led to greater benefits than resistance training in global cognitive function and executive functions, while multimodal combined training led to greater benefits than aerobic training for global cognitive function, episodic memory, and word fluency. Possible underlying mechanisms, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and sex steroid hormones, are discussed."
