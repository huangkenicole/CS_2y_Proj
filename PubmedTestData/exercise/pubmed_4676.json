        "The traditional dogma of putting mobile patients with acute deep vein thrombosis into bed for several days has been challenged by some studies that showed a better clinical outcome with walking exercises under good compression. Repeated lung scans did not show an increased risk of new pulmonary embolism. There was a faster and more intense reduction of pain and swelling and a clear quality-of-life benefit. Immediate ambulation with compression reduces the propagation of thrombi and has a positive impact regarding development of postthrombotic syndrome. Patients selected for home therapy should not only be instructed how to inject their low-molecular-weight heparin but should also be educated to walk around with good compression. Until now the important principle of avoiding the venous stasis associated with bed rest has found broad acceptance in the field of primary prevention of venous thromboembolism. Modern antithrombotic management of patients with acute venous thrombosis should include early ambulation in conjunction with appropriate compression therapy."
