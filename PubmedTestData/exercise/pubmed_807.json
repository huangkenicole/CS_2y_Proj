        "To determine the effect of Chinese massage combined with core stability exercises on nonspecific low back pain.",
        "In the prospective study, ninety-two participants with nonspecific low back pain were divided into experimental and control group at random, and 46 in each. The experimental group were treated using Chinese massage combined with core stability exercises, while the control group were treated using Chinese massage alone. The two groups were evaluated using visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index at baseline, immediately after two and eight weeks. In addition, the recurrence rate of nonspecific low back pain was evaluated one year after the last intervention.",
        "Two weeks after treatment, both VAS and ODI scores decreased significantly in two groups (p<0.05), when compared with the values before treatment, but no difference between the two groups (p>0.05). Eight weeks later, the VAS and ODI scores decreased significantly in both groups (p<0.05); at the same time, both VAS and ODI scores were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the experimental group than those in the control group. At the final follow-up, five cases recurred in the experimental group and nineteen cases in the control group, the control group has a significantly higher recurrence rate (p<0.05).",
