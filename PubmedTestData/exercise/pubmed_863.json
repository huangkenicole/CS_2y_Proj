        "In acquired scoliosis, the degree of the curve is initially low and its type becomes apparent only after it has progressed. The characteristics of scoliosis include an abnormal spatial arrangement of individual body segments, which the central nervous system (CNS) interprets as a defect and automatically launches compensatory mechanisms. Neglecting low-degree scoliosis poses a two-fold danger. It usually leads to the development of structural changes, while the child gets used to the abnormal body arrangement, thus reinforcing the poor postural habits. The basic aim of early rehabilitation is to manage the compensatory mechanisms and prevent the development of adverse secondary changes, rehabilitation in scoliosis being no exception.Some cases of scoliosis require surgery. The point is to minimise the changes resulting from the progression of scoliosis. The role of corrective exercises seems to be significant here. However, views on the usefulness of such exercises are sometimes extremely varied, even though both favourable and sceptical opinions are not fully supported by the literature. However, a number of reports indicate that corrective exercises are useful. <br /> The selection and of corrective exercises and how they should be performed are another question. A number of methods of conservative treatment of scoliosis have been devised. Currently, none of them is considered a comprehensive regimen since each patient requires an individual approach. The most difficult aspect is to ensure that local correction translates to the automatic maintenance of the corrected body posture in a standing position. This is facilitated by corrective exercises supported with biofeedback. <br /> The aim of this paper is to elucidate this complex issue that often leads to divergent and improper attitudes to the conservative treatment of scoliosis."
