      "AbstractText": [
        "The impact of exercise interventions on physical activity (PA) remains undetermined in intermittent claudication, which is why it is important to include objectively measured PA as an additional endpoint. The aim of this prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial was to investigate the impact of unsupervised Nordic pole walk advice (WA) alone or in combination with hospital-based supervised exercise (SEP) or home-based structured exercise (HSEP) on PA in patients with intermittent claudication.",
        "In total, 166 patients with intermittent claudication (mean age\u2009=\u200972 [SD\u2009=\u20097.4] y; 41% women) were randomized to 3 intermittent claudication-treatment strategies: WA, WA\u2009+\u2009SEP, or WA\u2009+\u2009HSEP. All patients received Nordic poles and standardized WA (\u226530\u00a0min, 3 times weekly). Patients randomized to HSEP and SEP accepted participation in an additional 6-months exercise program. PA was measured with an accelerometer-based activPAL3 monitor for 7\u00a0days at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months. PA outcomes were steps per day, time spent within a stepping cadence \u2265100 steps per minute, time spent upright, number of body transitions from sitting to standing, and number of sitting bouts of >30\u00a0minutes and\u2009>60\u00a0minutes.",
        "At 1\u00a0year, no intergroup differences were observed in any of the PA variables, whereas significant intergroup differences were observed at 3\u00a0months regarding time spent within a stepping time cadence \u2265100 steps per minute. The mean change for HSEP (2.47 [SD\u2009=\u200910.85] min) was significantly different from the mean change for WA (-3.20 [SD\u2009=\u20096.24] min). At 6\u00a0months, the number of sitting bouts (>60\u00a0min) for SEP was significantly different from WA (mean change\u2009=\u20090.24 [SD\u2009=\u20090.69] vs -0.23 [SD\u2009=\u20090.81]).",
        "This study indicates that the addition of 6\u00a0months of HSEP or SEP does not improve PA at 1\u00a0year, as compared to unsupervised WA alone. Factors of importance for increasing PA in patients with intermittent claudication require further investigation.",
        "At the 1-year follow-up, the addition of intermittent claudication-tailored additional exercise strategies did not improve daily PA in patients with intermittent claudication compared with unsupervised Nordic pole WA alone. Future studies may explore the role of behavior change techniques to increase PA in this patient group."
