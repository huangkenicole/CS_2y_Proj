        "The aim of the study was to analyze the profile of fibromyalgia patients receiving medical advice to walk and who complied with the advice according to a specific clinical pattern. A further aim has been to analyze the elements that increase adherence to walking.",
        "A cross-sectional study with 920 women with fibromyalgia.",
        "Sociodemographic and clinical variables, walking behavior, and medical advice to walk were assessed.",
        "Patients who adhere to walking have a lower likelihood of being tired. Regular walkers (patients who walk according to a specific clinical pattern) have a lower likelihood of comorbidity. Patients who receive medical advice to walk are more likely to walk more than 30 minutes and to take a break between bouts.",
        "Nurses caring for people with fibromyalgia should include strategies to promote walking, especially in patients with low adherence profiles, paying attention to all elements of behavior."
