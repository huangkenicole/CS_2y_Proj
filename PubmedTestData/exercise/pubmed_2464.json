        "The rationale for this case report was to identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with prescribing the Turkish Get-Up as an isometric shoulder and neck exercise. The Turkish getup is an effective tool for isometrically loading the cervical spine and shoulder and can be used with minimal space and equipment.",
        "The Turkish Get-Up was selectively applied as a therapeutic corrective intervention to a patient suffering a mild to moderate cervical, acromio-clavicular and sterno-clavicular joint sprain with associated facet syndrome and muscle spasm. There were concerns that initially gave a guarded prognosis with the realization that further imaging may be warranted after an initial trial.",
        "The Turkish getup is an effective tool for isometrically loading the cervical spine and shoulder and can be used with minimal space and equipment. This exercise allowed the injured patient to integrate full body movement and conditioning with an emphasis on pain free isometric shoulder and cervical spine contractions to re-establish strength and motor control. The patient now has the ability to add to his training and rehabilitation an exercise that can be endlessly progressed to build continuous strength, endurance and motor control."
