        "There is little evidence about the lived experience of older people who have completed a falls prevention exercise programme and their life beyond their intervention.",
        "A phenomenological interview study with 23 participants (12 females), mean age 81\u2009years (range 74-93\u2009years), residing in their own homes across England, who had participated in a falls prevention exercise intervention within the Prevention of Falls Injury Trial (PreFIT). The aims were to explore their experiences of: i. being in a clinical trial involving exercise. ii. exercise once their falls prevention intervention had finished. Interpretative data analysis was informed by van Manen's (1997) framework for phenomenological data.",
        "Analysis of interviews about experiences of participating in PreFIT and what happened once the falls intervention ended identified five themes: Happy to help; Exercise behaviours; \"It keeps me going\"; \"It wasn't a real fall\"; and Loss. Participants did not continue their specific exercises after they had completed the intervention. They preferred walking as their main exercise, and none reported preventing falls as a motivator to continue exercising. Participant experiences suggest that they have their own ideas about what constitutes a fall and there is disparity between their interpretation and the definition used by healthcare professionals and researchers.",
        "Despite good intentions and perceived benefits, on-going participation in falls prevention exercises beyond a structured, supervised intervention was not a priority for these older people. Promoting continuation of falls prevention exercises post-intervention is just as challenging as promoting uptake to and adherence during exercise programmes."
