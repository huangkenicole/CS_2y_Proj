        "Health education is one of the main items to enable health promotion to patients with fibromyalgia. The objective of the study \"Amigos de Fibro (Fibro Friends)\" is to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention associated with physical exercise based on the web in promoting health and quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia in Brazil.",
        "A study with a randomized controlled trial approach will be carried out. The sample will consist of 24 participants, divided into two groups, with 12 individuals each. The experimental group will participate in meetings with lectures, debates, conversation rounds and exercises by a multidisciplinary team. Physical exercises will also be performed in an online environment. On the other hand, the control group will receive an e-book of education and self-care. Primary outcomes will be quality of life. The secondary outcomes will be sociodemographic and health profile, pain intensity, sleep quality, self-care agency, usage and costs of health and social care services, viability of the program and program participation. In addition, a qualitative evaluation process will be carried out with the participants. After the intervention, the data of both groups will be collected again, as well as after 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months to verify the effect and the maintenance of the intervention.",
        "The results will provide data for studies to consider the use of this tool in the future by professionals working in the field of rheumatology.",
        "The protocol was registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials RBR-3rh759 ( https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=RBR-3rh759 ). Date of registration: 07/02/2020]."
