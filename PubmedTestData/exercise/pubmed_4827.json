        "Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a new kind of magnetic resonance imaging technology. Its imaging principle is to distinguish different pathological tissues according to the movement of water molecules, which is higher than regular magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging has exact utility price in medical analysis and sickness evaluation. However, there are few researches on the utility of diffusion tensor imaging in the rehabilitation comparison of patients. This paper explores the utility of magnetic resonance DTI science in evaluating the impact of postoperative patients' exercising rehabilitation. Taking stroke patients as an example, through giving patients rehabilitation training method, using magnetic resonance DTI technology, the motor function rehabilitation of patients was evaluated, and FA changes of the affected side and healthy side and Fugl-Meyer score of two groups of patients before and after rehabilitation were observed. The software outcomes exhibit that, in the contrast of rehabilitation therapy impact of motor feature in sufferers with cerebral infarction, the use of magnetic resonance DTI technological know-how gives a foundation for clinicians to deeply apprehend the CST involvement of patients, which helps to scientifically evaluate the effect and quality of limb motor rehabilitation training of patients and provides a basis for disease treatment."
