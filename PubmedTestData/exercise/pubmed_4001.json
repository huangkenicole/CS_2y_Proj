        "Brown-S\u00e9quard Syndrome (BSS) is a rare neurological condition associated with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). Hemisection of the spinal cord causes paralysis of the homolateral side, and thermoalgesic dysfunction on the opposite side. Cardiopulmonary and metabolic alterations have been reported. For all these patients, regular physical activity is highly recommended and functional electrical stimulation (FES) may be a good option, especially for those with paraplegia. However, to our knowledge, the effects of FES have primarily been studied in those with complete SCI and data regarding application and effects in patients with incomplete lesions (with sensory feedback) is lacking. The present case report therefore evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a 3-month FES-rowing program in a patient with BSS.",
        "Knee extensor muscle strength and thickness, walking and rowing capacities as well as quality of life were evaluated before and after 3 months of FES-rowing (two sessions per week) in a 54 year old patient with BSS.",
        "The individual had excellent tolerance and adherence to the training protocol. All measured parameters were greatly improved after 3 months: on average,\u2009+\u200930% rowing capacity,\u2009+\u200926% walking capacity,\u2009+\u200924.5% isometric strength,\u2009+\u200921.9% quadriceps muscle thickness,\u2009+\u200934.5% quality of life.",
        "FES-rowing appears to be well tolerated and highly beneficial for a patient with incomplete SCI and could therefore be considered as an appealing exercise option for these patients."
