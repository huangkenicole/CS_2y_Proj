      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted everyday life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, but its clinical impact has not been illustrated. In this study, we investigated the change in physical activity and subsequently clinical symptoms of PD during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "We enrolled PD patients who were able to ambulate independently and had visited our clinic at Samsung Medical Centre from December 2019 to January 2020 (baseline) and in May 2020 (follow-up during the COVID-19 crisis), and divided them into either 'the sustained exercise group' or 'the reduced exercise group'. Then, we assessed the change in the exercise and clinical features between these two groups over the study period.",
        "A total of 100 subjects were recruited. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount, duration and frequency of exercise were reduced. There was decrease in number of patients who do indoor-solo exercise and increase in that of patients who do not exercise. One third reported subjective worsening of both motor and non-motor features, although Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 score was similar. Additionally, the reduced exercise group reported more motor and non-motor aggravation than the sustained exercise group, despite lack of significant difference in the UPDRS part 3 score.",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic had a clear impact on exercise and subjective symptoms in PD patients, with reduced exercise being related to a subjective increase in both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Maintaining exercise should therefore be emphasized even in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic."
