        "In people recovering from traumatic brain injury, is a 3-month ballistic resistance training program targeting three lower limb muscle groups more effective than non-ballistic exercise rehabilitation for improving mobility, strength and balance? Does improved mobility translate to better health-related quality of life?",
        "A prospective, multicentre, randomised trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and blinded measurement.",
        "A total of 144 people with a neurological movement disorder affecting mobility as a result of traumatic brain injury.",
        "For 3 months, the experimental group had three 60-minute sessions of non-ballistic exercise rehabilitation per week replaced by ballistic resistance training. The control group had non-ballistic exercise rehabilitation of equivalent time. The non-ballistic exercise rehabilitation consisted of balance exercises, lower limb stretching, conventional strengthening exercises, cardiovascular fitness training and gait training.",
        "The primary outcome was mobility measured using the High-Level Mobility Assessment Tool (HiMAT). Secondary outcomes were walking speed, strength, balance and quality of life. They were measured at baseline (0 months), after completion of the 3-month intervention (3 months) and 3 months after cessation of intervention (6 months).",
        "After 3 months of ballistic resistance training, the experimental group scored 3 points (95% CI 0 to 6) higher on the 54-point HiMAT than the control group and remained 3 points (95% CI -1 to 6) higher at 6 months. Although there was a transient decrement in balance at 3 months in the experimental group, the interventions had similar effects on all secondary outcomes by 6 months. Participants with a baseline HiMAT < 27 gained greater benefit from ballistic training: 6 points (1 to 10) on the HiMAT.",
        "This randomised trial shows that ballistic resistance training has a similar or better effect on mobility than non-ballistic training in people with traumatic brain injury. It may be better targeted towards those with more severe mobility limitations.",
