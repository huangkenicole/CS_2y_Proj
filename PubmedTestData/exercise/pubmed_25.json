      "AbstractText": [
        "The current literature contains multiple examples of exercise interventions to foster health and to prevent/treat many chronic non-communicable diseases; stress and functional syndromes. On the other hand, sedentariness is increasing and to transform a sedentary subject into a regular exerciser is not only very difficult but considered by some unrealistic in current clinical practice. Ideally a physical activity intervention may be considered actually efficacious when it outgrows the research setting and becomes embedded in a system, ensuring maintenance and sustainability of its health benefits. Physicians need specific skills to improve patients' exercise habits. These range from traditional clinical competencies, to technical competencies to correctly prescribe exercise, to competencies in behavioral medicine to motivate the subject. From a behavioral and medical point of view, an exercise prescription may be considered correct only if the subject actually performs the prescribed exercise and this results in an improvement of physiological mechanisms such as endocrine, immunological and autonomic controls. Here we describe a model of intervention intended to nurture exercise prescription in everyday clinical setting. It aims to a tailored prescription, starts from the subject's assessment, continues defining clinical goals/possible limitations and ends when the subject is performing exercise obtaining results."
