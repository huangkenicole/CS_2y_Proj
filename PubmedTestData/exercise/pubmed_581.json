        "This case report aimed to investigate the effects of supervised home-based resistance training (RT) on functional capacity and mental health on a man with idiopathic peripheral polyneuropathy (PP).",
        "A 50-year-old man diagnosed with PP with no previous experience in RT performed 24 session of home-based RT for 12 weeks. Resistance training consisted of 3 exercises performed with 3 sets and lasted approximately 30\u00a0min per session. Exercises were performed with minimal implements (e.g., elastic tubes and light dumbbells). The Patient was evaluated for muscle performance, functionality, anxiety levels, and depressive symptoms before and after intervention period. Muscle performance was evaluated though 30-s push up test (PU30), functional capacity was evaluated through functional tests [sit to stand test (SST), arm curl (AC), and 2-min step test (2-MST)] and anxiety levels and depressive symptoms were evaluated through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI), respectively.",
        "After 12 weeks, the performance on PU30 increased 40% (from 8 to 11 repetitions), while the performance on SST, AC and 2-MST increased 100% (from 4 to 8 repetitions), 44% (from 16 to 23 repetitions) and 157% (from 47 to 121 repetitions), respectively. Anxiety state and trait levels have been reduced 24% (from 42 to 32 scores) and 4% (from 47 to 45 scores), respectively. There was no change for BDI.",
        "Supervised home-based RT using low cost and affordable equipment was a feasible strategy to provide functional capacity and mental health benefits in a patient with PP."
