      "AbstractText": [
        "There is considerable evidence for the efficacy of moderate-intensity continuous exercise benefitting clinically relevant outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, persons with MS who have walking disability (pwMS-wd) are severely deconditioned and may achieve superior benefits by engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT), especially while utilizing adaptive equipment, such as recumbent arm/leg stepping (RSTEP). The proposed study will assess the feasibility of a 12-week, RSTEP HIIT program in pwMS-wd. The secondary aim will examine changes in aerobic fitness, physical activity, ambulation, upper arm function, cognition, fatigue, and depression as clinically relevant efficacy outcomes following the 12-week, RSTEP HIIT intervention.",
        "The study will recruit 15 pwMS-wd. Feasibility will be measured via process, resource, management, and scientific outcomes throughout the entirety of the research study. The secondary, clinically relevant outcomes will consist of a neurological exam, aerobic capacity, physical activity, ambulation, cognition, upper arm function, fatigue, and depression. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T1), midpoint (T2, following 6\u00a0weeks), and post-intervention (T3, following 12\u00a0weeks). The intervention will involve 12\u2009weeks of supervised, individualized HIIT sessions two to three times per week. The individual HIIT sessions will each involve 10\u2009cycles of 60-s intervals at the wattage associated with 90% VO<sub>2peak</sub> followed by 60\u00a0s of active recovery intervals at 15\u2009W, totaling 20\u2009min in length plus 5-min warm-up and cool-down periods.",
        "The feasibility design of the proposed study will provide experience and preliminary data for advancing towards a proof-of-concept study comparing HIIT to moderate-intensity continuous RSTEP for improving clinically relevant outcomes in a randomized control trial design. The results will be disseminated via manuscripts for publication and a report for distribution among the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.",
