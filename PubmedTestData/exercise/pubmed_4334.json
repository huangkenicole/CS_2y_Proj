        "To evaluate/compare the effects of the Bobath concept and task-oriented training on motor function, muscle thickness, balance, gait, and perception of goal achievement in patients with stroke.",
        "Thirty-two patients were randomly divided into Bobath and task-oriented groups. Exercises were applied for one hour a day, three days a week, for eight weeks. Clinical (Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM), Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), balance, gait)) and trunk muscle thickness assessments (with ultrasound) were performed.",
        "Thirty patients completed the study. TIS, STREAM, and GAS scores were increased in both groups (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Bilateral rectus abdominis thickness was found to have increased in the Bobath group whereby this increase was better when compared with the task-oriented group (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The limits of stability increased in both groups (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Postural sway was decreased in the anteroposterior (normal stability eyes open) in the Bobath group and the anteroposterior (perturbated stability eyes closed) in the task-oriented group. Velocity, step length, and functional ambulation profile scores increased, and double support of the paretic side decreased in the task-oriented group (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "The Bobath concept appears to be superior to task-oriented training in increasing the thickness of rectus abdominis in patients with stroke. Although the task-oriented training provided significant improvement, especially in terms of gait, no superiority was found between the two rehabilitation approaches in terms of functional ability."
