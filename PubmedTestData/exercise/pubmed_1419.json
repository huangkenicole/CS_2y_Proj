      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of inpatient rehabilitation on pulmonary function in patients recovering from COVID-19, a multifaceted disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This aspect of recovery is crucial, as pneumonia associated with this disease can cause lung-function abnormalities with varying degrees of hypoxemia. This study involved 150 patients qualified for inpatient rehabilitation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional assessment of the lungs was performed by spirometry. The mean age of patients was 64.66 (\u00b111.93) years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.16 (\u00b15.68). The tests showed a statistically significant improvement in spirometric parameters. The rehabilitation program based on aerobic, strength, and endurance exercises improved lung-function parameters in the long term. The improvement in spirometric parameters in patients after COVID-19 may be related to body mass index (BMI)."
