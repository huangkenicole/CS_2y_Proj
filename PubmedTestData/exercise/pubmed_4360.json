        "To summarise the extent, nature, and quality of current scholarly literature related to non-pharmacological, rehabilitation interventions following concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury in children.",
        "An electronic search was conducted from 1987 to 24 October 2017. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) full text, peer reviewed, and written in English, (2) original research, (3) diagnosed concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, (4) described the evaluation of an intervention, (5) the outcome was a concussion impairment, and (6) the mean/median age was under 19. Quality assessment using the Down's and Black criteria was conducted.",
        "Twenty-six studies published between 2001 and 2017 were identified. Interventions included rest, active rehabilitation, exercise, vestibular, oculomotor, cervicospinal therapy, education, early intervention, telephone counselling, mobile health application, Web-based Self-Management program, multimodal physical therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, and acupuncture. The quality assessments ranged from poor to good.",
        "The literature describing interventions following concussion in children is scarce. While both positive and negative results were obtained, there were methodological concerns in most studies limiting the ability to draw conclusions. Interventions incorporating aerobic exercise show promise as a concussion management strategy. Implications for rehabilitation Few studies have examined rehabilitation interventions for youth following concussion. Research ranging from rest to exercise highlights the uncertainty of the field. Low quality research limits the generalizability of results. The use of physical activity appears to be an emerging area of interest. Individualised, aerobic exercise should be used as part of clinical management."
