        "To explore the relationship of exercise timing (exercising close to bedtime, exercising in daylight and maintaining fixed exercise schedule) with sleep quality, fatigue and rest-activity rhythms among lung cancer patients in Taiwan.",
        "Results from 43 lung cancer patients who were assigned and adhered to the exercise intervention in a 12-week randomised controlled trial were analysed. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Actigraphs were used to assess rest-activity rhythms (in-bed less than out-of-bed dichotomy index, I\u00a0<\u00a0O) and objective sleep parameters, including total sleep time (TST) and sleep onset latency (SOL).",
        "Patients who exercised >4\u00a0hr before bedtime had significant improvement in fatigue (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), sleep quality (p\u00a0=\u00a0.012 for PSQI; p\u00a0=\u00a0.037 for TST; p\u00a0=\u00a0.017 for SOL) and rest-activity rhythms (p\u00a0=\u00a0.048 for I\u00a0<\u00a0O). Furthermore, patients who exercised with daylight exposure had a significant improvement in fatigue (p\u00a0=\u00a0.037) and sleep quality (p\u00a0=\u00a0.039 for PSQI).",
        "Exercising >4\u00a0hr before bedtime with daylight exposure is associated with improvement in rest-activity rhythms, sleep quality and fatigue in lung cancer patients. The causal relationship requires further investigation with experimental design."
