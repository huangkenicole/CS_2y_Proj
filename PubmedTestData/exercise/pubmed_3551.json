        "Compared with normal people, patients with intellectual disability have poor cardiopulmonary and muscle fitness levels, and their daily physical activity generally cannot reach the \"guideline-recommended amount,\" which increases the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease in this group. From the perspective of six elements of exercise prescription (frequency, intensity, time, form of exercise, amount of exercise, and progressive rate), this paper systematically reviews the current situation of the formulation and implementation of exercise prescription for patients with intellectual disabilities. The results show that the design idea of aerobic fitness exercise prescription for patients with intellectual impairment follows the six-element <sup>5</sup>paradigm, but the insufficient recommended amount of each element is a common problem. In the design of muscle fitness exercise prescription, due to the differences of different exercise forms, the description of the six elements is very inconsistent. Although most prescription execution effects show that it is beneficial to improve cardiopulmonary and muscle fitness, there is a great debate on whether it is beneficial to improve body composition. People with intellectual disabilities are highly heterogeneous groups. In the initial stage of exercise intervention, the elements of exercise prescription need to be adjusted individually to obtain sustainable positive benefits."
