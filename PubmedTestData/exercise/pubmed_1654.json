        "The treatment of most esophageal cancer patients includes chemo(radio)therapy and extensive surgery, causing physical decline with loss of muscles. This trial aimed to test the hypothesis that a tailored home-based physical activity (PA) intervention improves muscle strength and mass in patients having undergone curative treatment for esophageal cancer.",
        "Patients operated for esophageal cancer 1\u00a0year earlier were included in a nationwide randomized controlled trial in Sweden in 2016-2020. The intervention group was randomized to a 12-week home-based exercise program, while the control group was encouraged to maintain routine daily PA. The primary outcomes were changes in maximal/average hand grip strength measured with hand grip dynamometer and lower extremity strength measured using 30-second chair stand test and muscle mass measured using a portable bio-impedance analysis monitor. Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and results were presented as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",
        "Among 161 randomized patients, 134 completed the study, 64 in the intervention group and 70 in the control group. Compared with the control group (MD 2.73; 95% CI 1.75-3.71), patients in the intervention group (MD 4.48; 95% CI 3.18-5.80) had statistically significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) improved lower extremity strength. No differences were seen for hand grip strength or muscle mass.",
