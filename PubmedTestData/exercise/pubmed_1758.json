      "AbstractText": [
        "Chronic ventilatory failure (CVF) may be associated with reduced exercise capacity. Long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may reduce patients' symptoms, improve health-related quality of life and reduce mortality and hospitalisations. There is an increasing use of NIV during exercise training with the purpose to train patients at intensity levels higher than allowed by their pathophysiological conditions.",
        "This narrative review describes the possibility to train patients with CVF and NIV use as a tool to increase the benefits of exercise training.",
        "We searched papers published between 1985 and 2018 in (or with the summary in) English language in PubMed and Scopus databases using the keywords \"chronic respiratory failure AND exercise,\" \"non invasive ventilation AND exercise,\" \"pulmonary rehabilitation\" and \"exercise training.\"",
        "Exercise training is feasible and effective also in patients with CVF. Assisted ventilation can improve exercise tolerance in different clinical conditions. In patients under long-term home ventilatory support, NIV administered also during walking results in improved oxygenation, decreased dyspnoea and increased walking distance. Continuous positive airway pressure and different modalities of assisted ventilation have been delivered through different interfaces during exercise training programmes. Patients with CVF on long-term NIV may benefit from exercising with the same ventilators, interfaces and settings as used at home.",
        "We need more randomised clinical trials to investigate the effects of NIV on exercise training in patients with CVF and define organisation and setting."
