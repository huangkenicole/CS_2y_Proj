        "Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity in children. Treatment strategies aim to halt progression of the curve. Mild scoliosis is in many cases observed or, in some cases, treated with scoliosis-specific exercises. More severe curves are treated mainly with a brace. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis-specific exercises compared to observation in adolescents with mild idiopathic scoliosis.",
        "Subjects. Previously untreated and skeletally immature children aged 9-15 years of age with idiopathic scoliosis (curve magnitude Cobb 15-24 degrees) will be included. A total of 90 subjects will be included to receive one of two possible interventions. Interventions. Both groups will receive a physical activity prescription according to the World Health Organization recommendations. The intervention group will receive an additional active self-correction treatment strategy for curve correction and will have outpatient sessions once every two weeks for the first three months. They will be prescribed to do the exercises at least three times per week. The intervention will be performed until skeletal maturity or progression of the curve. Outcome. The subjects will participate in the study until curve progression or until skeletal maturity (defined as less than 1 cm growth for six months). The primary outcome variable is failure of treatment, defined as progression of the Cobb angle more than 6 degrees on two consecutive x-rays compared to the baseline x-ray. Secondary outcome measures include patient-reported outcomes, clinical characteristics (i.e. angle of trunk rotation and trunk asymmetry) and number requiring brace treatment. Clinical follow-ups will be performed every six months and radiographs will be taken annually.",
        "This study will compare effectiveness of an active self-corrective exercise strategy in mild idiopathic scoliosis with observation in terms of halting curve progression."
