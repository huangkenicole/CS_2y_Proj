        "Altered motor control and proprioceptive deficits are associated with kinematics dysfunctions and may cause alterations in subacromial space (SAS) that could lead to shoulder pathologies. Dimensions of the subacromial space, as well as interventions aimed at its normal restitution, can be explored by ultrasound (US).",
        "To describe the effect of two shoulder girdle motor control exercises with cognitive training strategies on SAS dimensions, measured with US.",
        "Cognitive movement control strategies, with visual and haptic feedback were applied on 21 healthy participants. SAS dimensions were measured through <i>in vivo</i> variations of acromiohumeral (AHD) and coracohumeral distances (CHD) using US.",
        "Our results show that as exercise repetitions are performed, an increasing trend in both measures can be observed, being wider for AHD (i.e. humeral head descent exercise) than CHD (i.e. scapular retraction exercise).",
        "Specific cognitive and motor control exercises improve congruence joint and centering of the humeral head."
