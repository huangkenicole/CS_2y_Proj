        "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is characterized with high morbidity, high mortality, long hospitalization and frequent revisits. It has been the most serious coronary artery diseases in the world. A large body of clinical evidence demonstrates that exercise is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, different types of exercise have become the central to most cardiac rehabilitation/risk reduction programs. However, the detailed effects of exercise in ACS is still unclear and there is still lack of evidence on which exercise regimen may be ideal for ACS. This chapter presents a brief review of the pathophysiology of ACS and the relationship between exercise and the cardiovascular system. Besides that, this chapter also provide an updated discussion of the most relevant discoveries regarding to exercise and its role in managing ACS in clinical studies."
