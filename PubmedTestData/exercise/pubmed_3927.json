      "AbstractText": [
        "Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have lower physical activity (PA) than children with typical development (TD). PA and fundamental movement skills (FMS) are positively associated so interventions that promote FMS of children with DCD are recommended.",
        "To examine the effects of a school-based FMS training program on motor functions, PA and other psychological outcomes.",
        "A total of 131 primary children were allocated to FMS training groups (DCD-FMS n\u2009=\u200935, TD-FMS n\u2009=\u200929), which received FMS training (eight weekly 40-min sessions), or to control groups (DCD-C n\u2009=\u200934, TD-C n\u2009=\u200933), which received conventional physical education lessons. Outcome measures, including accelerometer-assessed PA, motor functions, and self-perceived competence and enjoyment, were measured at baseline, 1-week (immediate effect), 3-months (short-term effect) and 12-months (longer-term effect) after the intervention.",
        "FMS training resulted in improved FMS proficiency and increased PA and enjoyment of activity participation in children. In particular, the DCD-FMS group reported greater enjoyment over time. Some effects were also evident for both short- and longer-term.",
        "The findings suggest that a school-based FMS training program has the potential to promote physical and psychological health in children with DCD in the long run."
