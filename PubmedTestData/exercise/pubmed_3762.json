        "Adherence has been proposed as a major barrier to implementing and maintaining the benefits of osteoarthritis (OA) core treatments and is influenced by many factors. Although there are reasonable data to support factors influencing adherence to exercise/physical activity in knee/hip OA populations, there is less research examining alternative interventions, or in the hand OA population. This problem is complicated by the lack of gold-standard measurement of adherence for core osteoarthritis treatments. The predictors of treatment adherence are not well understood, and findings are contradictory. Strategies incorporating behavior change techniques should be implemented to improve and maintain long-term adherence."
