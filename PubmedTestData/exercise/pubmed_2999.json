        "The aim of this study is to assess in older adults with memory complaints, the effects of a 6-month home-based physical activity (PA) intervention on short-term adherence, short and long-term self-efficacy and the predictors of adherence.",
        "Participants with memory complaints with or without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were recruited from Perth, Western Australia between May 2004 and July 2006 and randomly assigned to a control or an intervention group. The intervention group received a 6-month PA programme and recorded sessions on a diary. Pedometer readings, questionnaires, and physical and cognitive measures were completed at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months.",
        "One hundred and seventy participants started the study. Retention rates were similar for both groups at all time-points however retention was higher for men than women (P<0.01). Adherence to the prescribed PA was 72.8% (95% CI, 70.8 74.9%). Men had higher adherence rate than women (P<0.001). Those with and without MCI had similar adherence. Compared to controls self-efficacy was higher in the intervention group after 6 months only (P<0.01).",
        "Older adults with memory complaints, with or without MCI, can successfully participate in and enjoy home-based PA programmes. Long-term adherence to such interventions may require continued support and increased self-efficacy. (",
