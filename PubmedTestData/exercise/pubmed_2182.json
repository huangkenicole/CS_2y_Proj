        "Regular exercise is associated with a\u00a0lower risk of macrosomy and caesarean section during childbirth. Depression is a\u00a0 common complication in the prenatal and postnatal period due to increased stress and insufficient social support. Exercise is a\u00a0potential non-pharmacological therapy. Regular exercise is also associated with lowering blood glucose and improving insulin sensitivity. To optimize weight and overweight, exercise is one of the main parts of treatment. Another therapeutic possibility of using the exercise is to influence the pain in the lumbosacral area and also the pain in the pelvic area. Another variant of exercises are exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor. Exercise of the pelvic floor muscles in the perinatal period is an effective method for preventing postpartum urinary incontinence.",
