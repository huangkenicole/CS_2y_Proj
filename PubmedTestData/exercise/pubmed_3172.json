      "AbstractText": [
        "Over the past few decades, people with epilepsy were advised not to engage in sports based on the fear that sporting activity may cause injuries, potentially induce seizures, and have a negative effect on disease course. However, in recent years, numerous studies have indicated a positive role of physical exercise in reducing the frequency of seizures and improving health condition of patients with epilepsy. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different physical exercise programs on the symptomatology and health condition of individuals with epilepsy and provide guidance for selecting the optimal modality of physical exercise for patients with epilepsy via a meta-analysis of available literature.",
        "A literature search was carried out in MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, Embase, China National Knowledge (CNKI), and Wan fang databases to gather relevant data about different physical exercise modalities and epilepsy. We will use Endnote X9 software for studies selection and Stata16.0 software for the data analysis.",
        "This present study aimed to provide the most up to date evidence and recommendations for clinicians and epilepsy patients to choose an optimal type of exercise.",
        "Aerobic exercise and resistance exercises both had a positive effect on epilepsy patients. Persons with epilepsy should be encouraged to participate in sports activities.INPLASY registration number: INPLASY202220070."
