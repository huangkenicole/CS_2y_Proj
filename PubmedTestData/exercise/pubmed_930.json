        "An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is performed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients before hemodialysis, who may benefit from exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an exercise program associated with partial limb blood flow restriction (BFR) on handgrip strength (HGS) and forearm circumference of CKD patients.",
        "A total of 26 patients with CKD were randomized to the BFR experimental group (EG, n\u00a0=\u00a012) and to the non-BFR control group (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a014) prior to AVF, and underwent isometric exercises for the flexor muscles of the fingers and elbow where the AVF will be performed.",
        "There were no differences at the end of eight weeks of training between the EG and CG groups [F (1.23)\u00a0=\u00a00.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.96] regarding the HGS and the forearm circumference [F (1.23)\u00a0=\u00a00.90, p\u00a0=\u00a00.76], however muscle strength [F (1.23)\u00a0=\u00a0189.84, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001] and forearm circumference [F (1.23)\u00a0=\u00a0540.90, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001] improved between baseline and the results at the end of the program.",
        "Partial BFR training was not superior to the CG for the outcomes evaluated in this study. Further studies should be conducted so that an indication of an exercise protocol for the evaluated outcomes is prescribed in order to be effectively offered in clinical practice."
