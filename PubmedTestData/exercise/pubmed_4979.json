        "Isometric exercise is often prescribed during rehabilitation from injury to maintain muscle condition and prevent disuse atrophy. However, such exercise can lead to muscle soreness and damage. Here we investigate which parameters of isometric contractions are responsible for the damage. Bouts of 30 repetitions of maximum voluntary contractions of elbow flexors in 38 subjects were carried out and peak force, soreness, and tenderness were measured before the exercise, immediately afterwards, at 2 h, and at 24 h postexercise. When one arm was held near the optimum angle for force generation (90\u00b0), the force it produced was greater by 28% than by the other arm held at a longer length (155\u00b0). However, despite the smaller contraction forces of the muscle held at the longer length, after the exercise it exhibited a greater fall in force that persisted out to 24 h (20% fall) and more delayed soreness than the muscle exercised at 90\u00b0 (7% fall at 24 h). The result indicates a length dependence of the damage process for isometric contractions at maximum effort. In four additional experiments, evidence was provided that the damage occurred during the plateau of the contraction and not the rising or relaxation phases. The damage had a prompt onset and was cumulative, continuing for the duration of the contraction. We interpret our findings in terms of the nonuniform lengthening of sarcomeres during the plateau of the contractions and conclude that muscle damage from isometric exercise is minimized if carried out at lengths below the optimum, using half-maximum or smaller contractions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Isometric exercise, where muscle contracts while the limb is held fixed, is often possible for individuals rehabilitating from injury and can help maintain muscle condition. Such exercise has been reported to cause some muscle damage and soreness. We confirm this and show that to minimize damage, exercising muscles should be held at shorter than the optimum length for force and carried out at half-maximum effort or less."
