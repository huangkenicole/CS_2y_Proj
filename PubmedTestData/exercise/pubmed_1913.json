        "Exercise is one of the only nonpharmacological remedies known to counteract genetic and chronic diseases by enhancing health and improving life span. Although the many benefits of regular physical activity have been recognized for some time, the intricate and complex signaling systems triggered at the onset of exercise have only recently begun to be uncovered. Exercising muscles initiate a coordinated, multisystemic, metabolic rewiring, which is communicated to distant organs by various molecular mediators. The field of exercise research has been expanding beyond the musculoskeletal system, with interest from industry to provide realistic models and exercise mimetics that evoke a whole body rejuvenation response. The 18th International Biochemistry of Exercise conference took place in Toronto, Canada, from May 25 to May 28, 2022, with more than 400 attendees. Here, we provide an overview of the most cutting-edge exercise-related research presented by 66 speakers, focusing on new developments in topics ranging from molecular and cellular mechanisms of exercise adaptations to exercise therapy and management of disease and aging. We also describe how the manipulation of these signaling pathways can uncover therapeutic avenues for improving human health and quality of life."
