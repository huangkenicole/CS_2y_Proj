        "LIVESTRONG at the YMCA is an evidence-based 12-week physical activity (PA) program for cancer survivors. The purpose of our study was to understand the factors that motivated cancer survivors to begin the program, how the program impacted their habits, and how their experience influenced their motivation to continue with the program.",
        "Key informant interviews.",
        "Phone interviews conducted between April 15 and June 1, 2020.",
        "27 cancer survivors in Texas who previously participated in the LS program.",
        "Participants completed a 30- to 60-minute interview with one of four interviewers. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes.",
        "Most interviewees were motivated to begin the program because of a desire to feel better after treatment. The most cited motivator to continue in the program was the community of cancer survivors. During the program, interviewees enjoyed learning different exercises, the community of cancer survivors, and the supportive teachers. Nearly all interviewees adopted or changed a healthy habit as a result of the program.",
        "These results could be used by healthcare professionals to better understand what motivates cancer survivors to participate in a PA program. Results could also be used to plan or modify other PA programs for cancer survivors."
