      "AbstractText": [
        "Telerehabilitation has gained significance as a tool to deliver and supervise therapy and training as effective as traditional rehabilitation methods yet more accessible and affordable. An exergame-based telerehabilitation system has recently been developed within the scope of the international Continuum-of-Care (COCARE) project. The system comprises training devices for use in clinics (Dividat Senso) and at home (Dividat Senso Flex), an assessment system, and a rehabilitation cockpit, and its focus lies on home-based motor-cognitive training, which is remotely managed by health care professionals (HPs).",
        "This study aims to analyze the usability, acceptance, and enjoyment of the COCARE system from the perspective of primary (older adults [OAs]) and secondary (HPs) end users.",
        "At 3 trial sites (located in Switzerland, Italy, and Cyprus), participants engaged in a single-session trial of the COCARE system, including testing of exergames and assessments. Mixed methods encompassing qualitative approaches (eg, think aloud) and quantitative measures (eg, Exergame Enjoyment Questionnaire [EEQ], System Usability Scale [SUS], and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology [UTAUT] questionnaire) were used to analyze participants' perceptions of the system and identify potential barriers to its implementation in a home setting. In addition, the associations of performance during gameplay and assessments, demographics, and training motivation (Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 [BREQ-3]) with usability, acceptance, and enjoyment were explored.",
        "A total of 45 OAs and 15 HPs participated in this study. The COCARE system achieved good acceptance ratings (OAs: 83%, range 36%-100% and HPs: 81%, range 63.8%-93.3% of the maximum score), and OAs indicated high enjoyment (mean 73.3, SD 12.7 out of 100 points in the EEQ) during the exergame session. The system's usability, assessed with the SUS, received scores of 68.1 (SD 18.8; OAs) and 70.7 (SD 12.3; HPs) out of 100 points, with substantial differences observed between the trial sites. Several requirements for improvement were identified. Commonly mentioned barriers to adoption included the movement-recognition sensitivity of the Senso Flex, its limited markings, and difficulties in understanding certain instructions for assessments and games. Performance in games and assessments showed the highest significant correlations with the SUS (Spearman \u03c1=0.35, P=.02 to \u03c1=0.52, P<.001). The BREQ-3 had significant correlations with all usability measures, thereby even large significant correlations with enjoyment (Spearman \u03c1=0.58; P<.001). Age had moderately significant correlations with the SUS (Spearman \u03c1=-0.35; P=.02) and the UTAUT total score (\u03c1=-0.35; P=.02) but no significant correlation with the EEQ. Concerning sex and years of education, no significant correlations were found.",
        "The study's findings will inform the further development of the COCARE system toward a user-friendly and widely accepted version, enhancing cognitive and physical functions in OAs. Future randomized controlled trials should evaluate the system's feasibility and effectiveness."
