      "AbstractText": [
        "Research suggests that exercise training (ET) programmes may improve both physical and psychosocial functioning in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients. Most of this research has been conducted by means of quantitative methods. However, knowledge of older ICD recipients' experiences of participating in such programmes is sparse. There is thus a need for more detailed qualitative data from the perspective of older patients.",
        "To describe older ICD recipients' experiences of participating in an ET programme.",
        "A qualitative design with semistructured interviews involving 12 older ICD recipients who had participated in a 3-month ET programme. Mini-disc recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis.",
        "The analysis revealed two major themes: (1) 'increased confidence to engage in physical exertion'; and (2) 'increased satisfaction with life'. The first theme is illustrated by three subthemes: 'perceived support from physiotherapists', 'perceiving the heart rate monitor as a motivation to exercise', and 'perceiving peers as motivators for enjoyment and making the effort to exercise'. The second theme was illustrated by the following subthemes: 'perceived psychosocial benefits', 'perceived physical benefits', and 'exercise as a new health habit'.",
        "The findings indicate that exercising in a cardiac rehabilitation centre together with peers and supervised by skilled healthcare professionals may increase motivation to exert oneself, leading to emotional and physical benefits as well as a more social and active lifestyle for older ICD recipients."
