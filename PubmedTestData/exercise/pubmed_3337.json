      "AbstractText": [
        "More than 50% of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) report no regular exercise due to numerous barriers to participation. Tele-exercise services offer viable solutions to reduce barriers. However, limited evidence for SCI-specific tele-exercise programs is available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a synchronous group tele-exercise program designed for individuals with SCI.",
        "Explanatory sequential mixed-methods design assessed feasibility of a synchronous 2-month biweekly group tele-exercise program for individuals with SCI. Numeric measures of feasibility were first collected (recruitment rate, sample features, retention, attendance), followed by postprogram interviews with participants. Thematic analysis of experiential feedback elaborated on numeric findings.",
        "Eleven volunteers (ages = 49.5 \u00b1 16.7 years) with SCI (range: 2.7-33.0 years) enrolled within 2 weeks of recruitment initiation. Retention was 100% retention at program completion. Median number of live classes attended per participant was 10 (62.5%). Participants described that attendance and satisfaction were facilitated by program-specific features including coinstruction by instructors with SCI-specific knowledge and lived experience, as well as group structure. Participants reported increased exercise knowledge, confidence, and motivation.",
        "This study demonstrated feasibility of a synchronous group tele-exercise class for individuals with SCI. Key features facilitating participation include class length, frequency, coleadership by individuals familiar with SCI and exercise instruction, and group motivation. These findings begin to examine a viable tele-service strategy that could be employed as a bridge among rehabilitation specialists, community fitness instructors, and clients with SCI to increase physical activity access and behavior.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1 available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A442 )."
