        "It has been shown that supervised balance training is effective in improving balance performance in children but relatively costly in terms of personnel, materials, and time. Integrating balance exercises into daily routines such as tooth brushing reduces these needs, but its effectiveness is unknown.",
        "This study investigated the impact of balance exercises performed during daily tooth brushing on measures of static and dynamic balance in healthy children.",
        "Fifty-five healthy children were assigned to either an intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a032, age: 9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 years) or a control (n\u00a0=\u00a023, age: 9.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 years) group. Participants of the intervention group performed progressive balance exercises while tooth brushing on a daily basis (2 sessions per day\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0min per session) for eight weeks. Static (i.e., timed one-legged stance test [OLS]) and dynamic (i.e., Lower Quarter Y Balance test [YBT-LQ]) balance were tested before and after the intervention period.",
        "The adherence rate to exercise was 98% for the participants of the intervention group. Significant test \u00d7\u00a0group interactions in favor of the intervention group were detected in three out of four OLS stance conditions and for all YBT-LQ reach directions.",
        "Eight weeks of balance exercises while tooth brushing proved to be feasible (i.e., high adherence rate) and effective (i.e., enhanced static and dynamic balance performance) and is thus recommended to improve postural control in healthy children."
