        "To compare the effects of calisthenic and cycle exercises with no exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.",
        "Forty-seven participants were allocated to either a cycle or calisthenic exercise or control group. Outcome measures, including Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, pulmonary functions, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Fitness Testing, and Hospital Anxiety-Depression, Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea, Fatigue Severity, Fatigue Impact Scales, were performed before and after the intervention.",
        "The change in VE/VCO2 significantly differed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) between two exercise groups. Physical fitness, quality of life, anxiety-depression, dyspnea and fatigue changed significantly in exercise groups, with no between-group differences. There were no significant improvements in control group.",
        "Calisthenics are as safe and effective as cycle exercise and could be included in comprehensive treatment programs."
