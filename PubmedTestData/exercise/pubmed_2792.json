        "Little is known about the type and intensity of physical activity (PA) reported by cardiac patients during the first year after hospitalization and whether patients are meeting recommended PA guidelines. In addition, the achievement of PA guideline over the course of recovery is largely unknown.",
        "A total of 136 patients consecutively admitted to 2 Australian hospitals after acute myocardial infarction (31%), or to undergo bypass surgery (29%) or percutaneous coronary intervention (40%), were interviewed at 6 weeks and at 4 and 12 months after admission. Physical activity at each time point was assessed by the Active Australia PA Survey. Medical and sociodemographic data, self-reported anxiety and depression, and cardiac rehabilitation attendance status were also recorded. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of PA guideline attainment at each of the 3 time points.",
        "At all 3 time points, walking was regularly performed by more than 95% of patients, while moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA reached only 40% and 59% participation by 12 months, respectively. Significant predictors of PA guideline attainment at 6 weeks posthospitalization were physical functioning, depression, and mode of PA. As hypothesized, different predictors were found at 4 months (living arrangements, PA mode, and attainment of 6-week PA guidelines) and 12 months (living arrangements, socioeconomic resources, PA mode, and attainment of 6-week PA guidelines).",
        "The study highlighted the potential importance of modifying walking behavior in cardiac patients to achieve PA guidelines and the dynamic nature of variables influencing PA at various stages of recovery."
