        "The aim of the study is to determine the effect of strength-based rehabilitation programs on patients who underwent partial meniscectomy procedures.",
        "Three databases MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase were searched from inception to May 9, 2022. Data on functional outcomes such as quadriceps and hamstring strengths, as well as patient-reported outcomes such as Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score and visual analog scale were recorded.",
        "A total of nine studies comprising 417 patients were included in this review. There were no significant differences in quadriceps or hamstring strength measures between preinterventation and postintervention for both groups. Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Scores significantly increased from preintervention and postintervention in both control and exercise groups. Visual analog scale scores changed from 5.0 to 1.4 cm in the exercise arm and 3.1 to 1.9 cm in the control arm.",
        "Strength-based exercise programs for patients postpartial meniscectomy did not result in significantly different improvements in quadriceps or hamstring strength compared with control programs. However, strength-based exercise programs resulted in significantly higher Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Scores and a greater decrease in visual analog scale scores. Further studies, specifically well-designed systematic randomized controlled trials, are necessary to elucidate the specifics behind what type of exercises to use in addition to load progression and frequency of training."
