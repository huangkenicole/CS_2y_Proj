        "To date, there are no evidence-based recommendations for physical therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The reason is a low number of related clinical trials (CTs), restricted sample sizes and a high dropout rate. It may influence the profile of the participants, while the final results might not translate to the general ALS population.",
        "To analyze factors affecting the ALS patients' enrollment and retention to the study, and to describe a profile of participants as compared to the eligible group.",
        "A total of 104 ALS patients were offered participation in a CT of low-intensity exercises at home. Forty-six patients were recruited. Demographic and clinical data (El Escorial criteria, site of onset, diagnosis delay, disease duration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale - revised [ALSFRS-R], Medical Research Council [MRC], hand-held dynamometry) were analyzed every 3\u2009months.",
        "Male gender, younger age and a higher ALSFRS predicted enrollment, while male gender, higher ALSFRS-R and MRC predicted retention in the study. A long commute to the study site and a fast disease progression were the main reasons influencing both enrollment and retention. Despite a high dropout rate, study participants were representative for the general ALS population.",
        "The above demographic, clinical and logistic factors need to be considered when designing studies in ALS population."
