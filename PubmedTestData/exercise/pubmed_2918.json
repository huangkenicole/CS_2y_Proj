        "Physical exercise has been shown to be an effective, safe, and quite inexpensive method to reduce cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and is currently in the process of establishing its relevance for cancer specific morbidity and mortality. The aim of this systematic review was to focus on specific effects of resistance exercise (RE) in the adjuvant therapy and rehabilitation of prostate cancer patients (PCaPs) receiving or having received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).",
        "A systematic literature search focusing on relevant and peer-reviewed studies published between 1966 and September 2014, using PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases, was conducted.",
        "The majority of studies demonstrated RE as an effective and safe intervention to improve muscular strength and performance, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in PCaPs, while there is inconclusive evidence concerning cardiovascular performance, body composition, blood lipids, bone mineral density (BMD), and immune response.",
        "Existing evidence leads to the conclusion that RE seems to be a safe intervention in PCaPs with beneficial effects on physical performance capacity and QoL. Nevertheless, further research in this field is urgently needed to increase understanding of exercise interventions in PCaPs."
