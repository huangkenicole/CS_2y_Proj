        "The aim of the present study was to determine if exercise intensity impacts upon the psychosocial responses of breast and prostate cancer survivors to a rehabilitation program.",
        "Eighty-seven prostate and 72 breast cancer survivors participated in an 8-week exercise and supportive group psychotherapy intervention (n\u2009=\u200984) or control (n\u2009=\u200975) group. Intervention participants were randomized to low-to-moderate intensity exercise (LIG; n\u2009=\u200944; 60-65\u00a0% VO2peak, 50-65\u00a0% one repetition maximum (1RM)) or moderate-to-high intensity exercise (HIG; n\u2009=\u200940; 75-80\u00a0% VO2peak, 65-80\u00a0% 1RM) while controls continued usual care. Before and after the 8\u00a0weeks, all participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast or -Prostate to assess quality of life (QOL) and Behavioural Regulations of Exercise Version 2 for exercise motivation. Intervention participants also completed a follow-up assessment 4\u00a0months post-intervention.",
        "All three groups improved in QOL from baseline to post-intervention, with no significant differences. From post-intervention to follow-up, the LIG and HIG similarly maintained QOL scores. Between baseline and post-intervention, both intervention arms improved their motivation to exercise compared to the controls (p\u2009=\u20090.004). At the 4-month follow-up, the HIG had maintained their overall exercise motivation (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and both domains of intrinsic motivation (identified regulation, p\u2009=\u20090.047; intrinsic regulation, p\u2009=\u20090.007); however, the LIG had regressed.",
        "The structured intervention was successful at improving autonomous exercise motivation, regardless of exercise intensity. However, only those participants who had exercised at a higher intensity sustained their improvement. Intervention participation did not improve QOL more than controls.",
        "Higher-intensity exercise is more likely to result in more sustainable increases in motivation to exercise among cancer survivors."
