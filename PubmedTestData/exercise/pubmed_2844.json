        "Aerobic exercise has received increasing attention in the scientific literature as a component of management for individuals who sustain a concussion. Because exercise training has been reported to reduce symptoms and improve function for those experiencing persistent postconcussion symptoms, it represents a potentially useful and clinically pragmatic rehabilitation technique. However, the specific exercise parameters that best facilitate recovery from concussion remain poorly defined and unclear. This review will provide a summary of the current understanding of the role of subsymptom exercise to improve outcomes after a concussion and will describe the exercise parameters that appear to be important. The latter will take into account the three pillars of exercise dose-frequency, duration, and intensity-to examine what is currently known. In addition, we identify important gaps in our knowledge of exercise as a treatment for those who develop persistent symptoms of concussion."
