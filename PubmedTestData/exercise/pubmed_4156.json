        "The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of supervised and unsupervised functional level-based exercises program for elderly inpatients on physical activity, mobility, health-related quality of life and depression status.",
        "A single-blinded randomised controlled trial.",
        "Internal medicine service.",
        "Patients aged 65 years or older.",
        "A supervised functional level-based exercise program was applied to the intervention group by a physiotherapist, for 40 min 5 times a week during their hospitalisation. Patients in the control group were asked to perform an unsupervised functional level-based exercise program which was described by the physiotherapist during the first visit.",
        "Mobility, physical activity level and health-related quality of life were assessed at admission and discharge in both groups. Depression status was evaluated at admission and 3 months after discharge.",
        "Sociodemographic features between intervention group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200962) and control group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200962) were similar. The intervention group showed a higher increment in mobility, physical activity level and quality of life scores than the control group (<i>d</i>\u2009=\u20090.62, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05; <i>d</i>\u2009=\u20090.57, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05; <i>d</i>\u2009=\u20091.12, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05 respectively). Inpatients in the intervention group, depression scores were lower 3 months after discharge (<i>d</i>\u2009=\u20090.42, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The length of stay in the hospital was not different between the groups.",
        "A supervised functional level-based exercise program is more effective than an unsupervised functional level-based exercise program for mobility, physical activity, depression and quality of life in elderly inpatients. These positive contributions are seen within a short period like a 5 to 10 days stay in hospital.",
