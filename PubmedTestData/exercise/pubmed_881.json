        "Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, causing 29% of all female cancers and afflicting 14% of all female cancer-related deaths worldwide. It remains a significant clinical, psychological, and financial burden. Exercise has been suggested to reduce cancer recurrence and cancer-related mortality from research in the past decade. Recent American and European guidelines advise on exercise for breast cancer survivors, not only to improve quality of life and decrease fatigue, but also to aid in decreasing recurrence and improve breast cancer related mortality. Nonetheless, adherence to guidelines remains low, with lack of awareness and fatigue related to chemotherapy as the most common barriers. It remains to be elucidated whether a particular type of exercise, or whether group or individualized activity is most effective. The importance of exercise in avoiding recurrence and improving quality of life needs to be recognized and taken into account in the management of breast cancer survivors. Further patient awareness and education is essential towards this goal, and the role of group exercise should be further explored."
