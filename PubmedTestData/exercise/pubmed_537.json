        "We hypothesized that the additional activation of motor units (MU) and the elevation of metabolic energy turnover resulting from whole-body vibration (WBV) superimposed to high intensity resistance training on a smith machine persist after 6 weeks of training with progressively increasing loads and vibration frequencies.",
        "Two groups of healthy male subjects performed either 6 weeks of Resistive Vibration Exercise (RVE, squats and heel raises with WBV, n=13) or Resistive Exercise (RE using the same protocol, n=13). During the first (pre) and the last training session (post), we determined the oxygen uptake changes normalized to total training weight (\u2206V'O<sub>2</sub>/ttw) and the normalized MU activity from rectus femoris (squats) and gastrocnemius lateralis (heel raise) muscles filtered for vibration frequencies and harmonics (EMG/ttw).",
        "At pre measurement, RVE induced higher EMG/ttw (squats) than RE alone (group effect, P=0.006). At post measurement, EMG/ttw was reduced (time effects between P=0.087 and P<0.001 for both groups and exercises). At pre and post measurement, \u2206V'O<sub>2</sub>/ttw was higher during RVE than during RE (group effects between P=0.005 and P=0.099 for both exercises).",
        "RVE permanently elevated metabolic energy turnover, although the initially observed additional MU activity by RVE could not be preserved in the working musculature."
