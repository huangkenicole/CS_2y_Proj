        "We aimed to compare cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters, cardiac adaptations, and proportion of responders after different aerobic training programs amongst women and men with coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients with CHD were evaluated with a CPET and echocardiography before and after 3 months of aerobic exercise training. Peak oxygen uptake exercise training response was assessed according to the median peak oxygen uptake change for post- versus pretraining in the whole cohort (stratification non/low responders (NLR) vs. high-responders) and normalized for lean body mass (LBM). Eighty-three CHD patients were included (19 women, 64 men; 27 patients with interval, 19 with continuous, and 37 with combination exercises). Peak oxygen uptake, peak workload normalized for LBM, pulmonary variables (i.e., ventilation and oxygen uptake efficiency slope), and O<sub>2</sub> pulse were significantly lower in women versus men. These parameters improved similarly with training in both sexes (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There were no differences in the proportion of NLR among women and men with CHD (7/19 (37%) vs. 35/64 (55%), <i>p</i> = 0.1719). Left ventricular ejection fraction and mean peak early diastolic mitral annulus velocity improved similarly with training in both sexes (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Women and men with CHD have a similar exercise training response regarding key CPET and echocardiographic parameters. The proportion of responders is similar. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03414996, NCT02048696, NCT03443193. <b>Novelty:</b> Cardiopulmonary adaptations to exercise training are similar among CHD men and women. Proportion of peak oxygen uptake for non/low/high responders is similar in CHD men and women. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function improved similarly after exercise training in CHD men and women."
