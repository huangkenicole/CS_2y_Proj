        "To compare the therapy effects following the aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise training (AET\u2005+\u2005RET) and common care treatment for patients with breast cancer.",
        "Articles about the effects of AET\u2005+\u2005RET on the breast cancer patients in 4 online databases were searched. The differences of cardiopulmonary function, blood pressure, blood lipid, and body mass index between the AET\u2005+\u2005RET treatment and the usual care treatment were compared.",
        "Totally, 8 articles were involved into the meta-analysis. The qualities of the 8 articles were medium. The combination results showed that AET\u2005+\u2005RET increased the VO2peak (weighted mean difference (WMD)\u2005=\u20052.93\u2009mL/kg/min; 95% CI: 0.38, 5.49; P\u2005=\u2005.02) and VO2max (WMD\u2005=\u20056.98\u2009mL/kg/min; 95% CI: 2.04, 15.92; P\u2005=\u2005.01), demonstrating its improving effects in cardiopulmonary function. Moreover, the AET\u2005+\u2005RET decreased the TG (WMD\u2005=\u2005-57.95\u2009mg/dL; 95% CI: -112.25, -3.64; P\u2005=\u2005.04), demonstrating its improving effects in blood lipid. While or the HRpeak, RERpeak, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index, there are no significant differences between the AET\u2005+\u2005RET and usual care treatment (P\u2005<\u2005.05).",
        "Our results demonstrated that AET\u2005+\u2005RET can significantly improve the cardiopulmonary function and blood lipid for breast cancer patients."
