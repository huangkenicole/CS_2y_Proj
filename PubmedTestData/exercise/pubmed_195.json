        "Physicians and complementary alternative medicine (CAM) specialists are not formally educated/trained on the benefits of exercises for people living with epilepsy (PWE). This study was performed to develop a consensus-based knowledge items on the benefits of exercises for PWE that physicians and CAM specialists need to know.",
        "Knowledge items were collected after an extensive review of the scientific literature and from in-depth interviews with key contacts in the domain (6 primary healthcare providers, 4 neurologists, 4 exercise and medicine specialists, 4 CAM practitioners, 4 researchers who did studies on the benefits of exercise for PWE, and 4 PWE). Items collected were reviewed by 12 researchers who did studies on exercise for PWE. A Delphi technique was followed among a panel of 50 members to develop the consensus-based core list.",
        "The final consensus-based core list contained 64 items that were grouped into the following categories: 1) general items recommending exercise for PWE, 2) benefits of exercise on prevention of seizures, 3) benefits of exercise on antiepileptic therapy, 4) benefits of exercise in preventing comorbidities associated with epilepsy, 5) benefits of exercise in improving quality of life of PWE, and 6) psychosocial benefits of exercise for PWE.",
        "This consensus-based core list might guide educators, trainers, or authorities while designing educational or training courses to increase knowledge of physicians in primary healthcare and CAM specialists with regard to the benefits of exercise for PWE. Further investigations are needed to determine if such consensus-based core list might improve care and wellbeing of PWE."
