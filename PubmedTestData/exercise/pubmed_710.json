        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 12-wk. recreational exercise program on mood state of 55 sedentary elderly women, ages 60 to 75 years, as well to examine the minimal amount of weekly exercise needed to produce these changes. The variables comprising mood state were Positive Engagement, Revitalization, Tranquility, and Physical Exhaustion. Subjects were allocated to three exercise groups (n = 15 each) and one control group (n = 10). Exercise was performed for 45 min. three times, twice, or once a week by one group each. Subjects were pre- and posttested on the selected variables. Those who participated three times a week had significantly more positive mood profiles than nonexercisers and those who exercised once a week, but profiles for those who exercised three or two times a week were similar. It is concluded that the group's improvement in both positive and negative affect corresponded to the frequency of exercise in their program. However, participation at least two times a week is necessary for significant mood alterations. Findings are discussed in terms of improvements in design and measurement and the need to focus research on multiple components of fitness in relation to mood state in an elderly sample."
