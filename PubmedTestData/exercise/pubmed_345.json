        "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> It is not known if the intensity in which exergames are performed can change gait parameters at different walking speeds. This study was designed to determine if a training program based on exergame exercises performed at different intensities (moderate vs. vigorous) influences walking speed and gait parameters in older adult women. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> After applying the inclusion criteria, 20 participants (69.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4 years) were randomized into two groups: moderate (11-13 perceived exertion) and vigorous (14-16 perceived exertion). Walking speed and gait parameters at self-selected walking speed (SSWS) and maximal walking speed (MWS) were evaluated before and after 3 months of exergame training. The walking speed and gait parameters were measured with an instrumented walkway. The walking speed reserve (WSR) was calculated as a difference and ratio. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There was pre-to-post effect of walking speed at self-selected walking pace (pre\u2009=\u2009112.1\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4\u2009cm.s<sup>-1</sup>; post\u2009=\u2009124.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4\u2009cm.s<sup>-1</sup>), in WSR calculated as ratio (pre\u2009=\u20091.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08; post\u2009=\u20091.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09), in a number of gait parameters at SSWS (step length, stride length, stride velocity, step time, stride time, swing time, stance time, single support, double support, gait cycle time, and cadence) and at MWS (step time, stride time, swing time, single support, double support, gait cycle time, and cadence). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Irrespective of the exercise intensity, exergame training improved walking speed only at a self-selected walking pace and some gait parameters at self-selected and MWS in older women."
