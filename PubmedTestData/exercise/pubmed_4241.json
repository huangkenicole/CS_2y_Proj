        "Long-lasting effects of COVID-19 may include cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal muscle, metabolic, psychological disorders and persistent symptoms that can impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated the effects of a home-based exercise training (HBET) programme on HRQoL and health-related outcomes in survivors of severe/critical COVID-19.",
        "This was a single-centre, single-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Fifty survivors of severe/critical COVID-19 (5\u00b11 months after intensive care unit discharge) were randomly allocated (1:1) to either a 3 times a week (~60-80\u2009min/session), semi-supervised, individualised, HBET programme or standard of care (CONTROL). Changes in HRQoL were evaluated through the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and physical component summary was predetermined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, functional capacity, body composition and persistent symptoms. Assessments were performed at baseline and after 16 weeks of intervention. Statistical analysis followed intention-to-treat principles.",
        "After the intervention, HBET showed greater HRQoL score than CONTROL in the physical component summary (estimated mean difference, EMD: 16.8 points; 95%\u2009CI 5.8 to 27.9; effect size, ES: 0.74), physical functioning (EMD: 22.5 points, 95%\u2009CI 6.1 to 42.9, ES: 0.83), general health (EMD: 17.4 points, 95%\u2009CI 1.8 to 33.1, ES: 0.73) and vitality (EMD: 15.1 points, 95%\u2009CI 0.2 to 30.1, ES: 0.49) domains. 30-second sit-to-stand (EMD: 2.38 reps, 95%\u2009CI 0.01 to 4.76, ES: 0.86), and muscle weakness and myalgia were also improved in HBET compared with CONTROL (p<0.05). No significant differences were seen in the remaining variables. There were no adverse events.",
