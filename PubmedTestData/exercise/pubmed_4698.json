        "Latinas report low levels of physical activity (PA) and high rates of related diseases. Existing evidence-based interventions for Latinas may need additional enhancements to help this population meet national PA guidelines. Enhancements could both increase the effectiveness and the costs of PA interventions. It is thus important to consider the costs and benefits of the different versions of these interventions, as these may influence whether the interventions are adopted and sustained on a larger scale in the future. This study describes the costs of two versions of a PA intervention (an original and a technology-enhanced version) and examines their cost effectiveness in helping sedentary Latina participants reach national PA guidelines. At the beginning of the study, none of the participants were meeting PA guidelines. More participants in the Enhanced intervention, compared to the Original intervention, were meeting guidelines both at 6 months (57% vs. 44%) and 12 months (46% vs. 36%). Costs were also higher for the Enhanced Intervention both at 6 and 12 months. Each additional person meeting guidelines in the Enhanced (vs. Original) group cost $87 at 6 months and $317 at 12 months. Given potential cost savings in medical care associated with meeting PA guidelines, these interventions could ultimately save money in addition to promoting health."

        "Latinas report low levels of physical activity (PA) and disproportionate risk of lifestyle-related diseases. Enhancements to evidence-based PA interventions may increase efficacy; however, uptake of interventions will likely depend on costs. To describe costs and examine the cost-effectiveness of two interventions for helping Latinas reach national aerobic PA guidelines. Adult Latinas (N = 199) were randomly assigned to an Original theory-based mail-delivered intervention or an Enhanced version with texting and additional calls and materials. Meeting PA guidelines was measured by the 7-Day PA Recall interview at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Intervention costs were estimated from a payer perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the additional cost per participant meeting guidelines in the Enhanced versus Original intervention. At baseline, no participants met guidelines. After 6 months, 57% and 44% in the Enhanced and Original arms met guidelines, respectively; at 12 months, rates fell to 46% and 36%. Cost per person of the Enhanced and Original interventions were $184 and $173 at 6 months, respectively, and $234 and $203 at 12 months. The primary additional expense in the Enhanced arm was staff time. ICERs were $87 per additional person meeting guidelines at 6 months (per sensitivity analysis, $26 if delivered by volunteers and $114 by medical assistants), and $317 at 12 months (sensitivity analysis: $57 and $434). Incremental costs per person meeting guidelines in the Enhanced arm were modest and could be warranted given the potential health benefits of meeting PA guidelines."
