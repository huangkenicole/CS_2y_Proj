        "Some studies have shown the effects of exercise training in retarding onset and progression of memory deficit in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In this research, we investigated the effect of treadmill running on memory function; before, after, and continually (before and after) the nucleus basalis magnocellularis lesions. 66 male rats were randomly divided into six groups, including control, sham operation, the NBM-lesion, exercise before the NBM-lesion, exercise after the NBM-lesion, and exercise before and after the NBM-lesion. Lesion was induced by 5\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl bilateral injection of Ibotenic acid. Memory function was assessed by using the passive avoidance learning test. Our results showed that treadmill running delays cognitive decline in the NBM-lesion rats, prevented memory deficit, and has advantageous effects on short-term, intermediate and long-term memory. Exercising on a regular basis may impede memory loss significantly, which may be attributed to specific molecular pathways in the brain."
