      "AbstractText": [
        "There is some evidence that high-load lumbar stabilization exercises, such as back bridge, can recruit both local and global muscles.",
        "Therapeutic exercises would optimize gluteus maximus (GMax), gluteus medius (GMed), multifidus (MF), and transversus abdominis (TrA) activation, while minimizing the activation of the tensor fascia latae (TFL) and erector spinae (ES) muscles in healthy individuals.",
        "Cross-sectional study.",
        "Research laboratory.",
        "Level 4.",
        "In this cross-sectional study, surface electromyography (EMG) of GMax, GMed, TFL, TrA, MF, and ES was used to quantify the gluteal-to-TFL muscle activation (GTA) index and a ratio of local to global (L/G) lumbar muscles during (1) the elbow-toe exercise in the prone position, (2) the elbow-toe with right left lifted, (3) the hand-knee with left arm and right leg lifted, (4) the back bridge, (5) the back bridge with right leg lifted, (6) the back bridge with left leg lifted, (7) the side bridge with left leg lifted, (8) the side bridge with right leg lifted, and (9) the elbow-toe with right leg horizontally lifted exercises in healthy individuals (20 men, 20 women; age, 25 \u00b1 4 years).",
        "The back bridge exercise with left leg lift generated the highest L/G muscles activity ratio (L/G = 3.35) while the hand-knee exercise yielded the lowest L/G muscles activity ratio (L/G = 1.21). The side bridge exercise with left elbow and foot and lifting the right leg (GTA = 63.78), hand-knee exercise (GTA = 49.62), back bridge (GTA = 28.05), and elbow-toe exercise with left leg horizontally lifted (GTA = 23.02) generated the highest GTA indices, respectively. Meanwhile, the normalized EMG amplitude for GMax was significantly less than the TFL, for elbow-toe exercise (<i>P</i> < 0.001), back bridge with left leg lift (<i>P</i> = 0.001), side bridge exercise with the right elbow and foot and lifting the left leg (<i>P</i> = 0.002), and elbow-toe exercise with right leg horizontally lifted (<i>P</i> < 0.001).",
        "The highest GTA indexes were observed during (1) the side bridge lifting the dominant leg and (2) the hand-knee horizontally lifting dominant leg, respectively. The L/G ratio was highest during (1) the back bridge lifting nondominant leg, (2) back bridge, and (3) back bridge lifting dominant leg, respectively. This study supports the use of back bridge exercises to strengthen the MF and side bridges to improve gluteal muscle activation.",
        "The highest GTA index was observed in the side bridge lifting the right leg. Highest L/G ratio was in the back bridge with nondominant leg lifted. This study supports the use of back bridge exercises to strengthen the MF. This study supports the use of side bridges to improve gluteal muscle activation."
