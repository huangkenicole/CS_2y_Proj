        "Migraine is a highly disabling condition and pharmacological treatment is the gold standard. However, several patients have also positive responses to the application of different manual techniques and therapeutic exercises in terms of reducing the intensity and frequency of migraine attacks. Nevertheless, the effects of a neck-specific exercise program have not yet been evaluated in these patients.",
        "To determine the effectiveness of a neck-specific exercise program in reducing the intensity and frequency of migraine attacks as compared to a sham ultrasound group.",
        "A two-armed, parallel-groups randomized controlled trial with 3\u2009months of follow-up will be conducted. 42 individuals, both genders, aged between 18 and 55\u2009years old with a medical diagnosis of migraine will be included. The intervention group will perform a protocol consisting of exercises for strengthening the muscles of the cervical spine. Participants within the sham ultrasound group will receive detuned ultrasound therapy in the upper trapezius muscle. Both groups will receive a weekly session for 8\u2009weeks. The efficacy of each intervention will be measured by the frequency and intensity of migraine at a 3-months follow-up.",
        "This study was registered under access code RBT-8gfv5j in the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Cl\u00ednicos (ReBEC) in November 28, 2016.",
        "This study will aim to determine the efficacy of a neck-specific exercise program in reducing the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks. If the results show that a neck-specific exercise program is effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks, therapists will have a low cost and easily applicable tool to treat migraine."
