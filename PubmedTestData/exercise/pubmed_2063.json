        "The objective of this article is to review the literature regarding the effectiveness and safety of Nordic walking (NW) in therapeutic rehabilitation in patients of an advanced age.",
        "Randomized studies comparing NW with different patterns of long-lasting physical rehabilitation in older adults (average age 65\u00a0years) were selected for the review. Studies were identified through a Medline database search covering the last 21\u00a0years.",
        "Seventy-four studies on this subject were identified, 37 of them fulfilled the required criteria and 27 of these were analyzed in this review.",
        "Nordic walking provides a safe and effective way to enhance physical activity in the elderly. It could also serve as a method of rehabilitation that improves fitness, the performance and the exercise capacity of aged persons with diseases associated with an advanced age: cardiovascular diseases due to atherosclerosis; metabolic syndrome without diabetes; early stage Parkinson's disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lowering depression in women with Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome."
