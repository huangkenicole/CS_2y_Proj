        "Few studies have simultaneously explored the training effects of exergame and video game. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exergame and video game training on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults. Eighty-four healthy older adults were randomly assigned to exergame training group, video game training group, and control group. Cognitive and physical function was measured before and after the training. Both training groups improved in verbal memory and aerobic endurance, but the training effects were greater in the exergame training group. The exergame training group also showed significant improvement in lower limb strength and balance. The current study provides evidence that exergame training, incorporating both cognitive engagement and physical activity, exerts greater benefits than cognitively engaging video game training alone. The findings shed lights into the future use of exergame in preventing cognitive and physical function decline in older adults."
