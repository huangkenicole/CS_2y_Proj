        "Decline in dual-task walking performance is associated with increased risk of falls among older adults. The objective of this study is to determine whether 18 hr of participation in EnhanceFitness (EF), an evidence-based group exercise program, improves dual-task walking performance among community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-eight healthy, community-dwelling older adults were evaluated before participating in EF and after 18 hr of participation. Gait speed was evaluated under single task and dual tasks using the TUG (Timed Up and Go) and 1-min walk tests. Dual-task costs (DTC), the relative cost of dual-task performance compared to single-task performance, were calculated for both cognitive and motor tasks. Postural control and executive functions were evaluated as well. After 18 hr of EF, dual-task walking performance improved. Single-task performance improved as well as postural control and executive function. There was no significant change in DTC across all measurements, except for the cognitive task of the TUG."
