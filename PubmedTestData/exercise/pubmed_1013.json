        "Based on randomized controlled trials, exercise is an efficacious strategy to improve quality of life (QOL) among cancer survivors. However, the effectiveness of exercise programs to improve QOL in real-world settings is unknown, as are factors related to external validity. This hinders dissemination and scalability. This scoping review synthesized published research on community-based exercise programs for cancer survivors and reported on the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM).",
        "A systematic literature search identified community-based exercise programs for adult cancer survivors (1980-March 2018), that met the following inclusion criteria: at least one face-to-face exercise session, the primary aim of program evaluation (i.e., feasibility/effectiveness), and pre/post measure of QOL. Data were coded using the RE-AIM framework. The effect size was calculated for overall QOL.",
        "Electronic database search yielded 553 articles; 31 studies describing unique programs were included for review. All studies described at least one element of implementation and most (80.6%) reported a significant (p\u2009<\u2009.05) improvement in at least one subscale, or total QOL. Few studies reported on indicators of reach (16.1%), adoption (6.5%), individual (16.1%), or system-level maintenance (32.3%).",
        "Community-based exercise programs are effective for improving QOL in adult cancer survivors. Recommendations are provided to improve reporting across RE-AIM dimensions, which is an important step to enhance the scalability of programs and thus, the potential for exercise to be fully integrated into system-level standard care for cancer survivors.",
        "Community-based exercise programs are a resource to improve QOL for adult cancer survivors."
