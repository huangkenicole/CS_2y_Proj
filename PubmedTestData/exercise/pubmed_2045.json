        "There is limited evidence on the neural strategies employed by the central nervous system to control muscle force in the presence of non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy (NIAT). Additionally, the neuromuscular mechanisms by which exercise may help to resolve tendon pain remain unclear.",
        "This study aims to first establish changes in the gastrocnemius-soleus motor unit firing properties after applying a training protocol of 6\u2009weeks based on either controlled eccentric or concentric contractions in individuals with NIAT. Second, we want to determine changes in the level of pain and function and mechanical and structural properties of the Achilles tendon after applying the same training protocol. Additionally, we want to compare these variables at baseline between individuals with NIAT and asymptomatic controls.",
        "A total of 26 individuals with chronic (>3 months) NIAT and 13 healthy controls will participate in the study. Individuals with NIAT will be randomised to perform eccentric or concentric training for 6 weeks. Motor unit firing properties of the medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius and soleus muscles will be assessed using high-density surface electromyography, as well as Achilles tendon length, cross-sectional area, thickness and stiffness using B-mode ultrasonography and shear wave elastography. Moreover, participants will complete a battery of questionnaires to document their level of pain and function.",
        "Ethical approval (ERN-20-0604A) for the study was obtained from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Ethical Review Committee of the University of Birmingham. The results of the study will be published in peer-review journals.",
