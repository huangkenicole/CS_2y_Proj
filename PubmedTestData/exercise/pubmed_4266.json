        "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease commonly occurring in middle-aged and elderly people. The main clinical manifestations are joint pain, limited activity, and decreased muscle strength resulting in decreased motor control ability. Exercise therapy is an effective method to enhance muscle strength of lower limbs, while China's traditional skill Tai Chi (TC) is a combination of activity and inertia, internal and external exercise therapy. In recent years, scholars at home and abroad have found that regular TC can effectively improve patients' lower limb function and balance ability. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of TC on lower limb function and balance ability in patients with KOA.",
        "This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. One hundred forty-six cases of KOA patients will be randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to 1:1 ratio, 73 cases in each group, the control group: sodium hyaluronate; experimental group: TC added on the basis of the control group. Both groups will receive standard treatment for 5\u200aweeks and will be followed up for 3\u200amonths. Observation indicators include: the western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; hospital for special surgery knee score; balance stability index, liver and kidney function, adverse reaction rate, etc. SPSS 23.0 software will be used for data analysis.",
        "This study will evaluate the effects of TC on lower limb function and balance ability of patients with KOA. The results of this trial will provide a clinical basis for the selection of exercise therapy for patients with KOA."
