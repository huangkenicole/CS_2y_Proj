        "This case report highlights the functional and quality-of-life outcomes of an 8-week treadmill training program for an 18-month old child with Williams syndrome who is not walking.",
        "The child had clinical improvements in gross motor function and quality of life as determined by the Gross Motor Function Measure and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory after 8 weeks of treadmill training as an outpatient.",
        "Treadmill training is clinically feasible and effective for this child with Williams syndrome. Further research is necessary for generalizability. Treadmill training should be considered when developing a plan of care for children with Williams syndrome who are not walking or children with similar deficits."
