        "In contrast to standard bicycle exercise with moderate or submaximal effort, low-effort exercises were employed by the author who studied their effect on cardiovascular system of stage II hypertension patients. They were males (n-126) aged 47.2 +/- 3.6 with the disease history of 8.4 +/- 1-9 years. Associated coronary heart disease was diagnosed in 82% of the patients. The test subjects were divided randomly into three groups: group 1 patients received drugs only, group 2 received drugs and exercised walking, group 3 received drugs and exercised on bicycle ergometer in the nonstrenuous regimen. It was found that exercise tolerance of the patients was different and depended on the hemodynamic type. Hypokinetic circulation patients showed the lowest exercise tolerance. Low-effort bicycle exercise in addition to drugs is indicated for hyper- and eukinetic circulation patients. Walking is inferior to the bicycle exercise and can be recommended as a variety of nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension stage II. The combined effect of walking and chemotherapy produced the rise in cardiac capacity in the absence of the adequate increment in coronary blood flow, whereas bicycle exercise seems to enhance cardiac coronary circulation in hypertensive subjects."
