        "To explore the clinician experience of the feasibility of a supervised, exercise-based rehabilitation program co-located within a cancer treatment unit.",
        "A qualitative study using individual semi-structured interviews was completed. Fifteen clinicians were purposively sampled from a cancer unit at a tertiary hospital where a new, exercise-based rehabilitation program was implemented. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded independently by two reviewers and analysed by thematic analysis.",
        "The main theme was, 'a co-located cancer rehabilitation program was perceived to initiate a cultural change'. A positive culture for exercise-based rehabilitation was demonstrated by consistent, positive messaging about exercise from a broad range of hospital staff. The culture shift was facilitated by the program being convenient for patients and staff, being visible, and by rapport building all within the context of filling a service gap.",
        "This study identified key practical elements in initiating a positive culture around exercise-based rehabilitation within a cancer unit. These data may inform future implementation of rehabilitation programs to improve access to exercise for cancer survivors."
