      "AbstractText": [
        "Peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak) is severely worsened after disabling stroke, having serious implications for function, metabolism, and ongoing cardiovascular risk. Work from our laboratory and others has previously shown that modest improvements in VO2 peak are possible in stroke participants with aerobic exercise training. The purpose of the current investigation was to test the extent to which greater enhancements in VO2 peak after stroke are possible using a treadmill protocol with far greater emphasis on intensity progression compared with a protocol without such emphasis.",
        "Using a randomized design, we compared stroke survivors engaged in higher intensity treadmill training (HI-TM, 80% heart rate reserve [HRR]) with those undergoing lower intensity treadmill training (LO-TM, 50% HRR). Measured outcomes were change in VO2 peak, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), 30-ft walk times (30WT), and 48-hour step counts (48SC). LO-TM participants trained for a longer period of time per session in an effort to approximately match workload/caloric expenditure. Participants were randomized with stratification according to age and baseline walking capacity.",
        "HI-TM participants (n = 18) had significantly greater gains in VO2 peak (+34%) than LO-TM participants (n = 16; +5%) across the 6-month intervention period (P = .001, group \u00d7 time interaction). Conversely, there was no statistical difference between groups in the changes observed for 6MWD, 30WT, or 48SC.",
        "HI-TM is far more effective than LO-TM for improving VO2 peak after disabling stroke. The magnitude of relative improvement for HI-TM was double compared with previous reports from our laboratory with probable clinical significance for this population."
