        "Physical activity (PA) is a key health behavior in people with stroke including risk reduction of recurrent stroke. Despite the beneficial effects of PA, many community-dwelling stroke survivors are physically inactive. Information and communication technologies are emerging as a possible method to promote adherence to PA.",
        "The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) App in improving levels of PA.",
        "Forty-one chronic stroke survivors were randomized into an intervention group (IG) n=24 and a control group (CG) n=17. Participants in the IG were engaged in the Multimodal Rehabilitation Program (MMRP) that consisted on supervising adherence to PA through a mHealth app, participating in an 8-week rehabilitation program that included: aerobic, task-oriented, balance and stretching exercises. Participants also performed an ambulation program at home. The CG received a conventional rehabilitation program. Outcome variables were: adherence to PA, (walking and sitting time/day), walking speed (10MWT); walking endurance (6MWT); risk of falling (TUG); ADLs (Barthel); QoL (Eq-5D5L) and participant's satisfaction.",
        "At the end of the intervention, community ambulation increased more in IG (38.95 min; SD: 20.37) than in the CG (9.47 min; SD: 12.11) (p\u2264.05). Sitting time was reduced by 2.96 (SD 2.0) hours/day in the IG and by 0.53 (SD 0.24) hours in the CG (p\u2264.05).",
        "The results suggest that mHealth technology provides a novel way to promote adherence to home exercise programs post stroke. However, frequent support and guidance of caregiver is required to ensure the use of mobile devices."
