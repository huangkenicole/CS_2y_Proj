        "The aim: To investigate and analyse certain aspects of potential adherence to rehabilitation treatment of patients with musculoskeletal injuries.",
        "Materials and methods: The study was conducted among 108 patients with musculoskeletal injuries. A questionnaire, containing 25 questions, was used to determine the importance for patients of rehabilitation treatment and their readiness to perform its measures.",
        "Results: It was found that for 98.0 \u00b1 2.6% of surveyed patients with injuries it is important not to experience limitations in the future functioning of their bodies. 97.2 \u00b1 3.1% of the surveyed patients with injuries indicated their readiness to do exercises prescribed by a rehabilitation specialist at home, and 87.0 \u00b1 6.3% were ready to perform physical exercises even in case of unpleasant sensations or discomfort. It was determined that 67.6 \u00b1 8.8% of the surveyed patients with injuries are ready to attend rehabilitation classes with specialists, 69.5 \u00b1 8.7% are ready to record their own achievements at home and 73.1 \u00b1 8.4% of the patients consent to maintain regular contact with rehabilitation specialists via the Internet.",
        "Conclusions: Patients with musculoskeletal injuries have a high level of understanding of the importance of rehabilitation. The vast majority of them are ready to perform most of the components of rehabilitation, but without significant changes in normal life and with a predominant stay at home. All this requires the development of organizational measures to form the adherence to particular components of rehabilitation."
