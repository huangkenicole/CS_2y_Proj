        "Exercise brings many benefits to patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), but the effect of combined aerobic and resistance exercise remains unclear. English and Chinese databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, Wan Fang, and CBM) were searched from inception to January 2023 to retrieve qualified randomized controlled trials. The literature selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment of included studies were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 23 studies with 1214 participants were included, and 17 of the interventions were conducted during dialysis. Results showed that combined aerobic and resistance exercise (CARE) improved the peak oxygen uptake, six-minute walking test, 60\u2009s sit-to-stand test (STS), 30\u2009s STS, dialysis adequacy, five (out of eight) domains and physical component summary of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, blood pressure, and hemoglobin for MHD patients compared with usual care. No significant changes were found in the mental component summary of HRQOL, C-reactive protein, creatinine, potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate. Subgroup analysis showed that intradialytic CARE ameliorated more outcomes, except for handgrip strength and hemoglobin, than non-intradialytic ones. CARE is an effective way to improve physical function, aerobic capacity, dialysis adequacy, and HRQOL for MHD patients. Strategies should be implemented by clinicians and policymakers to motivate patients to do more exercise. Well-designed clinical trials are warranted to explore the effectiveness of non-intradialytic CARE."
