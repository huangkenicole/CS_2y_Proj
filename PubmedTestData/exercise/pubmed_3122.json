        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise intensity on the body composition of obese subjects during severe caloric restriction. Forty obese subjects (33 women, 7 men; 41 +/- 7.7 years; 106 +/- 26kg; body fat > 25% men, > 30% women) on a commercially prepared OPTIFAST 420kcal/day supplemented fast were randomized into groups that exercised at target heart rates corresponding to 40% and 60% of the heart rate reserve (HRR) at the start of the program. Training volume was similar for both groups at approximately 300kcal per session three times per week for 12 weeks. Body weight, body fat, and lean weight were similar for both exercise intensity groups at week one. Overall, body weight decreased by 15.3 +/- 6.7 kg (p < or = .05), and body fat decreased by 14.9 +/- 5.0 kg (p < or = .05) for the 40 subjects, whereas lean weight remained unchanged. No significant differences in body weight, body fat, or lean weight were observed between the two groups. The results of the current study indicated that while on a supplemented 420-kcal/day fast, exercise at 40% and 60% of the HRR affected body composition similarly when total training volume was held constant at 900kcal/week. Lean weight remained unchanged and accompanied a 14.9 +/- 5.0-kg decrease in body fat, which may have resulted when the volume of exercise (ie, 900kcals/wk) was factored into the exercise prescriptions. These results suggest that exercising at 60% of the HRR offers no advantages for body composition changes over those obtained from exercising at 40% of HRR when the total volume of exercise training is controlled."
