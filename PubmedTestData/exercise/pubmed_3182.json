        "Dysfunction of the endothelium is a key precursor of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial function, as assessed via the flow-mediated dilation test, is attenuated with chronic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension). Exercise training may mitigate this dysfunction and promote better vascular health.",
        "The main objective of this umbrella review was to determine the impact of exercise training on flow-mediated dilation in healthy adults and those with chronic disease.",
        "Studies were included if they conducted a systematic review and/or meta-analysis on flow-mediated dilation responses to exercise interventions in adults. Sources were searched in January 2022 and included Scopus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Academic Search Premier. National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used. The results were presented narratively.",
        "Twenty-seven systematic reviews, including 19 meta-analyses, (total: 5464 unique participants, 2181 reported unique female individuals) met the inclusion criteria. The average overall quality of included reviews was 8.8/11. The quality of studies within each included review varied from low to moderate using a variety of quality assessment scales. Reviews were conducted in healthy adults (n\u2009=\u20099, meta-analyses\u2009=\u20096), as well as those with type 2 diabetes (n\u2009=\u20095, meta-analyses\u2009=\u20094), cardiovascular conditions [i.e., conditions that impact the cardiovascular system, but excluding samples of only type 2 diabetes] (n\u2009=\u200911, meta-analyses\u2009=\u20097), and other chronic conditions (n\u2009=\u20092, meta-analyses\u2009=\u20092). Overall, the included reviews provided evidence that the type of training to optimally improve FMD may vary based on disease condition. Specifically, the evidence suggests that healthy adults benefitted most from higher intensity aerobic training and/or more frequent low-to-moderate resistance training. In addition, adults with type 2 diabetes benefitted most from low-intensity resistance or aerobic exercise training, whereas those with cardiovascular conditions should consider engaging in high-intensity aerobic training to improve endothelial function.",
        "This information may help guide the design of specific exercise programs or recommendations for adults with chronic conditions."
