        "The clinical effects of osteoporosis include pain, fractures, and physical disability, causing a loss of independence and necessitating long-term care. Whereas the effects of exercise therapy in decreasing body mass index and preventing fractures are well established, there is no consensus on back pain and quality of life in women with osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a brief course of rehabilitation, comprising group-adapted physical exercises, with regard to back pain, disability, and quality of life in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who had no evidence of fractures.",
        "The enrolled patients were randomized into two groups: the treatment group underwent ten sessions of rehabilitative exercises, and the control group received an instructional booklet with descriptions and figures of exercises that were to be performed at home.",
        "Sixty patients completed the trial and assessments, including a 6-month follow-up. The treatment was effective versus the control group, significantly improving pain (Visual Analogue Scale: p < 0.001 at the end of the treatment and at the follow-up; McGill Pain Questionnaire: p = 0.018 at the follow-up), disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire: p < 0.001 at the end and follow-up), and quality of life (Shortened Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire: p = 0.021 at the end of treatment; p = 0.005 at follow-up).",
        "Our results suggest that group rehabilitation reduces back pain and improves functional status and quality of life in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, maintaining these outcomes for 6 months. The use of physical exercises might strengthen the habit to training."
