        "This study examined the effect of a morning priming session consisted of stretching, mobility, core and lower-body resistance, and reactive agility exercises on match performance in elite-level soccer players. Information on physical and technical performance was collected during competitive matches (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200932) and subsequently classified as those preceded or not preceded by a priming session. Results showed significantly increased (i) distance covered overall (Cohen's d (d)\u2009=\u20090.34, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.011), in moderate-intensity (d\u2009=\u20090.52, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001) and high-intensity running (d\u2009=\u20090.30, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.024), and (ii) frequency of duels (d\u2009=\u20090.26, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.050) in matches preceded by a priming session compared to those not preceded by a priming session. These findings show that players' physical performance was notably enhanced due to the pre-match routines that the team implemented on match day, while technical performance was in general similar irrespective of whether a priming session was implemented or not before the match. Therefore, morning priming session implemented on match day can be recommended as an effective pre-match strategy to increase players' physical performance in soccer without negative consequences on technical performance."
