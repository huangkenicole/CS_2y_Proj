        "Time-trial require cyclists to have an acute control on their sensory cues to regulate their pacing strategies. Pacing an effort accurately requires an individual to process sensory signals with efficacy, a factor that can be characterized by a high neural efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a cycling time-trial on neural efficiency in comparison to a low intensity endurance exercise, the latter supposedly not requiring high sensory control.",
        "On two separate days, 13 competitive cyclists performed a session comprising of two 10\u00a0min treadmill tests, performed at different intensity zones from 1 to 5 on the rating subjective exercise intensity scale. The tests were performed before and after both a time-trial and endurance cycling exercise. Electroencephalography activity was measured during each intensity zones of the treadmill exercises. Neural efficiency was then calculated for each intensity block using the \u03b1/\u03b2 electroencephalography activity ratio.",
        "The neural efficiency averaged on the 5 IZ decreased following the time-trial in the motor cortex (-\u200913\u2009\u00b1\u20098%) and prefrontal cortex (-\u200910\u2009\u00b1\u200912%), but not after the endurance exercise.",
        "To conclude, the time-trial impaired the neural efficiency and increasing the RPE of the cyclists in the severe intensity zone."
