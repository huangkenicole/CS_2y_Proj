      "AbstractText": [
        "Traditional exercise programs for older adults, which focus on aerobic and strength training, have had only modest effects on walking. Recently, a motor learning exercise program was shown to have greater effects on walking compared with a traditional exercise program. Translating this novel motor learning exercise program into a group exercise program would allow it to be offered as an evidence-based, community-based program for older adults.",
        "To translate a walking rehabilitation program based on motor learning theory from one-on-one to group delivery (On\u00a0the Move) and evaluate multiple aspects of implementation in older adults with impaired mobility.",
        "The translation process involved multiple iterations, including meetings of experts in the field (Phase I), focus groups (Phase II), and implementation of the newly developed program (Phase III). Phase III was based on a one-group model of intervention development for feasibility, safety, potential effects, and acceptability.",
        "Community sites, including 2 independent living facilities, an apartment building, and a community center.",
        "Adults 65 years of age or older who could ambulate independently and who were medically stable. Thirty-one adults, mean age 82.3 \u00b1 5.6 years, were eligible to participate.",
        "The group exercise program was held twice a week for 12 weeks.",
        "Acceptability of the program was determined by retention and adherence rates and a satisfaction survey. Risk was measured by adverse events and questions on perceived challenge and safety. Mobility was assessed pre- and postintervention by gait speed, Figure\u00a0of 8 Walk Test, and 6-minute walk test.",
        "Modifications to the program included adjustments to format/length, music, education, and group interaction. The 12-week program was completed by 24 of 31 entrants (77%). Adherence was high, with participants attending on average 83% of the classes. Safety was excellent, with only 1 subject experiencing a controlled, noninjurious fall. There was preliminary evidence for improved mobility after the intervention: gait speed improved from 0.76 \u00b1 0.21 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.22 m/s, P = .06; Figure\u00a0of 8 Walk Test from 13.0 \u00b1 3.9 to 12.0 \u00b1 3.9 seconds, P = .07; and 6-minute walk test from 246 \u00b1 75 to 281 \u00b1 67 m, P = .02.",
        "The group-based program was safe and acceptable to older adults with impaired mobility and resulted in potentially clinically meaningful improvements in mobility."
