      "AbstractText": [
        "Declines in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle mass are both associated with advancing age and each of these declines is associated with worse health outcomes. Resistance exercise training (RET) has previously been shown to improve muscle mass and function in the older population. If RET is also able to improve CRF, as it has been shown to do in younger populations, it has the potential to improve multiple health outcomes in the expanding older population.",
        "This systematic review aimed to identify the role of RET for improving CRF in healthy older adults. A search across CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and EMCARE databases was conducted with meta-analysis performed on eligible papers to identify improvements in established CRF parameters (VO2 peak, aerobic threshold (AT), 6-minute walking distance test (6MWT) following RET intervention. Main eligibility criteria included older adults (aged over 60), healthy cohorts (disease-specific cohorts were excluded) and RET intervention.",
        "Thirty-seven eligible studies were identified. Meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in VO2 peak (MD 1.89\u00a0ml/kg/min; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.57\u00a0ml/kg/min), AT (MD 1.27\u00a0ml/kg/min; 95% CI 0.44-2.09\u00a0ml/kg/min) and 6MWT (MD 30.89; 95% CI 26.7-35.08) in RET interventions less than 24\u00a0weeks. There was no difference in VO2 peak or 6MWT in interventions longer than 24\u00a0weeks.",
        "This systematic review adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the implementation of RET in the older population for improving whole-body health, particularly in time-limited timeframes."
