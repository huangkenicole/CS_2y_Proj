      "AbstractText": [
        "Physically active behavior has been associated with a reduced risk of developing certain types of cancer and improved psychological conditions for patients by reducing anxiety and depression, in turn improving the quality of life of cancer patients. On the other hand, the correlations between inactivity, sedentary behavior, and overweight and obesity with the risk of development and progression of various cancers are well studied, mainly in middle-aged and elderly subjects. In this article, we have revised the evidence on the effects of physical activity on the expression and release of the adipose-tissue-derived mediators of low-grade chronic inflammation, i.e., adipokines, as well as the adipokine-mediated impacts of physical activity on tumor development, growth, and metastasis. Importantly, exercise training may be effective in mitigating the side effects related to anti-cancer treatment, thereby underlining the importance of encouraging cancer patients to engage in moderate-intensity activities. However, the strong need to customize and adapt exercises to a patient's abilities is apparent. Besides the preventive effects of physically active behavior against the adipokine-stimulated cancer risk, it remains poorly understood how physical activity, through its actions as an adipokine, can actually influence the onset and development of metastases."
