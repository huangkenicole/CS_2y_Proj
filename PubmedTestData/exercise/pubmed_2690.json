        "This study investigated the acute post-exercise effect of high-velocity resistance exercise on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive older women. Fourteen volunteers (67.9\u00b15.1 years) performed a high-velocity resistance exercise session (8 exercises using Thera-Band, 3 sets of 6 repetitions as fast as possible in the concentric phase with moderate intensity) and a control session, separated by a 7-10-day period. Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored following 12-h post-sessions and compared between conditions at 1 to 4-h, 5 to 8-h, and 9 to 12-h. Average 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, awake, asleep periods, and blood pressure load were also analyzed. There was a condition by time interaction for systolic ambulatory blood pressure over 12-h post-sessions (P=0.043). It was observed a lower systolic ambulatory blood pressure in the first 4-h period following the high-velocity resistance exercise session compared to the control session (-6.7\u2009mmHg, 95% CI \u2009-\u200911.6 to -1.8\u2009mmHg; P=0.011). No changes were observed for diastolic ambulatory blood pressure over 12-h post-sessions as well as for the other variables analyzed (P>0.05). In summary, a single high-velocity resistance exercise session elicits a post-exercise antihypertensive effect and may be considered as a strategy to acutely improve blood pressure control in hypertensive older women."
