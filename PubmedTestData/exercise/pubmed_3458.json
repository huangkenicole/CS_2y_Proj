        "Exercise is significantly beneficial for patients with osteoporosis. However, physiological and psychological factors such as pain and kinesiophobia prevent patients from participating in exercise. Therefore, it is important to understand how these patients perceive participation in exercise. This qualitative study was conducted in China using conventional content analysis. Using a purposeful sampling method, 17 patients with primary osteoporosis were recruited. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview and managed using ATLAS.ti 21. Nine generic categories were developed from 26 subcategories and two main categories were identified: Barriers and facilitators, support systems, network resources, positive emotions, and reactions were the facilitators for exercise in this study. In addition, mindful exercise was positively viewed by the patients. Inefficient awareness, weak support systems, and burdens were identified as barriers. To improve compliance in clinical practice, targeted exercise protocols should be developed for patients based on these perceptions."
