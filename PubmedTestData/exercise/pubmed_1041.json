        "To investigate the effects of a supervised exercise training program on health parameters, physical capacity, and health-related quality of life in patients with mild and chronic juvenile dermatomyositis (DM).",
        "This was a prospective longitudinal study following 10 children with mild and chronic juvenile DM (disease duration >1 year). The exercise program consisted of twice-a-week aerobic and resistance training. At baseline and after the 12-week intervention, we assessed muscle strength and function, aerobic conditioning, body composition, juvenile DM scores, and health-related quality of life.",
        "Child self-report and parent proxy-report Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory scores were improved after the intervention (-40.3%; P = 0.001 and -48.2%; P = 0.049, respectively). Importantly, after exercise, the Disease Activity Score was reduced (-26.9%; P = 0.026) and the Childhood Muscle Assessment Scale was improved (+2.5%; P = 0.009), whereas the Manual Muscle Test presented a trend toward statistical significance (+2.2%; P = 0.081). The peak oxygen consumption and time-to-exhaustion were increased by 13.3% (P = 0.001) and 18.2% (P = 0.003), respectively, whereas resting heart rate was decreased by 14.7% (P = 0.006), indicating important cardiovascular adaptations to the exercise program. Upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle function were also significantly improved after the exercise training (P < 0.05). Both the whole-body and the lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density were significantly increased after training (1.44%; P = 0.044 and 2.85%; P = 0.008, respectively).",
        "We showed for the first time that a 12-week supervised exercise program is safe and can improve muscle strength and function, aerobic conditioning, bone mass, disease activity, and health-related quality of life in patients with active and nonactive mild and chronic juvenile DM with near normal physical function and quality of life."
