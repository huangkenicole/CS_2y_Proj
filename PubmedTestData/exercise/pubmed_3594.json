        "Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) undergo motor injuries, which decrease their quality of life (QL). Dance, added to drug therapy, can help treating these patients AIMS: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis with the aim to analyze the effects of dance classes in comparison to other interventions or to the absence of intervention, in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients METHODS: The search was conducted in MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO, Cochrane and PsycINFO (last searched in August 2017). RCTs analyzing dance effects in comparison to other physical training types or to no intervention, on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients were selected. The outcomes assessed were motor symptoms with Unified PD Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII), functional mobility with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), endurance with 6 min walking test (6MWT), freezing of gait with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG_Q), walking velocity with GAITRite and QL with PD Questionnaire (PDQ39). Two reviewers independently extracted methodological quality and studies data. Results are presented as weighted mean differences.",
        "Five RCTs were included, totaling 159 patients. Dance promoted significant improvements on UPDRSIII, and a decrease in TUG time when compared to other types of exercise. In comparison to the absence of intervention, dance practice also showed significant improvements in motor scores.",
        "Dance can improve motor parameters of the disease and patients' functional mobility."
