        "Recently, exergames have been widely applied as exercise platforms among older adults. However, studies on the influence of exergames on older adults' physical activity remain scarce. The review article highlights the potential benefit of exergames as a physical activity tool for older adults. The literature search followed the PRISMA guidelines on databases PubMed (Public/Publisher MEDLINE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Cochrane, and Scopus. The literature included studies that evaluated the influence of exergames on older adults' physical activity. Articles were excluded if the mixed intervention was used, emphasizing specific limbs, improving specific tasks, or not mentioning intervention. The review article identified 25 studies that reported on 855 older adults 55 years of age and older. In addition, the common exergaming technology platforms examined were Microsoft Kinect\u2122, Nintendo<sup>\u00ae</sup> Wii\u2122, cybercycling, and interactive video dance games. Meanwhile, 11 studies used a pretest/post-test design and randomized controlled trial design in 14 studies. The review found that exergames significantly impacted the older adults' physical activity level as participants experienced improved balance and cognitive function, and enjoyed playing exergame, thus prolonging their game engagement. Although research on exergames is still new, current evidence showed a significant potential benefit of exergames as a physical activity tool for older adults. To overcome the limitation on various parameters that showed different effects and outcomes of exergames, the study recommends implementing randomized controlled trials with long-term observation using a mixed-method approach. Moreover, a multidisciplinary method involving exercise and neuromotor control experts could determine potential mechanisms of action that benefited from the exercises."
