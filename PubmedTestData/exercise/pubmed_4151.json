        "Database searches were performed in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and LILACS on January 10th, 2023. We included: randomized and/or controlled clinical trials; physical exercise as an intervention; analysis of body composition and/or muscle function; and sarcopenic obesity diagnosis. We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool and PEDro scale. The GRADE certainty of evidence was also performed.",
        "Fourteen studies were included in the systematic review and nine studies in the meta-analysis. A decrease in body fat (%) favoring the exercise group was identified (SMD: -0.34 [95% CI: -0.53 to -0.16]; p=0.0003) (GRADE: \u2295\u2295\u2295\u25ef Moderate). Only resistance training showed fat reduction (SMD: -0.27 [95% CI: -0.48 to -0.06]; p=0.01). Increases in upper (SMD: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.04 to 0.78]; p=0.03) (GRADE: \u2295\u2295\u25ef\u25ef Low) and lower (SMD: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.22 to 1.39]; p=0.007) (GRADE: \u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295 High) limb strength was identified with exercise. Chair stand test showed increases with exercise (SMD: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.40 to 1.07]; p<0.0001) (GRADE: \u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295 High), especially for resistance training (SMD: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.21 to 1.02]; p=0.003) and combined training (SMD: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.40 to 1.57]; p=0.0005). The PEDro scale for the studies in our review ranged from 3 to 8 (mean = 5.8 (1.6)), meaning fair methodological quality, and most studies were overall judged with at least low/some concerns in terms of risk of bias.",
        "Overall, moderate to high certainty of evidence was found for body fat, lower limb strength, and chair stand test. On the other hand, low certainty of evidence was found for upper limb strength. Resistance, combined, and aerobic training evoked divergent results between the variables analyzed. Although promising, our results should be considered sparingly, but may guide additional exercise recommendations to improve specific health parameters in older adults with SO."
