        "This study aimed to promote exercise prehabilitation in patients with end-stage liver disease during their waiting period for liver transplantation.",
        "End-stage liver disease indirectly contributes to the development of sarcopenia and affects survival after liver transplantation because of low physiological reserves and insufficient aerobic capacity while awaiting transplantation. Exercise prehabilitation could reduce postoperative complications and promote postoperative recovery.",
        "Following the JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System, this study used six audit criteria derived from the JBI Evidence Summary. A baseline audit of six patients and nine nurses was conducted, analyzed barriers, established a prehabilitation process and improved interventions, followed by the implementation of exercise prehabilitation and follow-up audit.",
        "In the baseline audit, the results of the six criteria [(1) multimodal prehabilitation that includes exercise and other interventions where appropriate is offered to patients scheduled for abdominal surgery; (2) prior to the commencement of an exercise program an assessment of exercise contraindications, health status, treatments, physical activity level, functional capacity and quality of life is completed; (3) exercise programs are designed by appropriately qualified personnel; (4) exercise is delivered and supervised by appropriately qualified personnel; (5) exercise prescription is tailored to each individual patient; and (6) patient response to exercise is monitored throughout prehabilitation] were 0-22%. After implementing the best-practice strategies, all six criteria were set to 100%. Patients were aware of and had high compliance with exercise prehabilitation, nurses' and patients' knowledge of exercise rehabilitation improved, and nurses' implementation rate was significantly higher than before implementation ( P \u200a<\u200a0.05). The differences in the 6 min walking distance and Borg Fatigue Score between the preimplementation and postimplementation were statistically significant (all P \u200a<\u200a0.05).",
        "This best-practice implementation project is feasible. These results indicate that exercise prehabilitation could improve the preoperative walking capacity and fatigue of patients with end-stage liver disease. Ongoing best practices will be expected to develop in the future."
