        "Aerobic training (AT) has been the primary mode of exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation. Historically, the reason for the prescription of AT was that it was speculated that although RT may be beneficial for some clinical outcomes, it may have an adverse effect on ventricular structure and function. However, RT has now made its way into current cardiac rehabilitation guidelines, including those directed towards patients with HF, albeit differences exist across institutions and guidelines. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Trials Register on April 30, 2021, was conducted for exercise-based rehabilitation trials in HF. Randomised and controlled trials that reported on resistance training versus usual care or trials that directly compared RT to an AT intervention were included. Resistance training versus controls improves parameters of lower (SMD 0.76 (95%CI 0.26, 1.25, p\u2009=\u20090.003] and upper extremity muscle strength (SMD 0.85 (95%CI 0.35, 1.35), p\u2009=\u20090.0009], both key parameters of physical function throughout the lifespan. Importantly, RT in isolation, versus control, improves VO2peak [MD: 2.64\u00a0ml/kg/min (95%CI 1.67, 3.60), p\u2009<\u20090.00001] and 6MWD [MD: 49.94\u00a0m (95%CI 34.59, 65.29), p\u2009<\u20090.00001], without any detrimental effect on left ventricular parameters. Resistance training in HF patients is safe and improves parameters of physical function and quality of life. Where people with HF are unable to, or are not inclined to, partake in aerobic activity, RT alone is appropriate to elicit meaningful benefit."
