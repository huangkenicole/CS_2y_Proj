        "Many older adults live with the combination of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) and frailty and are at increased risk of a deterioration in health requiring interaction with healthcare services. Low skeletal muscle strength is observed in individuals living with MLTC and is central to physical frailty. Resistance exercise (RE) is the best available treatment for improving muscle strength, but little is known about the attitudes and barriers to RE in this group of older adults. This study therefore aimed to explore the knowledge of and attitudes towards RE, as well as the barriers and enabling factors, in older adults living with MLTC, frailty and a recent deterioration in health.",
        "Fourteen participants aged 69-92 years (10 women) from the Lifestyle in Later Life - Older People's Medicine (LiLL-OPM) study were recruited from an Older People's Medicine Day Unit in Newcastle, UK. Participants were invited to take part in a semi-structured interview exploring their knowledge and attitudes as well as barriers and enabling factors to RE. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.",
        "The analysis generated three themes (1) a lack of awareness and understanding of RE, (2) a self-perceived inability to perform RE; physical and psychological barriers and (3) willingness to perform RE under expert guidance. There was a general lack of awareness and understanding of RE, with most participants having never heard of the term and being unaware of its potential benefits. When RE was described, participants stated that they would be willing to try RE, but it was apparent that an individualised approach underpinned by expert guidance would be required to support engagement.",
        "Older adults living with MLTC, frailty and a recent deterioration in health lack awareness and understanding of RE. Despite a range of barriers, this group appear willing to engage in RE if they are appropriately supported. There is a need to co-design and deliver effective strategies, including education, to raise awareness and understanding of RE, as well as promote engagement in RE, in this group of older adults."
