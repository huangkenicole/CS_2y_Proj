      "AbstractText": [
        "The use of robotic surgery (RS) in urology has grown exponentially in the last decade, but RS training has lagged behind. The launch of new robotic platforms has paved the way for the creation of innovative robotics training systems. The aim of our study is to test the new training system from Hugo\u2122 RAS System-Medtronic. Between July 2020 and September 2022, a total of 44 residents from urology, gynaecology and general surgery at our institution participated in advanced robotic simulation training using the Hugo\u2122 RAS simulator. Information about sex, age, year of residency, hours spent playing video games, laparoscopic or robotic exposure and interest in robotics (90.9% declared an interest in robotics) was collected. The training program involved three robotic exercises, and the residents performed these exercises under the guidance of a robotics tutor. The residents' performance was assessed based on five parameters: timing, range of motion, panoramic view, conflict of instruments and exercise completion. Their performance was evaluated according to an objective Hugo system form and a subjective assessment by the tutor. After completing the training, the residents completed a Likert scale questionnaire to gauge their overall satisfaction. The rate of the residents' improvement in almost all parameters of the three exercises between the first and the last attempts was statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.02), indicating significant progress in the residents' robotic surgical skills during the training. The mean overall satisfaction score \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) was 9.4 \u00b1 1.2, signifying a high level of satisfaction among the residents with the training program. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the training program utilizing the Hugo\u2122 RAS System is effective in enhancing robotic surgical skills among residents and holds promise for the development of standardized robotics training programs in various surgical specialties."
