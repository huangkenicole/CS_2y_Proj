        "This study was intended to determine the applicability of an augmented-reality-based muscle reduction prevention exercise program for elderly Korean women by observing changes in exercise self-efficacy and verifying the effectiveness of the program in the elderly after the application of the program. A total of 27 participants, who were elderly women aged 65+ and had not participated in any exercise programs until this study, were recruited for this study. They were divided into an experimental group (13 people) and a control group (14 people), and then the augmented-reality-based muscle reduction prevention exercise program was applied. This was a 30-min program, which included regular, aerobic, and flexibility exercises, and it was applied 5 times a week for 12 weeks. As a result of observing changes, it was found that the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) (F = 11.222, <i>p</i> < 0.002) and the skeletal muscle index (SMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (F = 10.874, <i>p</i> < 0.003) muscle parameters increased more in the experimental group compared to the control group, and there was a significant increase in gait speed (m/s) (F = 7.221, <i>p</i> < 0.005). For physical performance, as a result of conducting the Senior Fitness Test (SFT), a significant change was observed in the chair stand test (F = 5.110, <i>p</i> < 0.033), 2-min step test (2MST) (F = 6.621, <i>p</i> < 0.020), and the timed up-and-go test (TUG) (F = 5.110, <i>p</i> < 0.032) and a significant increase was also observed for exercise self-efficacy (F = 20.464, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Finally, the augmented-reality-based exercise program in this study was found to be effective in inducing physical activity in the elderly. Therefore, the augmented-reality-based muscle reduction prevention exercise program is considered to be effective in increasing the sustainability of exercise, thus preventing muscle reduction in the elderly."
