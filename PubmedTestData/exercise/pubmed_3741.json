        "In 2017, our team highlighted promising results of a giant exercising board game on physical activity level and a broader array of physical and psychological outcomes among nursing home residents. However, some improvements of this game were needed to make it more suitable for nursing homes and more challenging in terms of exercises. Therefore, we decided to develop a new version of a giant exercising board game: the GAMotion.",
        "The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the impact of the GAMotion on physical capacity among nursing home residents. The secondary aims were to assess the impact of the GAMotion on motivation and quality of life in this population.",
        "A one-month pilot interventional study was performed in two comparable nursing homes. Eleven participants meeting the inclusion criteria took part in the intervention in one nursing home, whereas 10 participants were assigned to the control group in the other institution. The GAMotion required participants to perform strength, flexibility, balance and endurance activities. The assistance provided by an exercising specialist decreased gradually during the intervention in an autonomy-oriented approach based on the self-determination theory. Physical capacity (i.e. fall risk using Tinetti test; dynamic balance using Timed Up and Go test (TUG); physical abilities using SPPB test; grip strength using Jamar dynamometer; isometric lower limb muscle strength using MicroFET2 and quantitative evaluation of walking using Locometrix), motivation (i.e. using Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2) and quality of life (i.e. using EQ-5D questionnaire) were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. A two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess time*group (intervention vs. control group) effects. All the analyses were adjusted on age, which differed significantly between the 2 groups at baseline.",
        "During the intervention period, the experimental group displayed a greater improvement in Tinetti score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), TUG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), SPPB (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), knee extensor isometric strength (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), grip strength (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), symmetry of steps (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), 3 domains of the EQ-5D (i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities: p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and intrinsic motivation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) compared to the control group. No significant improvement was demonstrated on the other parameters.",
        "These promising results should be interpreted with caution because of certain limitations (e.g. small sample size, no blind assessment). Further investigation is required to confirm and evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the GAMotion in nursing homes."
