        "The job environment of a police officer involves unusually high physical and mental stressors paired with hours of prolonged sedentary behavior. The availability of police officers to engage in traditional regularly-scheduled exercises is generally restricted by irregular shift hours. Therefore, supra high-intensity interval training (supra HIIT) may be a viable training option as it elicits physical and mental health benefits and a training session can be completed in less than five minutes.",
        "Twenty-two police officers (37\u00b18 years) performed 4-minute all-out sessions over 9 weeks. An average of 4\u00b11 supra HIIT workouts was completed per week.",
        "Program assessment questions resulted in an overall program satisfaction level of 8.6 on a scale of 10 with very high enjoyment (94%) among the participants. Following the intervention, body fat percentage and fat mass decreased (P=0.003 and 0.028) and muscle mass increased (P=0.002). Arterial stiffness and total cholesterol concentration decreased (P<0.05). Maximal oxygen consumption increased (P=0.010). Wingate anaerobic power and mental and physical health did not change significantly.",
        "A supra HIIT program was highly satisfactory and enjoyable to police officers and was accompanied by a number of favorable effects on body composition, aerobic fitness, and arterial stiffness."
