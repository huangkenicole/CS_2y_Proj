        "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) with equal energy expenditure on glycaemic and cardiometabolic risk factors in people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) when compared to the control. Sixty-three people with T2DM were randomly assigned to HIIT, MICT, or non-exercising controls. Individuals were trained with HIIT at 90 and 30% of their VO<sub>2</sub>peak (1:2 min ratio) starting from 8 up to 16 intervals and MICT at 50% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak, on a cycle ergometer, 3 times/week for 12 weeks under supervision. The primary outcome measure was the change in HbA1c. Aerobic capacity, cardiovascular responses, anthropometric measures, body composition, glycaemic, and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at the beginning and the end of the 12-week training period. There was no significant difference between HIIT and MICT or when compared to the control for HbA1c, glucose, insulin resistance, blood lipids, cardiovascular responses, anthropometric measures, body composition, and abdominal and visceral fat (<i>p</i><sub>adj\u2009</sub>>\u20090.05). HIIT and MICT increased VO<sub>2</sub>peak significantly compared to controls (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) but not to each other (<i>p</i>\u2009>\u20090.05). Both HIIT and MICT improved VO<sub>2</sub>peak and HbA1c after 12 weeks of training compared to their baseline, furthermore, only MICT caused additional improvements in cardiovascular responses, anthropometric measures, and abdominal fat compared to baseline (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). As a conclusion, isoenergetic HIIT or MICT did not improve HbA1c. The two protocols were equally efficient for improvement in aerobic capacity but had little effect on other cardiometabolic factors.<b>Trial registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03682445.<b>Highlights</b>HIIT and MICT with equal energy expenditure were equally efficient for aerobic capacity compared to controls.Isoenergetic HIIT or MICT were not superior for improving HbA1c.Isoenergetic HIIT and MICT were not superior to each other for anthropometric measures, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors."
