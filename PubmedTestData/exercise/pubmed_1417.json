      "AbstractText": [
        "1-repetition maximum (1RM), a representative index for an individual's weightlifting capacity, provides an organized workout guide, but to measure 1RM needs several repetitive exercises up to one's limit and has a risk of injury, thus, not adequate for beginners, elders, or disabled people. This study suggests a simpler and safer 1RM measurement method using a hydraulic fitness machine. We asked twenty-five female subjects with less than a month of experience in weight training to repeat chest exercises using a conventional plate-loaded bench press machine and a hydraulic bench press machine and measured 1RMs. Repeated-measures ANOVA and paired <i>t</i>-test reported the difference between the plate and hydraulic 1RMs insignificant (<i>p</i>-value = 0.082) and confirmed the generality of 1RM across the different types of fitness machines. We then derived several 1RM equations in terms of load weight W and lifting speed v during non-1RM exercise and reduced it to a first-order polynomial expression 1RM=-0.3908+0.8251W+0.1054v with adjusted R-square of 0.8849. Goodness-of-fit test and comparison with 1RM equations from reference studies (v=-1.46\u00d7W1RM+1.7035,&nbsp;W1RM\u00d7100=7.5786v2-75.865v+113.02) verified our formula valid. We finally simplified the 1RM measurement process up to a maximum of three repetitions."
