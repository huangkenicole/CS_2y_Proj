        "A VR-based application was developed to explore the potential of mobile technology and the use of mobile-VR to assist in treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of neck injuries. A prototype was developed through user-centered design and Google Sprint. The application simulated a typical set of exercises that a patient would get from a physiotherapist in the case of neck pain. A semi-structured interview was conducted with a physiotherapist, and an open-ended interview followed to asses usability. Expert and user evaluation indicated that the aim should be to keep patients motivated and working through the pain. The usability was judged as very good. However, clinical evaluation with a patient group would be recommended in the future."
