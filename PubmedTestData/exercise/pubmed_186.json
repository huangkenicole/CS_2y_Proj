        "The evidence of the benefits from regular physical activity to hypertensives is based on dry land training studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of aquatic exercise with dry land training on hypertensive women.",
        "This is a randomized controlled study with 52 post-menopausal hypertensive women. The patients were randomly allocated in three groups: water aerobic training group (n = 19), dry land aerobic training group (n = 19) and a non-intervention control group (n = 14). The training protocol was performed by 12 weeks.",
        "There were no differences among the three groups concerning basal blood pressure (BP) and biochemical variables. In water group, there was a statistically significant reduction of systolic BP from 136 \u00b1 16 mm Hg at zero week to 124 \u00b1 18 mm Hg at 11th week and 124 \u00b1 15 mm Hg at 12th week. In dry land training group, there was a statistically significant reduction of systolic BP from 138 \u00b1 15 mm Hg at zero week to 125 \u00b1 10 mm Hg at 7th week, 127 \u00b1 10 mm Hg at 10th week and 126 \u00b1 9 mm Hg at 12th week. The control group presented no change in any of the assessed variables. No changes were carried out in any antihypertensive medications during study.",
        "This is a randomized controlled study that demonstrates the antihypertensive efficacy of aerobic aquatic exercise."
