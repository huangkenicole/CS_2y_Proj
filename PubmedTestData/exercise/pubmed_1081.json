        "While the health benefits of physical activity are well established, little is known about health effects of physical activity programs initiated by employer.",
        "Background data and level of physical activity were collected by questionnaire among 78 men and 43 women working in road maintenance pre and post an 8-week physical activity motivational program. As a part of the program steps measured by accelerometer were registered online where team and individual performances could be continuously monitored. The physical activity levels were registered as 1) those physical active \u22641 time per week, 2) 2-3 times per week and 3) \u22654 times a week. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), blood pressure, resting heart rate (RHR) and blood samples (glycosylated hemoglobin, lipids and C-reactive protein) were obtained at baseline and after eight weeks. Mixed models were applied to evaluate associations between physical activity and health parameters.",
        "With \u22641 time per week as reference, exercising 2-3 times per week at baseline was associated with higher levels of VO2max. During follow-up, VO2max increased with 2.8\u00a0mL \u2219 kg(-1)\u2219 min(-1) (95 % CI\u2009=\u20091.4, 4.3). Women had more favorable body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, RHR and lipid profile than men. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), RHR and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were lower among participants who exercised 2-3 times per week or \u22654 times a week, compared with those with \u22641 time per week. Half of the participants reported increased daily PA during follow-up, with high intensity PA such as jogging by 8.6\u00a0min (SD 14.6) and 8.3\u00a0min (SD 18.2), among women and men, respectively. During follow-up dBP increased among men. Further, total cholesterol and LDL were reduced by 0.12\u00a0mmol/L and 0.13\u00a0mmol/L, respectively (95 % CI\u2009=\u2009-022, -0.01 and -0.22,-0.04).",
        "Exercise several times a week was associated with lower blood pressure and a favorable lipid status compared to lower weekly activity. During the 8-week follow-up of an employer initiated exercise program VO2max increased, while total cholesterol and LDL were reduced.",
