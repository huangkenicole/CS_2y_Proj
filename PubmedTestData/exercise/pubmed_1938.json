        "In people with stable coronary heart disease, what are the effects of water-based circuit training exercise on aerobic capacity, strength and body composition? How do these effects compare with those of gym-based exercise?",
        "Parallel group, randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis.",
        "Fifty-two participants with stable coronary heart disease.",
        "Twelve weeks of: three 1-hour sessions per week of moderate-intensity water-based circuit training exercise with alternating aerobic and resistance stations (WEX); three 1-hour sessions per week of moderate-intensity gym-based circuit training exercise (GEX); or continuing usual activities (control).",
        "Aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2peak</sub>), upper and lower limb one repetition maximum strength (biceps curl, latissimus dorsi pulldown, hamstring curl and leg press), anthropometry (weight, body mass index and girth) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.",
        "Forty-five participants completed the study (WEX n\u00a0= 15, GEX n\u00a0= 18, control n\u00a0= 12). Both training groups significantly improved VO<sub>2peak</sub> compared with control: WEX by 2.5 ml/kg/min (95% CI 0.6 to 4.4) and GEX by 2.3 ml/kg/min (95% CI 0.6 to 4.0). WEX and GEX improved hamstring strength compared with control: WEX by 6.3 kg (95% CI 1.2 to 11.3) and GEX by 7.6 kg (95% CI 2.9 to 12.2). Compared with control, GEX increased leg press strength by 15.5 kg (95% CI 5.7 to 25.3), whereas the effect of WEX was less clear (MD 7.1 kg, 95% CI -3.5 to 17.7). Only GEX improved latissimus dorsi pulldown strength. Compared with control, total body fat was reduced with WEX (-1.1 kg, 95% CI -2.3 to 0.0) and GEX (-1.2 kg, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.1). There were negligible between-group differences in weight or waist circumference.",
        "WEX was well tolerated and improved aerobic capacity, leg strength and body fat to a similar degree as GEX in people with coronary heart disease. These findings suggest that WEX is an effective exercise training alternative to GEX for people with coronary heart disease.",
