        "The number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rising at an alarming rate. Regular physical activity and exercise are cornerstones in the therapy of T2DM. While a one-size-fits-all approach fails to account for many between-subject differences, the use of personalized exercise medicine has the potential of optimizing health outcomes. Here, a road map for personalized exercise therapy targeted at patients with T2DM is presented. It considers secondary complications, glucose management, response heterogeneity, and other relevant factors that might influence the effectiveness of exercise as medicine, taking exercise-medication-diet interactions, as well as feasibility and acceptance into account. Furthermore, the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based applications in assisting sports therapists to find appropriate exercise programs is outlined."
