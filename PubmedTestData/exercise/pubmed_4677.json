        "Non-specific low back pain is a common condition with significant global prevalence and socio-economic impact. Back School programs, which combine exercise and educational interventions, have been used to address back pain. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a Back School-based intervention on non-specific low back pain in adults. Secondary objectives included evaluating the impact of the program on disability, quality of life, and kinesiophobia.",
        "A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 40 participants with non-specific low back pain, who were divided into two groups. The experimental group underwent an 8-week Back School-based program. The program comprised 14 practical sessions focusing on strengthening and flexibility exercises, along with two theoretical sessions covering anatomy and concepts related to a healthy lifestyle. The control group maintained their usual lifestyle. Assessment instruments included the Visual Analogue Scale, Roland Morris disability questionnaire, Short-Form Health Survey-36, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.",
        "The experimental group showed significant improvements in the Visual Analogue Scale, Roland Morris disability questionnaire, physical components of the Short-Form Health Survey-36, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. However, there were no significant improvements in the psychosocial components of the Short-Form Health Survey-36. In contrast, the control group did not show significant results in any of the study variables.",
        "The Back School-based program has positive effects on pain, low back disability, physical components of quality of life, and kinesiophobia in adults with non-specific low back pain. However, it does not appear to improve the participants' psychosocial components of quality of life. Healthcare professionals can consider implementing this program to help reduce the significant socio-economic impact of non-specific low back pain worldwide.",
