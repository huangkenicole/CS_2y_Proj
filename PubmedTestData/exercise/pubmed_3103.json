        "To assess hemodynamic and physical function responses during a two-month multicomponent group exercise program (MCEP) in residents of long-term care facilities.",
        "40 older long-term care residents were randomly allocated equally to an intervention (IG; n\u00a0=\u00a020; 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 years) and control group (CG; n\u00a0=\u00a020; 79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 years); they all submitted to hemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) and functional assessments before and after the MCEP. The IG performed a twice-weekly, two-months multicomponent exercise program composed of functional mobility, balance, muscle strength, and flexibility exercises; while the CG did not perform any exercise intervention.",
        "There was a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (7.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.64\u00a0mmHg; t\u00a0=\u00a02.2; effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.34; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) following a two-month MCEP as compared with baseline. In all functional measurements (balance, mobility) were significantly improved after the MCEP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).",
        "These data indicate that a two-month MCEP can improve systolic blood pressure and functionality in older residents of long-term care facilities."
