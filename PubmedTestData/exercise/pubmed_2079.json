        "Interrupting prolonged sitting acutely lowers blood pressure in nonstroke populations. However, the dose-response effect in stroke survivors is unknown. The authors investigated different doses of light-intensity standing exercises that interrupt prolonged sitting and reduce blood pressure immediately and over 24 hours in stroke survivors.",
        "Within-participant, laboratory-based, dose escalation trial. Conditions (8\u00a0h) were prolonged sitting and 2 experimental conditions of standing exercises with increasing frequency (3 cohorts, 2 \u00d7 5\u00a0min to 6 \u00d7 5\u00a0min). The primary outcome is the mean systolic blood pressure.",
        "Twenty-nine stroke survivors (aged 66 [12]\u00a0y) participated. Frequent bouts of standing exercises lowered the mean systolic blood pressure following the 4 \u00d7 5-minute (-2.1\u00a0mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.6 to -0.6) and 6 \u00d7 5-minute conditions (-2.3\u00a0mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5) compared with prolonged sitting. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered following the 6 \u00d7 5-minute condition (-1.4\u00a0mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.7 to -0.2). The 24-hour systolic blood pressure increased following the 2 \u00d7 5-minute condition (6.9\u00a0mm Hg; 95% CI, 3.1 to 10.6).",
        "Interrupting prolonged sitting with more frequent bouts of standing exercises lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure in stroke survivors. However, reductions may only be short term, and investigations on sustained effects are warranted."
