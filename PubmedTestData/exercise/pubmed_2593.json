        "Analyze the effects of a multicomponent aquatic exercise program on motor aspects, functional mobility, muscle function and aquatic motor skills of people with PD.",
        "Eighteen people with a PD diagnosis were assessed before and after a 12-week multicomponent aquatic exercise program, twice a week, with each session lasting 50\u00a0min. The terrestrial variables analyzed were motor aspects, through the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); functional mobility, through the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST); Peak Torque (PT) and Mean Power (MP) of hip, knee and ankle flexors and extensors, assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. In water, aquatic motor skill levels were assessed by means of the Aquatic Functional Assessment Scale (AFAS).",
        "Significant improvements were found after the intervention in the following outcomes: motor aspects (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a05-61); MP of knee flexors at 90\u00b0/s on the most affected side (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a05.14), MP of knee extensors at 90\u00b0/s on the most affected side (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a08.69), MP of knee extensors at 120\u00b0/s on the most affected side (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a08.35), and AFAS in the domain of specialized therapeutic exercises (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a01.28).",
        "The completed multicomponent aquatic exercise program promoted changes in muscle function and terrestrial and aquatic functional outcomes in people with PD."
