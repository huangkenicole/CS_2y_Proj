        "Rosenberg, J, Hyde, PN, Yancy, WS, Ford, KM, and Champ, CE. Quantity of resistance exercise for breast cancer patients: does the dose match the objective? J Strength Cond Res 35(5): 1467-1476, 2021-There is currently a lack of consensus as to what defines exercise and resistance training in the cancer setting and whether current studies comply with exercise guidelines. This study aimed to quantify the available research studies using resistance training exercise interventions in the breast cancer setting for future clinical trial utilization. We systemically reviewed all available resistance exercise studies during and after breast cancer treatment in an attempt to quantify to the prescribed dose and whether regimens aligned with general exercise guidelines to improve functional mobility, body composition, and metabolic function. They were then compared with recommendations set forth by the national committees that create evidence-based exercise guidelines. Fifty studies met the initial criteria, with 35 meeting analysis criteria for evaluation. Fifteen studies evaluated an exercise regimen during cancer treatment, and 20 evaluated a regimen after treatment. The average adherence rates were 84% for all studies. Only 23 studies listed specific exercises used within the protocol. Most exercise regimens relied on open chain movements and machine exercises. Around half of studies met criteria to achieve hypertrophy, and 66% met American College of Sports Medicine exercise guidelines for cancer patients. A minority of breast cancer studies implementing a resistance training exercise regimen prescribed a regimen or specific dose that follows general exercise guidelines. This study highlights a potential deficiency in exercise programs designed for patients with breast cancer, and these findings should be considered in future study design."
