Squat and bench press force-velocity profiling in male and female adolescent rugby players. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S44-S50, 2021-Power development is critical for enhancing rugby performance because there is a close relationship between power and sport-specific skills. The aim of this study was to examine the force-velocity profiling generated by adolescent rugby players in the squat and bench press exercises and to compare sex-related differences. Subjects were 46 men (age: 14.48 \u00b1 1.31 years; body height: 1.65 \u00b1 0.09 m; and body mass: 58.07 \u00b1 13.01 kg) and 41 women (age: 14.93 \u00b1 2.76 years; body height: 1.63 \u00b1 0.12 m; and body mass: 59.23 \u00b1 12.66 kg) who were recruited from a national amateur rugby league team. Maximal strength, power, and velocity were assessed on the squat and bench press exercises using a Smith Machine and a linear power transducer with intensities ranging from 40 to 80% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) on the squat and 50-80% 1RM on the bench press. 1 repetition maximum squat and bench press performance were 104.26 \u00b1 30.83 and 46.97 \u00b1 13.59 kg, respectively, for men and 115.17 \u00b1 41.42 and 45.85 \u00b1 16.71 kg, respectively, for women. The maximum squat power results for men and women were 521.91 \u00b1 298.75 and 591.26 \u00b1 352.69 W, respectively, and the maximum bench press power results for men and women were 190.26 \u00b1 150.54 and 326.16 \u00b1 195.57 W, respectively. Significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found on the squat exercise for maximum (40%), mean (40-50%), and time to maximum velocities (40-80%) as well as time to maximum power (80%). On the bench press exercise, significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found for power and time to maximum velocity (40%-60%-70%-80%). These results may aid in the design of strength and conditioning programs for adolescent rugby players by targeting training prescriptions toward enhancing strength or velocity."
