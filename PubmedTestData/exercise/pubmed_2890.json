        "Exercise improves the quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients recovering from treatment. Since group exercise fosters cohesion, we sought to determine if paired exercise would have similar, positive effects. An experiential study design was used to compare the effect of exercise (12 weeks) on psychosocial health in paired versus individually trained cancer patients.",
        "Female cancer patients (n = 28) who completed cancer treatment were placed into either the singly trained or paired group. Groups were matched for cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption, single: 24.1 \u00b1 7.4, pair: 24.8 \u00b1 6.3 ml/kg/min) and age (single: 58 \u00b1 12, pair: 58 \u00b1 9 years). Patients participated in 36, 90-min exercise sessions in accordance with exercise recommendations. QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, FACT-G), depressive, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms were measured before, midway, and after the intervention. Fitness was measured pre- and post-intervention. Participants did not meet prior to the intervention. Two-way ANOVAs and multiple comparisons tests were used to detect differences (p < 0.05).",
        "Emotional well-being and total FACT-G scores were significantly improved in the paired but not individually trained patients. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved at mid- and final time points in the paired group. Paired patients reported significant improvements in insomnia symptoms from pre- to mid-intervention. Depressive and insomnia symptoms in the individually trained group were unchanged. A significant main effect of group was detected in fatigue scores in patients who were not chronically tired at baseline (F(1, 12) = 6.318, p = 0.0272). Both groups exhibited similar improvements in fitness.",
        "Paired exercisers had greater benefits in QOL, emotional well-being, and insomnia and depressive symptoms compared to individual exercisers."
