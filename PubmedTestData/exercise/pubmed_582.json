        "Neurocognitive impairment is a group of clinical syndromes characterized by impaired cognitive function and decreased motor ability. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical exercise have advantages in the treatment of patients with neurocognitive impairment. Multicomponent exercise is a combination of various physical exercises, including strength training, endurance training, balance training and flexibility training, that can improve gait, balance and cardiopulmonary function by increasing muscle mass, strength and endurance in people with neurocognitive impairment, while also reducing the risk of falls in elders. This article reviews the benefits of multicomponent exercise for patients with neurocognitive impairment and its evaluation methods; also describes 4 intervention programs and their clinical application, to provide evidence for clinical practice and promote the application of multicomponent exercise in patients with neurocognitive impairment."
