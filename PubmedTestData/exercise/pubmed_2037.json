        "Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) experience an asymmetrical gait pattern and poor balance capabilities. Effective interventions, therefore, are needed to facilitate remediation of these functional issues.",
        "This study was set out to investigate the emerging role of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) exercises on gait-symmetry and balance in children with UCP.",
        "In this randomized controlled trial, 42 children with UCP (age; 8 -12 years) were enrolled and received either standard physical rehabilitation (control group; n\u200a=\u200a21) or the SSC exercise program plus physical rehabilitation (SSC group; n\u200a=\u200a21). Spatial- and temporal-gait symmetry index (GSI) and specific balance capabilities [reactive balance, directional control, movement synchronization, and sensory organization] were assessed before and after 16 sessions that were carried out twice/week over non-sequential days in an 8-week program.",
        "Using the pre-treatment scores as covariates, the post-treatment spatial- (P\u200a=\u200a0.006; \u03b7p2=\u200a0.17) and temporal- GSI (P\u200a<\u200a.001; \u03b7p2=\u200a0.46) scores reduced significantly in the SSC group as compared to the control group, suggesting favorable improvement of gait symmetry. Also, all measures of balance (P\u200a<\u200a0.05; \u03b7p2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.29) improved remarkably, post-treatment, in SSC group in comparison with the control group.",
        "The evidence from this study suggests that SSC exercises besides standard physical rehabilitation appear to be effective for improving gait symmetry and boosting balance capabilities in children with UCP."
