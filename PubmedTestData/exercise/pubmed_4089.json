        "The vestibular system registers changes in head position, gravity, vibration, acceleration and deceleration. This information is then transmitted to the central nervous system, where additional information from the visual and auditory systems, muscles, tendons, joints and skin, serve to regulate and maintain the equilibrium and orientation of the system. Vision plays the most obvious part in continual monitoring of the environment. Distances, speeds of linear and angular movement, and changes of direction, can all be estimated with experience and be integrated in the central nervous system with those received by other sensory systems. Light touch and pressure receptors in the skin detect bodily contact with the environment and are an essential source of data in walking, cycling, motoring, flying and other activities. Proprioception provides data regarding the instantaneous mechanical disposition of the musculoskeletal system as it relates to the force of gravity acting upon it. The functional recovery that occurs after unilateral vestibular lesions is referred to as \"vestibular compensation\" and consists of all the processes of neurological reorganization that allow recovering balance after a unilateral vestibular lesion. Exercises are particularly useful in helping patients to overcome disturbances, associated with balance disorders. The purpose of these selected exercises is to build up a tolerance mechanism in the brain, which will compensate for the unequal balance of the two ears."
