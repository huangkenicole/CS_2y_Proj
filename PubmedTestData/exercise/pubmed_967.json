        "Literature studies concerning the effect of implementing a multicomponent program with different individual exercise intensities are insufficient. This study aimed to examine the effects of performing a multicomponent exercise program incorporating high-speed power training on cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and muscular strength in poststroke patients. We compared the results of two different exercise regimens: high-speed power training and traditional low-speed strength training.",
        "Forty-five poststroke patients were randomly assigned to the high-speed, low-speed, and control groups. A 60-min multicomponent exercise program was conducted three times per week for 8 weeks in the two exercise groups, whereas static stretching was performed in the control group. Cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and muscular strength were assessed before and after the intervention.",
        "Significant improvements were observed in the peak oxygen consumption values and results of the Berg balance scale, Korean version of the Trunk Impairment Scale, and Timed Up-and-Go test. The aforementioned were evaluated as a measure of cardiorespiratory function and functional ability in the exercise groups and compared to those obtained in the control group. High-speed power training led to greater improvement in patients compared with low-speed strength training.",
        "Multicomponent exercise involving high-speed power training was beneficial in helping patients with stroke regain cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and muscular strength."
