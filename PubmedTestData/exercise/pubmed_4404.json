        "Multimodal agility-based exercise training (MAT) has been described as a framework for fall prevention in the elderly but might also be a valuable concept for exercise training in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS).",
        "Current recommendations advise pwMS to perform a multitude of different exercise training activities, as each of these has its separate evidence. However, pwMS struggle even more than the general population to be physically active. Additionally, Multiple Sclerosis often leads to co-occurring mobility and cognitive dysfunctions, for which simultaneous, time-efficient, and engaging training approaches are still limited in clinical practice and healthcare.",
        "The MAT framework has been developed to integratively improve cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and cognitive function by combining aspects of perception and orientation, change of direction, as well as stop-and-go patterns (ie, agility), in a group-training format. For pwMS, the MAT framework is conceptualized to include 3 Components: standing balance, dynamic balance (including functional leg strength), and agility-based exercises. Within these Components sensory, cognitive, and cardiovascular challenges can be adapted to individual needs.",
        "We recommend investigating multimodal exercise interventions that go beyond easily standardized, unimodal types of exercise (eg, aerobic or resistance exercise), which could allow for time-efficient training, targeting multiple frequent symptoms of persons with mild disability at once. MAT should be compared to unimodal approaches, regarding sensor-based gait outcomes, fatigue-related outcomes, cognition, as well as neuroprotective, and (supportive) disease-modifying effects."
