        "Aerobic training and breathing exercises are interventions that improve asthma control. However, the outcomes of these 2 interventions have not been compared.",
        "To compare the effects of aerobic training versus breathing exercises on clinical control (primary outcome), quality of life, exercise capacity, and airway inflammation in outpatients with moderate-to-severe asthma.",
        "Fifty-four asthmatics were randomized into either the aerobic training group (AG, n\u00a0= 29) or the breathing exercise group (BG, n\u00a0= 25). Both interventions lasted for 24 sessions (2/week, 40 minutes/session). Asthma clinical control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), asthma symptom-free days (ASFD), airway inflammation, exercise capacity, psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), daily-life physical activity (DLPA), and pulmonary function were evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention.",
        "Both interventions presented similar results regarding the ACQ score, psychological distress, ASFD, DLPA, and airway inflammation (P > .05). However, participants in the AG were 2.6 times more likely to experience clinical improvement at the 3-month follow-up than participants in the BG (P\u00a0= .02). A greater proportion of participants in the AG also presented a reduction in the number of days without rescue medication use compared with BG (34% vs 8%; P\u00a0= .04).",
        "Outpatients with moderate-to-severe asthma who participated in aerobic training or breathing exercise programs presented similar results in asthma control, quality of life, asthma symptoms, psychological distress, physical activity, and airway inflammation. However, a greater proportion of participants in the AG presented improvement in asthma control and reduced use of rescue medication."
