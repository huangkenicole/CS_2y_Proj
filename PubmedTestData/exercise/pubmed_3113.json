        "Recently, swallowing resistive exercise using kinesiology taping (KT) has been reported as a novel method for dysphagia rehabilitation However, clinical evidence is still unclear, and effects in the elderly have not been confirmed.",
        "This study aimed to investigate the effects of suprahyoid muscle strengthening exercise using KT on muscle activation and thickness in community-dwelling elderly.",
        "A total of 24 healthy older people were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to an experimental group and a placebo group. In the experimental group, KT was attached to the front of the neck with a tension of about 70% to 80%, and a resistive swallowing exercise was performed. In the placebo group, the tape was applied similarly but without tension. Both groups performed resistive swallowing exercises 10 times a day (50 swallows per day) for 6 weeks. The activation and thickness of the suprahyoid muscles were measured using portable ultrasound equipment and an surface electromyelograph device.",
        "The experimental group showed a significant increase in suprahyoid muscle activation (mean and peak) and muscle thickness (digastric and mylohyoid) than the placebo group (all, P < .05).",
        "This study confirmed that suprahyoid muscle strengthening exercise using KT had a positive effect on the suprahyoid muscles in healthy older adults, thus suggesting the possibility of a therapeutic exercise method for dysphagia rehabilitation."
