        "Regular exercise training has beneficial effects on quality of life, physical function, depression and anxiety in individuals with heart failure. Unfortunately, individuals with heart failure have low levels of adherence to exercise. Thus, studies are needed to assess intervention strategies which may enhance clinical outcomes.",
        "The aim of this study was to identify the components of the HEART Camp intervention, which contributed to optimizing clinical outcomes.",
        "The Heart Failure Exercise and Resistance Training Camp (HEART Camp) was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent intervention on adherence to exercise (6, 12 and 18 months) compared to an enhanced usual care group. This study assessed various components of the intervention on the secondary outcomes of physical function, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.",
        "Individuals participating (<i>n</i>=204) in this study were 55.4% men and the average age was 60.4 (11.5) years. A combination of individualized and group-based strategies demonstrated clinical improvements, HEART Camp versus enhanced usual care groups, in physical function, positive trends in health-related quality of life and positive changes in the minimally important differences for depression, anxiety, and fatigue.",
        "Individualized coaching by an exercise professional and group-based educational sessions were identified as important components of patient management contributing to improvements in the secondary outcomes of physical function, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety and fatigue."
