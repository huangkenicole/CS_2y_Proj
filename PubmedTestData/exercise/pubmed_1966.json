      "AbstractText": [
        "Telerehabilitation and follow-up techniques have been developed in recent years to assess the effectiveness of diverse intervention programmes that include exergaming technologies. For patients with upper limb impairment after stroke, motion-gaming technologies can provide effective and amusing training. Beyond efficiency, professionals must analyse patient compliance with the system for self-use at home, because patients may or may not independently perform the exercises prescribed by the therapist. Questions on the sustainable use of this type of home exercise also arise.",
        "This review examines user compliance with exercise programmes, measured according to the training rate (percentage of prescribed sessions and minutes completed) and completion rate (number of drop-outs and discontinued interventions) reported or calculable according to the data collected.",
        "Rates of compliance with training were relatively high. No group effect on compliance was found. Drop-out and discontinued intervention rates were either due to external causes or directly related to the technologies. Some studies have reported the use of supervision, most of them through home visits and remote support. Few studies performed long-term follow-up, which could provide information to help broaden practices. This narrative review considers how this field of research may evolve in the future."
