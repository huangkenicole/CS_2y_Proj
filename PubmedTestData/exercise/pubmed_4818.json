        "Exergaming is a type of serious game that requires active bodily movements for video gameplay. This game-based exercise is gaining interest as a form of leisure activity of moderate-vigorous dose intensity.",
        "This case report sought to assess the effects of exergaming training (i.e. Move Boxing, Move Tennis, and Move Gladiator Duel) on aerobic capacity, feasibility, enjoyment and motivation in two individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "Two males with SCI at the level of L4 and T10, aged 32 and 39, respectively, underwent home-based exergaming training sessions over a period of 12-18\u00a0weeks, conducted within moderate-vigorous intensity training zones for health improvements as recommended by health guidelines. Their peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), physical activity levels and perceived enjoyment were evaluated before, during and after the completion of the training.",
        "Participant peak VO<sub>2</sub> improved (effect size g =\u00a02.7) from their baseline values (Participant A: 16.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 mL/kg/min to 41.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1 mL/kg/min; Participant B: 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 mL/kg/min to 32.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 mL/kg/min), with an increase in overall weekly physical activity levels. Both participants maintained a relatively high level of enjoyment scores throughout their training period (mean: 31.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2, <i>p</i> =\u00a0.56, 95% CI 0.22-1.0).",
        "A home-based exergaming training program improved aerobic capacity and level of physical activity, while maintaining adherence to the exercise within a relatively high perception of enjoyment for these two participants. The relatively high enjoyment scores maintained throughout the duration of the exergaming training period suggested its feasibility as a home-based exercise program and perceived as enjoyable by these individuals."
