        "Heinecke, ML, Mauldin, ML, Hunter, ML, Mann, JB, and Mayhew, JL. Relationship of barbell and dumbbell repetitions with one repetition maximum bench press in college football players. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S66-S71, 2021-Dumbbell training to augment barbell training is gaining popularity. However, information is lacking that details the compatibility of strength and endurance between dumbbell and barbell performances in the same exercise. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to compare the similarity of muscular endurance performance between dumbbell and barbell exercises and to assess the accuracy of predicting one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell bench press from barbell and dumbbell repetitions to fatigue (RTF). College football players (n = 40) performed 1RM barbell bench press and RTF with a 90.9-kg barbell. On separate days, unilateral (45.5 kg) and bilateral dumbbell (90.9 kg) RTF were performed. Barbell RTF (13.8 \u00b1 9.2) were significantly greater (effect size [ES] = 0.14) than bilateral dumbbell RTF (12.5 \u00b1 9.5) but highly correlated (r = 0.96). Unilateral dumbbell RTF were significantly greater (ES = 0.13) for dominant hand (10.8 \u00b1 10.1) than nondominant hand (9.5 \u00b1 9.7) but highly correlated (r = 0.97). Prediction of 1RM barbell bench press was equally effective using a constant weight barbell (r = 0.90) or equivalent weight bilateral dumbbells (r = 0.87) with total errors of 7.3 and 8.2%, respectively. Barbell and dumbbell repetitions with equivalent weights place a similar demand on the upper-body musculature for training and testing purposes in football athletes."
