        "Schools provide a favorable setting for health education, however, the most effective school-based exercise mode for improving physical fitness remains unclear. This network meta-analysis was designed to assess and rank the comparative efficacy of six exercise modalities on physical fitness indicators in a school-based setting.",
        "An online search of the Web of Science, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus databases was conducted. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials were considered. Outcomes included measures of anthropometry and body composition, muscular fitness, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Data were pooled with a random effects model using the frequentist framework.",
        "A total of 66 studies with 8,578 participants (48% girls) were included. High-intensity interval training was the most effective intervention reducing body mass index (mean difference (MD)\u2009=\u2009-0.60\u2009kg\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>, 95% confidence interval (95%CI)\u2009=\u2009-1.04 to -0.15, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.009), elevating VO<sub>2max</sub> (MD\u2009=\u20093.59\u2009mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.45 to 4.74, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), and 20-meter sprint performance (MD\u2009=\u2009-0.35\u2009s, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.55 to -0.14, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001). Aerobic training had the highest probability of reducing waist circumference (standardized mean difference (SMD)\u2009=\u2009-0.60, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.88 to -0.32, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Active video games emerged as a promising modality for improving countermovement jump (MD\u2009=\u20092.43\u2009cm, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.06 to 4.80, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.041) and shuttle running performance (SMD\u2009=\u20090.86, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.29 to 1.43, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.003). Strength training was the best exercise mode for improving standing long jump performance (SMD\u2009=\u20091.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.07 to 1.98, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.035) while combined training was rated the first for decreasing body fat percent (MD\u2009=\u2009-2.56%, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-4.73 to -0.40, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.022) and increasing push-up repetitions (SMD\u2009=\u20093.59, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.81 to 6.37, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.012).",
        "School-based exercise interventions have multiple effects on physical fitness. The findings of this study will help to inform physical education teachers and coaches how best to deliver exercise programs in a school setting. Since the study was limited by the original research, the conclusions will require further verification using high-quality randomized controlled trials.",
