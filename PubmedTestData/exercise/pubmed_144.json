        "To investigate the evidence and provide clinical recommendations for low intensity exercises(LIE) and blood flow restriction(BFR) without exercise on reducing the effects of exercise induced muscle damage(EIMD).",
        "PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and PEDro(Physiotherapy Evidence Database) were searched up to December 2019 for studies that included LIE or BFR without exercise and their effect on EIMD.",
        "Out of 3192 studies, 23 were included with 17 on LIE and 6 on BFR without exercise. 11 studies demonstrated positive effects for LIE on EIMD, with two level 2 and nine level 3 studies. Two level 2 and two level 3 studies found benefits for BFR without exercise on reducing the negative effects of EIMD, while two level 2 studies found did not find benefits for BFR without exercise.",
        "Moderate to low levels of evidence supported LIE, particularly in the form of protective low load eccentric exercise, in reducing the negative effects of EIMD. Conflicting moderate to low levels of evidence was found regarding BFR without exercise. There does seem to be potential benefit for BFR without exercise in untrained individuals. Clinicians can provide clinical recommendations as LIE and BFR without exercise reducing EIMD."
