        "Regular exercise is one of the most powerful treatments for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exercise is also beneficial for those living with type 1 diabetes although challenges exist with its prescription as it can promote both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia and motivating patients is always a challenge. Nonetheless, promoting regular exercise should be the cornerstone of all healthcare professionals working with these patients. In this year's review on exercise and exercise equipment, we highlight 10 publications that focus on topics ranging from exercise adherence to fuel metabolism. We also highlight some new innovative tools that facilitate exercise participation and evaluation."
