        "This observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial compared the short- and long-term effects of 4\u00a0months of supervised strength training (ST) in a local fitness center, supervised Nordic Walking (NW) in a local park, and unsupervised home-based exercise (HBE, control) on functional performance in 60+-year-old persons (n\u00a0=\u00a0152) with hip osteoarthritis (OA) not awaiting hip replacement. Functional performance [i.e., 30-s chair stand test (primary outcome), timed stair climbing, and 6-min walk test] and self-reported outcomes (i.e., physical function, pain, physical activity level, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life) were measured at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 months. Based on intention-to-treat-analyses improvements [mean (95% CI)] after intervention in number of chair stands were equal in all three groups at 4 months [ST: 0.9 (0.2-1.6), NW: 1.9 (0.8-3.0), HBE: 1.1 (0.1-2.0)] but greater in the NW group [1.4 (0.02-2.8)] than in the ST group at 12 months. Generally, improvements in functional performance were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001-P\u00a0<\u00a00.03) after NW compared with HBE and ST at all follow-up time points. Furthermore, NW was superior (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) to HBE for improving vigorous physical activity and to both ST and HBE for improving (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) mental health. These data suggest that NW is the recommended exercise modality compared with ST and HBE."
