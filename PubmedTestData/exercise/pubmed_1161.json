        "Decreased postural stability is observed in older adults. There is an increased risk of falls, which may lead to serious complications and death. Elderly people can maintain and even improve their postural stability through properly selected exercises. This study investigated the effect of exercise using the Emil Jaques-Dalcroze's Eurhythmics (JDE) method on the postural stability of women over 65\u00a0years of age. The study model was based on a randomized controlled trial-parallel group design. Fifty-nine women (69.85\u2009\u00b1\u20093.29) were divided into two groups: intervention (IG, n\u2009=\u200926) and control (CG, n\u2009=\u200933). The IG subjects participated in a JDE exercise programme for 12\u00a0weeks, twice a week for 45\u00a0min each. Postural stability was determined using a test on the AMTI AccuSway Plus posturography platform, recording centre of pressure (COP) point displacement. A biofeedback model was used. Accuracy, speed and reaction time of movements were assessed. Two measurement sessions were conducted in both groups: 1\u00a0week before starting the exercise programme and immediately afterwards. After 12\u00a0weeks of exercise, subjects from IG scored significantly better in the test of accuracy (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and speed (p\u2009<\u20090.05) of movements. Additionally, for parameters determining accuracy of movements, an interaction between allocation to a group and a measurement session was shown (group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time). A 12-week exercise program using the JDE method improves the postural stability of women over 65\u00a0years of age by improving the parameters of speed and accuracy of torso movements."
