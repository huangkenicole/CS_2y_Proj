        "Techniques to increase physical activity among pulmonary rehabilitation patients outside of the rehabilitation context are warranted. Implementation intentions are a strategy used to initiate goal-directed behaviour, and have been found to be useful in other populations. This study compared the long-term effects of exercise and social implementation intentions interventions on objectively measured physical activity in 40 pulmonary rehabilitation patients randomly assigned to condition. Repeated measures ANOVAs found that those in the exercise implementation intentions group took more steps (p\u00a0=\u00a0.007) at the end of pulmonary rehabilitation than those in the social implementation intentions group. Improvements attained by the exercise group during the intervention were not maintained 6-months following rehabilitation. Implementation intentions targeting physical activity appear to have positive short term effects on physical activity, although the long term effects are less consistent. This may be due in part to methods used to assess physical activity behaviour."
