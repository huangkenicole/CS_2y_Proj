        "The aim of this study was to test the effects of aerobic cycling training on O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in several leg muscles in early post-myocardial infarction (post-MI). Fifteen post-MI patients were divided into a 12-week training group (TR, n\u00a0=\u00a09) or a control/non-training group (CON, n\u00a0=\u00a06). All participants performed ramp bicycle exercise until exhaustion at two times: within 12-35\u00a0days of their MI and then again 12\u00a0weeks later. Muscle O<sub>2</sub> saturation (SmO<sub>2</sub>) and total hemoglobin concentration (\u2206total-Hb) were monitored continuously at thigh and lower leg muscles by near infrared spectroscopy. In CON, there were no significant alterations in muscle O<sub>2</sub> dynamics between before and after 12\u00a0weeks at any measurement sites. In TR, after 12\u00a0weeks, lower SmO<sub>2</sub> was observed at all measurement sites. In total-Hb, no significant changes were found after training at any measurement sites in TR. Moreover, the muscle deoxygenation after 12\u00a0weeks was related to an improvement of peak O<sub>2</sub> uptake in all muscles. Our findings suggest that aerobic cycling training may be useful for early post-MI patients to improve peak aerobic capacity via enhancement of muscle deoxygenation and O<sub>2</sub> extraction at several leg muscles."
