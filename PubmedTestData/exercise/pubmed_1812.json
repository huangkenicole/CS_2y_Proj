        "Video game technology increases adherence to home exercise and could support self-management for older people with chronic low back pain (LBP).",
        "The objective was to investigate the effects of home-based video game exercises on pain self-efficacy and care-seeking in older people with chronic LBP.",
        "The study was a randomized controlled trial.",
        "The setting was a community and waiting list.",
        "Sixty participants, aged > 55 years with chronic LBP, were randomized (1:1) to Wii Fit U exercises or to continue their usual activities for 8 weeks.",
        "The intervention was home-based Wii Fit U flexibility, strengthening, and aerobic exercises for 60 minutes, 3 times per week, with fortnightly calls from a physical therapist.",
        "Measurements included pain self-efficacy and care-seeking (primary outcomes), and physical activity, pain, function, disability, fear of movement/reinjury, falls efficacy, recruitment and response rates, adherence, experience with the intervention, and adverse events (secondary outcomes).",
        "The mean age of participants was 67.8 (standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a06.0) years. Adherence to the total recommended exercise time was 70.8%, and no adverse events were reported. Participants completing Wii Fit U exercises had significantly higher pain self-efficacy at 6 months, but not immediately postintervention or at 3 months; there were no between-group differences in care-seeking. Compared with the control group, participants completing Wii Fit U exercises demonstrated significantly greater improvements in pain and function at 8 weeks and were more likely to engage in flexibility exercises at 6 months. There were no significant between-group differences for the remaining outcomes.",
        "Participants and therapists were not blinded.",
        "Wii Fit U exercises improved pain self-efficacy at 6 months, and pain and function immediately postintervention in older people with chronic LBP, but the clinical importance of these changes is questionable. Wii Fit U exercises had no effect on care-seeking, physical activity, disability, fear of movement/reinjury, or falls efficacy."
