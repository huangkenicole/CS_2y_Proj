        "Lateral abdominal muscles control the lumbar region and this manages the stability of the trunk through co-contraction. Abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) is the basis method for spine stabilization to restore proper neuromuscular control.",
        "To investigate the effect of therapeutic abdominal drawing-in maneuver on abdominal muscle thickness and balance.",
        "Twenty healthy adults were divided into 2 groups. The experimental group performed a bridging exercise with ADIM whereas the control group performed a bridging exercise without ADIM. The exercise was conducted 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Ultrasonography was used to measure the thickness of abdominal muscles. Balance ability was evaluated using Tetrax device. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of pre and post values and Mann Whitney U test for comparison between groups were used.",
        "After 4 weeks, there was a significant difference in the thickness of TrA between groups (p< 0.05) whereas no significant difference in IO and EO (p> 0.05). In stability values, the experimental group showed significant changes in stability indexes of standing with eyes open (NO) and standing on the pillow with eyes closed (PC) after the exercise period and there was a significant difference in NO between two groups.",
        "Performing the bridging exercise with abdominal drawing-in maneuver is a more effective way to strengthen the abdominal muscles and stabilize the body than bridging exercise only."
