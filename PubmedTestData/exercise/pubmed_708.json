        "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an obstructive condition where the flow of blood through peripheral arteries is impeded. During periods of increased oxygen demand (e.g. during exercise), peripheral limb ischaemia occurs, resulting in the sensation of muscle pain termed 'claudication'. As a result of claudication, subjects' ability to exercise is greatly reduced affecting their quality of life. Although many treatment options for patients with PAD exist, exercise training is an effective and low-cost means of improving functional ability and quality of life. Currently, there are limited specific recommendations to assist the exercise prescription and programming of these individuals. This review summarises data from 28 exercise training studies conducted in patients with PAD and formulates recommendations based on their results. Exercise training for patients with PAD should involve three training sessions per week comprising 45 minutes of intermittent treadmill walking in a supervised environment for a time period of 20 weeks or more. Encouragement and direction is given to further research aimed at investigating the effectiveness of training programmes in these patients."
