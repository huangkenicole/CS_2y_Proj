      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of the study was to compare the emotional state and strength-velocity parameters of patients with frailty and pre-frailty syndrome undertaking a 12-week training programme.",
        "The study was completed by 36 individuals, including 17 with frailty syndrome (FS) and 19 with pre-frailty syndrome (PFS). The age of the subjects ranged from 63 to 89 years, with a mean 69.2 years (\u00b15.0). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberg's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used. The strength of knee muscles was evaluated. The above tests were conducted at two time points: before the training sessions (T1); and after 12 weeks of regular training sessions (T2).",
        "After completion of the training programme, statistically significant differences in BDI were observed between the PFS and FS groups (especially in somatic symptoms). Following the training, BDI values in the PFS group were significantly lower (fewer depressive symptoms) than in the FS group. The parameter values describing strength capacities of the lower limbs, both at T1 and T2, proved to be higher in the PFS group.",
        "In individuals with pre-frailty and frailty syndrome, the 3-month physical training programme improved the strength parameters of lower limb muscles. An improvement in mood and reduction in depressive symptoms were only observed in the group of subjects with pre-frailty syndrome. Rehabilitation programmes for people with frailty syndrome should include psychotherapeutic activities in addition to physical training in order to improve the psychophysical condition of patients."
