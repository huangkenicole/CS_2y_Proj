        "Several studies reported the efficacy of exercise therapy in hand and wrist tendinopathy. However, no systematic review synthesized the effect of exercise therapy on these patients.",
        "This study aimed to perform a systematic review to summarize evidence if exercise therapy may be considered an effective treatment in conservative management for patients with hand and wrist tendinopathy.",
        "This was a systematic review.",
        "A literature search in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and Embase was conducted from their inception until April 10, 2022. Two independent reviewers included the studies administering exercise therapy in patients with hand and/or wrist tendinopathy in the review and extrapolated the data. Methodological quality was assessed using the framework developed by Murad et al for case reports and case series and the PEDro score for clinical trials.",
        "Seven case reports, 3 case series, and 2 randomized controlled studies were included and methodologically evaluated, obtaining a low score for all the analyzed studies. The total number of included patients in the analyzed studies was 106, of which 54 were female, 13 were male, and 39 were not specified. The type of exercise was widespread and often not really well described: it varies from eccentric forearm training to mobilization with movement, passing through strengthening exercises, grip proprioception training, and self-management exercises according to the McKenzie method. The dosage was often not precise, making it difficult to reproduce the therapeutic proposals. Exercise therapy was always administered together with different treatments; therefore, its efficacy alone is difficult to distinguish, although in some cases, the patients improved pain and functionality.",
        "Evidence on the efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with hand and wrist tendinopathies is limited. Future research is strongly recommended to determine the appropriate dosage of the exercise therapy to determine clinical changes in these patients."
