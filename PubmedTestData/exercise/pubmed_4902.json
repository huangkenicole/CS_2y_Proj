      "AbstractText": [
        "Research in preschool children that investigates the impact of different exercise interventions on physical fitness is limited. This pre-post study was aimed at determining if participation in a nine-month structured multisport program (MSG; n = 38) could enhance physical fitness components compared to a formal exercise program (control group (CG); n = 36) among preschool children. Physical fitness was assessed using standardized tests (the standing long jump, sit and reach, 20 m sprint, sit-ups for 30 s, bent-arm hang, medicine ball throw (MBT), grip strength, 4 \u00d7 10 m shuttle run, and 20 m shuttle run tests). The structured multisport program involved fundamental/gross and fine motor skills and ball game-based exercises twice a week. The control group was free of any programmed exercise except for the obligatory program in kindergartens. A mixed ANOVA demonstrated significant group-by-time interaction effects for the 4 \u00d7 10 m shuttle run, standing long jump, sit-ups, bent-arm hang, grip strength, and sit and reach tests (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There was no significant group-by-time interaction effect for the 20 m sprint test (<i>p</i> = 0.794) or for the 20 m shuttle run test (<i>p</i> = 0.549). Moreover, the MSG and CG performance in the MBT and 20 m shuttle run tests improved to a similar extent from pre- to post-test. Our results indicate that compared to the formal plan, the structured multisport program led to a sustained improvement in physical fitness in healthy 5-to-6-year old children."
