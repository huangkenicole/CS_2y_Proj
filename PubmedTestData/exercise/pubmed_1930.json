        "To consolidate the evidence on the effect of physical exercise on fear of falling in individuals with stroke.",

        "An extensive database search was conducted to identify the randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of physical exercise on fear of falling post-stroke. Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of evidence for each meta-analysis.",
        "Fourteen trials totalling 1211 participants were included in this review. Thirteen of these (1180 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. In the primary analysis, very low-quality evidence suggested that exercise reduced fear of falling post-stroke (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.72). The effect was diminished at three- to six-month follow-up after exercise training ended (SMD -0.09; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.10; high-quality evidence). In the sensitivity analyses, the treatment effect was more pronounced in individuals with a lower baseline Berg balance score (BBS \u226445; SMD 0.53; 95%CI 0.17 to 0.88) and for those trials with exercise frequency of \u22653 sessions per week (SMD 0.70; 95%CI 0.39 to 1.01). Compared with circuit-based training consisting of a combination of walking, balance and strengthening exercises (SMD 0.27; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.63), walking programmes seemed to generate a larger effect on fear of falling (SMD 1.06; 95%CI 0.43 to 1.70).",
        "Physical exercise was beneficial for reducing fear of falling in individuals with stroke, particularly those with poorer balance ability."
