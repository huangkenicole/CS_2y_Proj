        "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of sport rock climbing (SRC) exercises on VO2max, body composition (BC), muscle strength (MS), and muscle endurance (ME) components.",
        "A total of 19 adults participated in this study voluntarily. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups as experimental (EG) and control (CG). While the EG went and did climbing training by using the top-rope method for 60 minutes a day, three days a week for 8 weeks and were not involved in any other formal physical activity programs, the CG did not train and take part in any physical activity during the course of the study. Both of the groups completed pre and post-test in BC, VO2max, MS, and ME between 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0/s. Training intensity was set at 70% of maximal heart rate (HRmax), and the intensity was controlled with HR monitors in each training session.",
        "There was a significant difference between pre and post-tests in BC (percent body fat 16.3%, P<0.01, and mass of body fat 18.4%, P<0.05), VO2max (5.54%, P<0.01), MS and ME parameters (P<0.01, P<0.05) in healthy individuals.",
        "It, therefore, demonstrated that SRC can be used as a type of activity to maintain and/or improve physical fitness in sedentary adults."
