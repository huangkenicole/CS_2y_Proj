        "Cavarretta, DJ, Hall, EE, and Bixby, WR. The effects of increasing training load on affect and perceived exertion. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 16-21, 2022-This study was designed to investigate how affect and ratings of perceived exertion based on repetitions in reserve (RPE/RIR) change as a function of increasing load during a 10 repetition maximum (RM) test. Twenty-nine novice lifters completed a 10RM test for 2 different conditions presented in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. RPE/RIR and affect were assessed immediately after each successful 10RM attempt. RPE/RIR was significantly different at all loads from 50 to 100% 10RM (p < 0.001) with no differences between exercise and exercise load (p = 0.059). RPE/RIR was higher for all lower body exercises compared with upper-body exercises (p < 0.001) but was not different between machine and free-weight exercises (p > 0.344). Affect became less positive only at 100% 10RM compared with all other loads (p < 0.05). Finally, affect was more positive for upper-body exercises compared to lower-body exercises (p = 0.025) and more positive for machines compared to free-weights (p = 0.015). The results of this study suggest that among novice lifters, RPE/RIR increases as load increases during a 10RM and affective valence remains relatively constant but becomes less positive when exercising at maximal intensities (100% 10RM). Further research is needed to replicate these findings and elucidate the effects of different muscles used (e.g., upper vs. lower body) and modality of exercise (e.g., machine vs. free-weight) on RPE/RIR and affect among both novice and experienced lifters."
