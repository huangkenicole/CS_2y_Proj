        "BACKGROUND This study investigated how whole-body vibration (WBV), exercise, and their interactions influence core muscle activity in healthy young adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-three healthy young adults (8 males and 15 females; age: 21.87\u00b12.33 years) participated in the study. The activities of muscle multifidi (MM), rectus abdominis muscle (RM), erector spinae (ES), abdominis obliquus externus (AOE), and abdominis obliquus internus (AOI) were measured through surface electromyography (sEMG) while participants were performing 4 different exercise forms under 3 WBV conditions (condition 1: 5 Hz, 2 mm; condition 2: 10 Hz, 2 mm; and condition 3: 15 Hz, 2 mm) and a no-WBV condition in single experimental sessions. RESULTS The WBV frequency of 15 Hz is the best vibration stimulation for core muscles in all of the exercises (P<0.05). Single bridge is a better exercise for RM and AOE (P<0.05) compared with other exercises, and crunches is the best exercise for MM, AOI, and ES (P<0.05). Significant interaction effect was observed in different frequencies and exercises (P>0.05) except for AOI (F=0.990, P=0.378). CONCLUSIONS High vibration frequencies can lead to enhanced exercise benefits within an appropriate frequency range, and different exercises have diverse effects on various muscles. Single bridge and crunches are appropriate exercise forms for lumbar-abdominal muscles."
