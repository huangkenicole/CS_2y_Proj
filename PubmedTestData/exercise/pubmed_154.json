        "This study aimed to investigate the basic data on the effectiveness and safety of the system in healthy subjects using an immersive virtual reality (VR) exercise system specialized for therapeutic exercise therapy during dialysis or hospital use. A total of 15 healthy adult subjects performed four exercises, namely lifting and rowing exercises using VR and each movement exercise without VR (control). The simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) was administered pre- and post-operatively to assess for VR sickness. Blood pressure, heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exhaustion, Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition Japanese version, and muscle activity (iEMG) were measured using electromyography. The correlation between changes in mood states and HR or iEMG results was examined. The SSQ measured post-VR exercise was 11.2 (18.7-7.5) and 11.2 (7.5-29.9) points in the lifting and rowing VR, respectively. The HR in lifting (VR, 82.5 <b>\u00b1</b> 12.7 vs control, 71.6 <b>\u00b1</b> 10.6 bpm, <i>P</i><0.05) and rowing (VR, 94.2 <b>\u00b1</b> 13.1 vs control, 83.5 <b>\u00b1</b> 12.0, <i>P</i><0.05) with VR exercise was significantly higher than in control. No significant differences were observed between the other variables. There was a positive correlation between HR and negative mood in the lifting VR condition (r=0.64, <i>P</i><0.05), but not in the control group. Contrastingly, there was a positive correlation between iEMG and negative mood in rowing control (r=0.56), but not VR. Safety was confirmed, with no VR sickness or discontinuation of the system. Exercise therapy using VR resulted in a higher exercise load. This VR system has the potential for additional effective intradialytic exercises and hospital use."
