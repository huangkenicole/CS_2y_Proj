        "The study's purpose was to assess the effectiveness of a short-duration three-times-weekly high-load resistive exercise program on preventing deterioration in neuromuscular function after prolonged bed rest.",
        "Twenty-four male subjects performed high-load resistive exercise (n = 8), high-load resistive exercise with whole-body vibration (n = 9), or no exercise (control, n = 9) during 60-d head-down tilt bed rest as part of the 2nd Berlin Bed Rest Study. Peak countermovement jump power and height, sit-to-stand performance, sprint time over 15 and 30 m, and leg press one-repetition maximum were measured before and after bed rest.",
        "The exercise interventions were capable of ameliorating losses of peak countermovement jump power (P < 0.001) and height (P < 0.001), deterioration of sit-to-stand time from 45-cm (P = 0.034) and 30-cm (P < 0.001) sitting positions, increases of 15-m (P = 0.037) and 30-m (P = 0.005) sprint time, and losses of leg press one-repetition maximum (P < 0.001).",
        "The short-duration (6-min time under tension per training session) exercise countermeasure program performed three times a week was capable of reducing the effect of prolonged bed rest on many neuromuscular function measures."
