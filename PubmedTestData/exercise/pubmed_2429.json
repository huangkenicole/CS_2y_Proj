        "The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes between a diabetes exercise training program using combined aerobic and high-force eccentric resistance exercise and a program of aerobic exercise only.",
        "Fifteen participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participated in a 16-week supervised exercise training program: 7 (mean age=50.7 years, SD=6.9) in a combined aerobic and eccentric resistance exercise program (AE/RE group) and 8 (mean age=58.5 years, SD=6.2) in a program of aerobic exercise only (AE group). Outcome measures included thigh lean tissue and intramuscular fat (IMF), glycosylated hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI), and 6-minute walk distance.",
        "Both groups experienced decreases in mean glycosylated hemoglobin after training (AE/RE group: -0.59% [95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.5 to 0.28]; AE group: -0.31% [95% CI=-0.60 to -0.03]), with no significant between-group differences. There was an interaction between group and time with respect to change in thigh lean tissue cross-sectional area, with the AE/RE group gaining more lean tissue (AE/RE group: 15.1 cm(2) [95% CI=7.6 to 22.5]; AE group: -5.6 cm(2) [95% CI=-10.4 to 0.76]). Both groups experienced decreases in mean thigh IMF cross-sectional area (AE/RE group: -1.2 cm(2) [95% CI=-2.6 to 0.26]; AE group: -2.2 cm(2) [95% CI=-3.5 to -0.84]) and increases in 6-minute walk distance (AE/RE group: 45.5 m [95% CI=7.5 to 83.6]; AE group: 29.9 m [95% CI=-7.7 to 67.5]) after training, with no between-group differences. There was an interaction between group and time with respect to change in BMI, with the AE/RE group experiencing a greater decrease in BMI.",
        "Significant improvements in long-term glycemic control, thigh composition, and physical performance were demonstrated in both groups after participating in a 16-week exercise program.",
        "in the AE/RE group demonstrated additional improvements in thigh lean tissue and BMI. Improvements in thigh lean tissue may be important in this population as a means to increase resting metabolic rate, protein reserve, exercise tolerance, and functional mobility."
