        "Shaw, MP, Andersen, V, S\u00e6terbakken, AH, Paulsen, G, Samn\u00f8y, LE, and Solstad, TEJ. Contemporary training practices of Norwegian powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2544-2551, 2022-The aim of this study was to explore the contemporary training practices of Norwegian powerlifters. One hundred twenty-four Norwegian powerlifters completed an electronic questionnaire that surveyed their current training practices with a focus on 2 areas: (a) training content and (b) training design and monitoring. One hundred seventeen respondents met the inclusion criteria, and the sample included World, European, and Norwegian champions. Where data were dichotomized, chi-square tests were used. The most frequently reported (58.1%) category of training was 5-6 times per week, with no statistically significant associations between levels of competitors (international vs. noninternational) (X 2 (1) = 0.414, p = 0.52). The most frequently reported load used in training was 71-80% 1 repetition maximum. The majority of Norwegian (76.9%) powerlifters train with variable resistance, with those competing internationally more likely to use elastic bands (X 2 (1) = 4.473, p = 0.034). 32.5% of respondents reported that they included strength training exercises in their training. Norwegian powerlifters' training differs from practices previously identified in the literature, with a higher prevalence of elastic resistance, particularly for those competing internationally, and a decreased use of strength training exercises at all levels. Norwegian powerlifters train frequently (5 or more times per week) and with submaximal loads."
