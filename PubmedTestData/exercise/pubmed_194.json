        "Several researchers have evaluated the impact of exercise training on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few studies have evaluated the impact of concurrent training (aerobic and resisted exercise) on non-dialysis days on the functional capacity and quality of life (QOL) of such patients. Our current study evaluated the effects of concurrent training on functional capacity and QOL of patients with CKD.",
        "Forty-three patients, aged \u2265 25 years, were recruited in this randomized study. They were divided into intervention and control groups (22 per group). The intervention group received concurrent aerobic and resistance exercises (three sessions per week for twelve weeks on alternative days). The control group continued their regular lifestyle practices and medical treatment without any exercise intervention. Before and after twelve weeks of training, the participant's functional capacity and quality of life (QOL) were measured.",
        "Compared to the control group, the intervention group displayed a significant improvement in the distance walked in the 6-minute walk test and sit-to-stand test (STS1/s and STS-60) with p<0.001; furthermore, a significant improvement was observed in physical function, body pain, general health, role functioning/physical, vitality, and social functioning (p<0.05) of QOL assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire.",
        "The twelve-week concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training had a positive impact on functional capacity and QOL in CKD patients. Concurrent exercise training should be recommended as an interventional modality in physical therapy and rehabilitation protocols in CKD patients."
