        "This study explored the effect of running exercises at low [30% heart rate reserve (HRR)] and moderate (60%HRR) intensities on cognitive performances in individuals with intellectual disability (ID).",
        "Participants performed randomly reaction time (RT) tests: visual RT [simple RT (SRT) and choice RT (CRT)], auditory SRT (ASRT) and working memory (WM) (Corsi test) before and after the exercises.",
        "The results showed that after both exercises, SRT decreased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both groups with higher extent (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 60%HRR compared with 30%HRR. CRT decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), similarly, after the both exercises in both groups with higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) extent in the intellectual disability group (IDG). ASRT decreased significantly, at 30%HRR, in IDG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and in control group (CG) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with greater extent in IDG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). At 60%HRR, ASRT decreased significantly in both groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with greater extent in IDG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The \u0394ASRT% was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher at 30%HRR compared with 60%HRR in IDG. In CG, no significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.21) difference was reported between intensities. The Corsi forward and the Corsi backward scores increased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in both groups after both intensities with higher extent in IDG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).",
        "Our results suggest that low and moderate running exercises improve similarly simple and choice visual RT as well as WM in individuals with ID. Furthermore, low-intensity exercise could be more appropriate to enhance ASRT compared the moderate one in these individuals. Therefore, low-intensity exercise seems to be an efficient strategy to improve cognitive performances in individuals with ID."
