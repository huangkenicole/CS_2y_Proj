        "Acromegaly causes numerous functional limitations that negatively impact patients' performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and contribute to the deterioration of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Thus, the purpose of the present case study was to evaluate the effect of therapist-oriented home rehabilitation (TOHR) for a patient with acromegaly.",
        "We report the case of a 53-year-old man who was diagnosed with primary acromegaly 17 years ago. He complained of difficulties performing tasks that involved his hands, pain in the lower limbs, and fatigue when he climbed a few flights of stairs. Although he performed ADLs independently, he reported some difficulties or discomfort when performing them.",
        "The patient underwent a booklet-guided physical exercise program that lasted two months (three times per week, 60 minutes per session). The activities included overall stretching, muscle strengthening, and endurance exercises, along with aerobic conditioning through functional circuit training. After two months of exercise, he reported improved HRQoL as assessed with the Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire, with increases in quadriceps muscle strength and 6-min walking distance. However, none of these benefits remained when the patient was assessed after a 1-month washout period.",
        "This study showed that patients with acromegaly may benefit markedly from TOHR, which could provide a novel therapeutic approach as an adjunct to hormone control therapy."
