        "The effects of dance on improving the symptoms of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is well documented. Augmented reality devices, such as Google Glass, may be used to implement dance interventions to improve mobility and balance.",
        "To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of a mobile dance intervention and obtain preliminary efficacy estimates for assessment of the research protocol.",
        "Seven participants with PD were asked to use Google Glass preloaded with Moving Through Dance modules for three weeks. Changes in motor functions (balance, mobility) and non-motor functions (mood, quality of life) were evaluated before and after completion of the intervention.",
        "Recruitment rate was 50%, retention rate was 100%, and adherence to usage was 95%. The intervention was safe and accepted by participants. Use of Moving Through Glass improved mobility with a cognitive load (F(1, 5)\u202f=\u202f10.76; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). However, there were no significant changes to the participants' balance scores, quality of life or mood.",
        "The outcomes of this pilot study suggest that Moving Through Glass, as a mobile dance intervention, may be a safe way to increase physical activity through dance in individuals with PD. Its efficacy should be investigated in a properly powered randomized controlled trial."
