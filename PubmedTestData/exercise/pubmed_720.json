        "<i>Purpose</i>: This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of moderate intensity elastic band exercise (EBE) on functional fitness and blood pressure parameters in the elderly. <i>Methods</i>: 27 healthy older adults were randomly assigned to an exercise group (<i>n</i> = 15, age: 75.1 \u00b1 1.4 years) and a control group (<i>n</i> = 12, age: 72.3 \u00b1 1.4 years). Participants performed EBE for 60 min, three times a week, over the course of three months. The EBE consisted of incremental resistance and aerobic exercises designed to improve whole body fitness. Functional fitness and resting cardiovascular parameters were assessed before and after the exercise training program. <i>Results</i>: Grip strength, sit and reach, and one-leg stance improved significantly in the exercise group, while no significant improvements were found in chair stand and timed up and go (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Cardiovascular parameters including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure significantly decreased in the exercise group relative to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions</i>: Findings of the present study suggest that safe, inexpensive, and easily accessible EBE program with circuit training components play a significant role in improving upper and lower body fitness, as well as cardiovascular fitness, in the elderly."
