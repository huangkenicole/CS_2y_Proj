        "Although muscle strength training is a prevalent treatment for patients with functional ankle instability (FAI), previous investigations on the efficacy have yielded conflicting results.",
        "This study aims to compare the efficacy of 6-week isokinetic strength training and Thera-Band strength training on improving ankle strength, dynamic balance ability, and function in individuals with FAI.",
        "Fifty-two FAI patients were randomized into two treatment groups: an isokinetic strength training (IST, n = 26) group and a Thera-Band resistance training (TBT, n = 26) group. The IST group engaged in isokinetic concentric strength training with inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion, whereas the TBT group engaged in progressive resistance training with Thera-Band three times per week for six weeks. Before and after the training, an isokinetic concentric strength test of the involved ankle joint, Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) function assessment were performed.",
        "After six weeks of intervention, the strength of inversion and eversion was significantly improved in both the IST and TBT groups (p < 0.05), with the IST group exhibiting a significant (p < 0.05) improvement when compared to the TBT group. The SEBT and CAIT results were significantly (p < 0.05) improved in the IST group compared to the TBT group.",
        "The six-week of isokinetic strength training is more effective than the Thera-Band progressive resistance training in improving the physical function of FAI patients.",
        "This randomized controlled clinical trial has been registered in the China Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100044444) https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=ChiCTR2100044444."
