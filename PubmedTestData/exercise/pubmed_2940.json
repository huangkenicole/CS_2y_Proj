        "Over the last few decades, the quality of care and the quality of life of nursing home (NH) residents have significantly improved, but insufficient physical activity and social involvement still represent substantial challenges in modern nursing facilities. The main aim of this research was to assess the influence of physical exercises with dance movement therapy (DMT) elements on strength and other fitness components of the upper limbs and the overall functional performance of NH residents in wheelchairs compared to standard exercise programmes and usual care.",
        "The study participants were persons aged 68-85 who lived in NH and used manual wheelchairs as a primary means of mobility. Individuals meeting the inclusion criteria were assigned to one of the three groups: Group 1, basic exercise/BE group (n\u2009=\u200955); group 2, physical exercises with elements of dance movement therapy/PED group (n\u2009=\u200955); and group 3, control group, usual care/CO group (n\u2009=\u200955). The intervention for both exercising groups consisted of a 30-min session, two times a week, for 12\u2009weeks in total. Outcome assessments were performed at baseline, 12\u2009weeks after baseline (immediately after the intervention) and 24\u2009weeks after baseline (12\u2009weeks after the intervention). The main outcome was observed for hand grip strength (HGS), while secondary outcomes for box and block test (BBT), arm curl test (ACT), back scratch test (BS), chair sit-and-reach (CSR), peak expiratory flow (PEF), Barthel Index (BI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the range of motion of the shoulder.",
        "Prior to the start of the exercise programmes, all the tested groups were homogeneous. After 12\u2009weeks the PED group presented higher statistically significant scores in HGS<sub>L</sub>, BBT, ACT, BS, CSR, BI, BBS: p\u2009<\u20090.001 and HGS<sub>R</sub>: p\u2009=\u20090.01, compared to the BE group. After 24\u2009weeks from the beginning of the intervention the comparison between the PED group and the BE group showed statistically significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in favour of PED group in almost all areas: HGS<sub>R</sub>, HGS<sub>L</sub>, BBT: ACT, PEF, BS, CSR, BI. After 12 and 24\u2009weeks both intervention groups performed better than the CO in all measures except for Katz ADL and shoulder extension.",
        "Twelve weeks of physical exercises had beneficial effects on the strength and fitness of the upper limbs and overall functional performance in both exercise groups. This study demonstrated that group performing physical exercises with elements of DMT obtained statistically better scores in the majority of analysed domains than other groups.",
        "The study was registered in the Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry (Registration Number - SLCTR/2018/014 - Date of Registration 16/05/2018. Accessed on https://slctr.lk/trials/1045 )."
