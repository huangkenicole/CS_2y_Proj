      "AbstractText": [
        "Arterial stiffness, an age-dependent phenomenon, is improved with exercise, which in turn may prevent cardiovascular diseases in women. However, there is a lack of consolidated information on the impact of exercise on arterial stiffness among healthy women. The aim of this review was to (i) analyse the effect of exercise on arterial stiffness in healthy young, middle-aged, and older women, and (ii) recommend types, intensity, and frequency for each age group. Database searches on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus were conducted using PRISMA guidelines until September 2022. The keywords were: exercise, women/female, and arterial stiffness. The inclusion criteria were: healthy women, supervised exercise, and arterial stiffness measures. Study quality and bias were assessed using the PEDro scale. Fifty-one papers were classified into young (n = 15), middle-aged (n = 14), and older (n = 22) women. Improvements in arterial stiffness were observed among: young women (Pulse Wave Velocity, PWV: 4.9-6.6 m/s), following an 8-week high-intensity aerobic (3 days/week) or hypoxic high-intensity interval training; middle-aged women (PWV: 5.1-7.9 m/s), aerobic exercise with moderate intensity or stretching exercise at \"moderate to heavy\" (Borg Scale), 20-30 s per site, 10 s of rest interval for 30 min; and for older women (PWV: 7.9-15.6 m/s), resistance training at light intensity, aerobic exercise at any intensity, or a combination of the two exercises. This review shows that arterial stiffness increases with age in healthy women and has an inverse relationship with exercise intensity. Therefore, when prescribing exercise to improve arterial stiffness, age and arterial stiffness measures should be accounted for."
