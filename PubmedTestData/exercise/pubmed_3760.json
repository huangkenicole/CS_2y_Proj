        "Exercise interventions benefit cancer patients. However, only low numbers of patients adhere to these interventions. This review aimed to identify predictors of exercise intervention adherence in patients with cancer, during and after multimodality cancer treatment.",
        "A literature search was performed using electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane) to identify relevant papers published before February 1, 2017. Papers reporting randomized controlled trials, conducted in adult cancer patients who participated in an exercise intervention during and/or after multimodality cancer treatment, and providing outcome of factors predicting exercise adherence were included. Papers were assessed for methodological quality by using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale.",
        "The search identified 720 potentially relevant papers, of which 15 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In these 15 studies, 2279 patients were included and 1383 of these patients were randomized to an exercise intervention. During cancer treatment, the factors predicting exercise adherence were as follows: location of the rehabilitation center, extensive exercise history, high motivation for exercise, and fewer exercise limitations. After cancer treatment, factors that predicted adherence were as follows: less extensive surgery, low alcohol consumption, high previous exercise adherence, family support, feedback by trainers, and knowledge and skills of exercise. Methodological quality of the included papers was rated \"high\".",
        "The most prominent predictors of adherence to exercise interventions were location of the rehabilitation center, extensive exercise history, high motivation for exercise, and fewer exercise limitations. To increase the number of cancer patients who will benefit, these results should be considered into the development and implementation of future exercise interventions."
