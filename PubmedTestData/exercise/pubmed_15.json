        "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different types of exercise interventions for treating sarcopenia compared to no specific treatment, a minimal intervention (e.g., education), or another active treatment (nutritional supplements). A review was conducted of the recent English literature searching PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review, presenting the results of 671 sarcopenic patients. The exercise interventions were resistance training (four studies), a multimodal program (five studies, encompassing resistance training and additional exercises such as aerobic exercises, flexibility, balance and strength training), and a whole body vibration program (one study). Results show that exercise interventions could have beneficial effects in improving muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in 3\u00a0months of intervention. Resistance training, added to an adequate nutrition and aerobic exercise, appeared to deliver the most positive outcome after 3\u00a0months of intervention. Types of exercise and dose-response parameters of exercise eliciting improvement warrant further investigation. Due to the significant heterogeneity in clinical trials, the current evidence provides limited guidance. Well-designed studies evaluating exercise interventions are needed before treatment guidelines can be developed."
