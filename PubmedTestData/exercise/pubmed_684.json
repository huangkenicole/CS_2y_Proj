        "Intervention programs designed to improve cognitive ability in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have often focused on physical exercise as a means to improve traditional measures of cognition, with mixed success. Individuals with MCI show high levels of intraindividual variability (IIV) in response speed, and IIV may be sensitive to intervention-related changes. The current study evaluated if participants who participated in a physical activity intervention (aerobic or resistance training) showed a reduction in IIV, compared to a balance and tone control group.",
        "This study was a secondary analysis of the EXercise for Cognition and Everyday Living (EXCEL) Study. Women Aged 70-80 years with probable MCI (<i>n</i> = 86) participated in a 6-month randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effects of different physical exercises on cognitive ability. Participants completed 1-back, task switching, and spatial working memory tasks at baseline, 13 weeks (midpoint) and upon completion of the program.",
        "Analyses were conducted following both the intent-to-treat principle and complier average casual effect (CACE) modeling. Participants in the intervention group who complied with the program showed reduced IIV on task switching in the CACE models. The intent-to-treat analyses were all nonsignificant.",
        "Physical exercise resulted in improved IIV in older adults with probable MCI, showing that IIV is modifiable by lifestyle engagement. IIV may be a useful complementary index of cognitive plasticity particularly among those with cognitive impairment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)."
