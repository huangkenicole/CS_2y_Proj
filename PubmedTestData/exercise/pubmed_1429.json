        "Dual-tasking performance (DTP) is critical for most real-life activities. Interventions to improve DTP would be clinically valuable. This study investigated effects of single-bouts of two different aerobic exercises on the performance of Extended cognitive Timed-Up and Go (ETUGcog), a dual-task test involving concurrent performance of a physical (ETUG) and cognitive (counting backwards serial 7\u2009s) task. Twenty-two adults performed single bouts of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity exercise (MIE), separately. ETUGcog was performed before, immediately following, and 24\u2009hours after each exercise. Number and rates of correct serial 7\u2009s were significantly higher 24\u2009hours after HIIT, with no difference in times to complete ETUGcog. No such effects were found for MIE. Single bouts of HIIT could provide delayed improvements in DTP."
