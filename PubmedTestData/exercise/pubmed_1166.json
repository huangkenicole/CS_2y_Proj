      "AbstractText": [
        "In recent years, there has been a burgeoning amount of evidence-based scientific data demonstrating the benefit of exercise during and following cancer treatment. This compelling evidence has resulted in major stakeholders in cancer management, including the American College of Sports Medicine, American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Cancer Society, Oncology Nursing Society, and the Commission on Cancer, advocating exercise as an integral component of cancer care. Despite the acknowledgment of exercise as an essential component, it remains virtually absent in routine cancer treatment. This article discusses the role of exercise in cancer treatment utilizing a community-based program. The rationale presented is that a scalable and replicable standard of care model is a plausible avenue to assimilate exercise into routine oncology practice."
