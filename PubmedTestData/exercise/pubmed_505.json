        "Physical activity interventions such as resistance training (RT) and multicomponent (MCT) exercise training are known to improve functional mobility and reduce the risk of disability among the elderly. Less evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of such exercises to improve metabolic risk factors for age related conditions. This study aimed to compare the effects of MCT and RT programs on metabolic health parameters in healthy elderly.",
        "Twenty one and 18 subjects completed a 12-week MCT and RT program respectively. Before and after intervention, body composition, functional ability, aerobic fitness and metabolic health parameters including lipid profile, inflammatory markers, glucose metabolism, hormones and growth markers were examined. Circulating concentrations of epidermal growth factor increased significantly in the MCT group from 35.8 \u00b1 29.4 to 56.1 \u00b1 35 pg/ml. High molecular weight adiponectin decreased significantly in the RT group from 4.7 \u00b1 2.9 to 4.2 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcg/ml (p=0.03). No other biochemical parameter was significantly altered within either group. A significant between group difference was found for both ferritin (p=0.02) and EGF (p=0.01), with concentrations of ferritin decreasing in the MCT group and increasing in the RT group and concentration of EGF increasing in the MCT group yet decreasing in the RT group. The MCT program improved results of functional tests including chair stand and habitual walking speed. Present findings suggest that although both the MCT and RT interventions were enough to produce functional and physical benefits, different training programs and/or exercise dose are required to improve metabolic health in healthy older adults."
