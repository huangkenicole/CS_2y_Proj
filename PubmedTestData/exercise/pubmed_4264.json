        "Scoliosis is a common medical condition in children and adolescents, particularly girls. It is accompanied by disorders of multiple systems and organs, especially the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, which significantly affects general physical capacity.",
        "This study sought to assess lung function, chest mobility, and physical fitness in scoliotic girls undergoing rehabilitation.",
        "The study involved a group of 30 young females aged 14-16 who were inpatients at the rehabilitation ward of the Regional Paediatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Jastrzebie Zdr\u00f3j receiving treatment for idiopathic scoliosis. A baseline physiotherapeutic assessment of patients' posture was followed by a spirometry test to determine selected parameters of lung function. Additionally, selected physical fitness tests were carried out. After 4-5 weeks, respiratory system function was re-examined and the fitness tests were also repeated. In the period between the examinations and tests, the study participants underwent specialised physical rehabilitation in the form of asymmetric respiratory exercise therapy developed by Dobosiewicz (a modified Lehnert-Schroth method).",
        "The study results indicate a statistically significant increase in each measured parameter of respiratory system function effected by rehabilitation according to asymmetric respiratory exercise therapy in the study group of scoliotic girls. Chest mobility parameters and fitness scores also improved in a statistically significant manner.",
        "Remedial gymnastics in the form of asymmetric respiratory exercise therapy developed by Dobosiewicz considerably improved all parameters of respiratory function and chest mobility in the study group of girls with idiopathic scoliosis. The remedial exercises highly significantly improved chest mobility and fitness scores in the scoliotic girls."
