        "To develop and validate a behavioural driving model for adherence to home-based cardiac rehabilitation exercise in patients with chronic heart failure, and to explain the potential driving mechanism of social support on exercise adherence.",
        "Despite the benefits of home-based cardiac rehabilitation exercise, adherence among patients with chronic heart failure remains suboptimal. Several factors contributing to adherence have been confirmed; however, the specific pathway mechanisms by which these factors impact exercise adherence have not been thoroughly explored.",
        "An exploratory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in this study.",
        "A total of 226 patients with chronic heart failure were recruited using convenience sampling. Quantitative data were collected using a series of self-report questionnaires. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to verify multiple pathways. Subsequently, 12 patients with chronic heart failure were drawn from the quantitative stage. The interview data were thematically analysed. This study followed the Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) guidelines (Appendix S1).",
        "Perceived social support had a direct positive predictive effect on exercise adherence. Importantly, exercise self-efficacy and exercise fear played a chain-mediating role between perceived social support and exercise adherence. As a result of the qualitative phase, scale, tightness and homogeneity of social support networks emerged as potential drivers of the effectiveness of social support on exercise adherence.",
        "This study reveals a potential pathway mechanism for social support to improve adherence to home-based cardiac rehabilitation exercises. Social support network plays a crucial role in the effect of social support on exercise adherence.",
        "To enhance exercise adherence in home-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with chronic heart failure, establishing a social support network is recommended. This strategy has the potential to promote exercise self-efficacy and alleviate exercise fear.",
