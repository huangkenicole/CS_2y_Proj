        "The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res Method (MM) on pain and disability related to low back pain (LBP), compared to a program of heat, massage and exercise, and to understand the meaning of the bodily experience with the MM.",
        "Mixed methods convergent parallel design, combining an equivalent randomized clinical trial with a qualitative phenomenological approach. Sixty-one participants aged 18-65\u2009years with chronic non-specific LBP lasting more than 3\u2009months. Patients were randomized into two groups: the MM group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200929) and the comparison group (CG) who received heat, massage plus flexibility and strengthening exercises (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200931). MM and CG participants underwent 10 one-hour physical therapy sessions over a 5-week period and were evaluated three times: pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up at 6\u2009weeks after the end of treatment.",
        "Both groups reported positive effects on LBP . MM group showed superior effects in pain relief in the short term (Cohen's <i>D</i> 0.80; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.004). Participants interpreted the interaction with the MM as a teaching-learning process that allowed body awareness.",
        "Both treatment were similarly beneficial but MM had superior effects on pain in the short term. MM is perceived by the participants as a teaching-learning process focused on body awareness that facilitate effective management of LBP."
