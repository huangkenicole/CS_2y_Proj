        "A total of 16 papers were identified, with recurrent themes of physical activity, exercise, mobility and leg elevation emerging. The evidence for the efficacy of compression therapy in preventing recurrence is substantial and is not discussed here.",
        "There is some evidence that increasing physical activity, improving mobility and foot exercises may be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence. The evidence on the benefits of leg elevation on recurrence prevention is unclear and further research is needed."
