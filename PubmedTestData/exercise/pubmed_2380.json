        "To (1) describe which strength training exercise descriptors are reported in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) rehabilitation research, and (2) compare the current standards of reporting ACLR strength training exercise descriptors to international best-practice strength training guidelines.",
        "Scoping review.",
        "We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Academic Search, ERIC, Health Source: Nursing, Health Source: Consumer, MasterFILE, and Africa-Wide Information databases.",
        "We included level I to IV studies of ACLR rehabilitation programs with 1 or more reported strength training exercise descriptors. We used a predefined list of 19 exercise descriptors, based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise recommendations, the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT), and the Toigo and Boutellier exercise descriptor framework.",
        "Completeness and the standard of reporting exercise descriptors in ACLR rehabilitation programs were assessed by means of international best-practice strength training standards.",
        "We extracted data on 117 exercises from 41 studies. A median of 7 of the 19 possible exercise descriptors were reported (range, 3-16). Reporting of specific exercise descriptors varied across studies, from 95% (name of the strength training exercise) to 5% (exercise aim, exercise order). On average, 46%, 35%, and 43% of the exercise descriptors included in the ACSM, CERT, and Toigo and Boutellier guidelines were reported, respectively.",
        "Key exercise descriptors for muscle strength gains are not reported in studies on ACLR rehabilitation. Only the exercise name, number of exercises, frequency, and experimental period were reported in most of the studies. <i>J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(2):100-112.
