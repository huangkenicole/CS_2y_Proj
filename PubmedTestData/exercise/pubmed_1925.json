      "AbstractText": [
        "The combined effects of cross-body stretching and dorsal glide mobilization have not been examined previously, although both stretching and mobilization maneuvers are effective for improving shoulder range of motion (ROM). Thus, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the effects of stretching with mobilization (SWM) on glenohumeral (GH) internal rotation (IR) and horizontal adduction (HA) ROM.",
        "Forty individuals with GH IR deficits were randomized to perform simultaneous combined cross-body stretching and dorsal glide mobilization (SWM group, comprising 10 male and 10 female patients) or cross-body stretching alone (stretching group, comprising 10 male and 10 female patients). GH IR ROM, HA ROM, and shoulder mobility were assessed before and immediately following interventions. Group and time differences were analyzed using 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance.",
        "Greater changes in GH IR ROM (6\u00b0, P < .001), HA ROM (10\u00b0, P < .001), and shoulder mobility (-2 cm, P = .018) were observed in the SWM group than in the stretching group, although significant increases were observed in GH IR ROM (SWM group, P < .001; stretching group, P < .001), HA ROM (SWM group, P < .001; stretching group, P = .042), and shoulder mobility (SWM group, P < .001; stretching group, P < .001) after both interventions.",
        "This study shows that SWM could be a useful exercise for shoulder ROM recovery in individuals with GH IR deficits."
