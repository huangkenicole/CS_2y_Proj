        "Family caregivers to cancer patients are at risk for physical and psychological morbidity as a direct result of being in the caregiver role. Exercise as an intervention to support caregiver health and well-being has been tested in other caregiver populations; however, no randomized controlled trials testing the effects of an aerobic and resistance training program have been conducted where cancer caregivers only have participated.",
        "To examine the effects of a 12-week exercise program on quality of life (Short Form 36 v2), psychological outcomes, physical activity levels, and physical fitness in caregivers to cancer patients.",
        "Seventy-seven caregivers were randomized to either an exercise intervention or wait-list control. Two participants in the exercise arm dropped out immediately after their baseline assessment. Outcome data for n = 77 participants were analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis with linear mixed models.",
        "Significant group by time interaction effects were detected for exercise on the mental health component score of quality of life, self-reported weekly exercise levels, and the six-minute walk test. Small to medium effect sizes were detected on several outcomes including physical health component of quality of life (d = 0.36), mental health component of quality of life (d = 0.74), depression (d = 0.41), anxiety (d = 0.35), physical activity levels (d = 0.80), and the six-minute walk test (d = 0.21).",
        "The findings suggest that exercise may improve health and well-being and could be considered as an additional type of support offered to cancer caregivers.",
