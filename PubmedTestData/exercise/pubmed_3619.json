        "This study examined the effects of 12\u00a0weeks of sprint interval training (SIT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake, VO<sub>2peak</sub>), body composition and physical activity enjoyment in overweight young women. Sixty-six participants (age 21.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0years, body mass index (BMI) 26.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0 kg\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>, body fat percentage 39.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%) were randomly assigned to non-exercise control (CON), thrice-weekly SIT (80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 s \"all-out\" cycling interspersed with 9 s rest), and HIIT (4\u00a0min cycling at 90% VO<sub>2peak</sub> followed with 3\u00a0min recovery for ~ 60\u00a0min) or MICT (~ 65\u00a0min continuous cycling at 60% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) with equivalent mechanical work (200/300\u00a0KJ). Compared to the CON group, all three training groups had significant and similar improvements in VO<sub>2peak</sub> (~ +20%, <i>d</i> =\u00a02.5-3.4), fat mass (~ -10%, <i>d</i> =\u00a01.3-2.1) and body fat percentage (~ -5%, <i>d</i> =\u00a01.0-1.1) after a 12-week intervention. Similar high levels of enjoyment were observed among groups for most (~70%) of the training sessions. The findings suggest that the three training regimes are equally enjoyable and could result in similar improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition in overweight/obese young women, but SIT is a more time-efficient strategy."
