        "Stroke survivors are frequently physically inactive. However, evidence of the effectiveness of active physiotherapy on physical activity level in stroke survivors is scarce.",
        "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement, covering electronic searches from inception to March 16, 2022. Participants: Stroke survivors living in the community. Intervention: Any active physiotherapy, that is, involving exercises that require voluntary effort. Outcome measure: Objective and subjective physical activity level.",
        "Of 5590 identified references, 25 randomized controlled trials were eligible, and 21 had available data. The random-effects meta-analysis resulted in a small, significant effect size in favor of active physiotherapy measured using objective or subjective tools (21 studies, 1834 participants, standardized mean difference, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.04-0.40]; heterogeneity <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=65%), and a medium significant effect when objective tools were used (9 studies, 424 participants, standardized mean differences, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.03-0.92]; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=73%). Meta-regression showed that 35% of the variance in trial outcome was explained by the measurement tool (objective or subjective) and 23% by age. None of the variances were associated with a specific dosage in terms of frequency, time, exercise duration, or the severity of the disability.",
        "Active physiotherapy seems to increase objective physical activity in community-dwelling stroke survivors. However, the evidence is of very low certainty.",
