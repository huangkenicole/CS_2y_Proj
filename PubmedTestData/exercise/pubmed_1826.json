        "The appropriateness of neuromuscular training exercises across different age groups has not yet been investigated, particularly in younger children. The purpose of this study was to determine which neuromuscular training exercises can be performed with proper neutral alignment in various age groups.",
        "Seven exercises were selected for evaluation in children ranging from 8 to 17 years of age who were recruited from schools and youth sports organisations. Participants completed two trials of each exercise and were judged on maintaining neutral body alignment after receiving visual/verbal instruction on the first trial and feedback cues on the second trial. Three evaluators judged each exercise, which was deemed as correct when at least two evaluators agreed that neutral alignment was maintained. Comparisons were made across ages and between sex using the \u03c7\u00b2 test or Fisher's exact test. The proportions of participants who performed the exercise correctly were also compared before and after feedback cues were provided.",
        "A total of 360 participants were evaluated (8-11 years: 165, 54% female; 12-15 years: 136, 40% female, 16-17 years: 59, 53% female). There were no significant differences in performance across ages and sex for nearly all exercises. The majority of children were not able to complete the exercises with proper alignment. The use of feedback cues significantly increased the proportion of participants who correctly completed the exercise (p<0.001).",
        "These results demonstrate the importance of training coaches and physical education teachers to provide cues that reinforce proper technique during anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention exercises. Children should perform common neuromuscular training exercises with feedback on proper technique.",
