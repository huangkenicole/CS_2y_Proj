        "We aimed to explore (i) the impact that a motivated walking program had on youth with epilepsy and (ii) the facilitators and barriers to implementing and sustaining the program.",
        "Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews with the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial to study the effect of enhanced physical activity on youth with epilepsy. Participants had active epilepsy and were 8-14\u202fyears at recruitment. All wore an activity tracker for a year and received coaching via phone calls during the first six months to encourage reaching a step goal, which they then attempted to maintain independently for the following six months. Nine participants and one parent per child were separately interviewed at six months. Eleven participants including the original nine, and one parent per youth, were interviewed at twelve months. Data collection and analysis used a phenomenological research framework and coded the data according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (the ICF). This was done in order to capture all relevant impacts of the intervention.",
        "Physical activity was associated with benefits in all components of the ICF. Changes in personal factors such as improved attitude, confidence, and insight into activity were emphasized. Parents also experienced personal benefits as a result of their child engaging in the program.",
        "Physical activity had positive effects in many aspects of the lives of the participants and their parents. The ICF was a relatively useful and effective system for coding qualitative research. These findings should assist in development of future exercise programs."
