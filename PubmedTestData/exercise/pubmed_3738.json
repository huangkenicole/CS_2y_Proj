      "AbstractText": [
        "Inadequate levels of physical activity among older people lead to a gradual decline in self-reliance and consequent dependence on other people. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of Nordic walking training with poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber on the functional fitness of older women. Forty-two women (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 64.7 \u00b1 3.15 years) were randomly assigned into the experimental group-training with poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber, EG (<i>n</i> = 21) and the control active group-training with classic poles, CG (<i>n</i> = 21). Functional fitness was measured with the Senior Fitness Test before and after an intervention lasting for 8 weeks (2 training sessions \u00d7 75 minutes per week). Two-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant interaction effects for aerobic endurance (<i>F</i> = 14.47, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and upper body strength (<i>F</i> = 5.98, <i>p</i> < 0.05), indicating greater improvement in the experimental group. Nordic walking training both with classic poles and with poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber is beneficial for older people and improves functional fitness over a short time period. However, the poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber provide additional resistance effort during marching, which causes increased muscle activation and results in improved muscle strength and aerobic endurance. Based on these results, it can be concluded that this kind of training could be applied in the complex health programs of seniors."
