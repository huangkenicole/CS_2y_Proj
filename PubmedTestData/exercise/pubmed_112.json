        "Exercise program has been recommended for the treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients. However, whether exercise promotes reduction in arterial stiffness in these patients, who exhibit high arterial stiffness, is poor known.",
        "To analyze the effects of a single session of resistance, walking, and combined exercises on arterial stiffness in symptomatic PAD patients and to describe individual responses and identify clinical predictors of arterial stiffness responses after exercises.",
        "Twelve patients with symptomatic PAD underwent four experimental sessions in random order: walking exercise (W - 10 bouts of 2-min walking at the speed corresponding to the onset of claudication pain with 2-min interval among sets), resistance exercise (R - 2 sets of 10 reps in eight resistance exercises), combined exercise (CO - 1 set of 10 reps in eight resistance exercises\u202f+\u202f5 bouts of 2-min walking with 2-min interval between) and control session (C - resting in exercise room). Ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) was obtained during ambulatory period after each session. Body mass index, ankle brachial index, sex and age also were evaluated.",
        "AASI was lower in R compared to other sessions (R - 0.52 \u00b1 0.05; W - 0.59 \u00b1 0.05; CO - 0.64 \u00b1 0.05; C - 0.60 \u00b1 0.05, P < 0.001), with 75% of patients presenting lower AASI after R session. No difference was found between W, CO and C sessions (P> 0.05). Ankle brachial index was negatively correlated with R and W sessions net effect (r\u202f=\u202f-0.618 and -0.750, respectively; P< 0.05 for both), no correlation was found with CO.",
        "A single bout of resistance exercise acutely reduces arterial stiffness in symptomatic PAD, while walking and combined exercise did not alter this variable. This response is more likely to occur in individuals with less severe disease."
