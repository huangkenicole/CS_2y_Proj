        "BACKGROUND Ankle sprain reduces capacity for neurosensory information processing, and these patients commonly progress to chronic ankle instability (CAI). To address this problem, the short-foot exercise (SFE) may be used. However, there has been no previous research on the neurosensory impact of SFE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess improvement of quantitative neurosensory indicators after SFE and to determine the effect of proprioceptive sensory exercise (PSE) in patients with CAI. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study included 30 adults (age range: 19-29 years; 50% female). Selection criteria for CAI (Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool \u00a324) were implemented, and participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: SFE (n1=15) and PSE (n2=15). Exercises were conducted 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Measurements of quantitative somatosensory of joint position sense and vibration sensory thresholds, dynamic balance, and ankle instability assessment were evaluated before and after completion of each intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated- measures analysis of variance. RESULTS In a time-by-group comparison, the SFE group showed a more significant improvement with regards to eversion joint position sense (F1,28=4.543, p<0.05). For vibration sensory threshold, the SFE group showed a more significant improvement (F1,28=8.280, p<0.01). Balance index according to anterio-posterior, mediolateral, and overall index the SFE group a more significant improvement (F1,28=6.666, 4.585, 5.207, p<0.05). And ankle instability SFE group showed a more significant improvement (F1,28=6.890, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS SFE is more effective than PSE for treating ankle sprain patients. There is a need to develop and promote an effective and controlled exercise program to facilitate the return of ankle sprain patients to normal daily life."
