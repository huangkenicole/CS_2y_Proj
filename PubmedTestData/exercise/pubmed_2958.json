      "AbstractText": [
        "Patients discharged from hospitals after an inpatient course of medical treatment for any ailment or traumatic injury that results in disabling conditions and are rendered mobility impaired require ongoing systematic sports and exercise programs to maintain healthy lifestyles. Under such circumstances, a rehabilitation exercise and sports center, accessible throughout local communities, is critical for promoting beneficial living and community participation for these individuals with disabilities. An innovative data-driven system equipped with state-of-the-art smart and digital equipment, set up in architecturally barrier-free infrastructures, is essential for these individuals to promote health maintenance and overcome secondary medical complications following an acute inpatient hospitalization or suboptimal rehabilitation. A federally funded collaborative research and development (R&D) program proposes to build a multi-ministerial data-driven system of exercise programs using a smart digital living lab as a platform to provide pilot services in physical education and counseling with exercise and sports programs for this patient population. We describe the social and critical aspects of rehabilitating such a population of patients by presenting a full study protocol. A modified sub-dataset of the previously generated 280-item full dataset is applied using a data-collecting system-\"The Elephant\"-as an example of how data acquisition will be achieved to assess the effects of lifestyle rehabilitative exercise programs for people with disabilities."
