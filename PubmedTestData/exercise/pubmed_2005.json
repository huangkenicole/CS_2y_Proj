        "To investigate the efficacy of an eight-week lumbopelvic stabilization program (CO-CUIDATE) for colon cancer survivors.",
        "A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled clinical trial.",
        "A blinded, trained researcher performed the end point assessments for pain (Pressure Pain Threshold and Brief Pain Inventory) and muscle architecture (ultrasound imaging measurements).",
        "Forty-six colon cancer survivors who were assigned to the CO-CUIDATE group or usual care group.",
        "The CO-CUIDATE program was conducted for eight weeks. A trained researcher who was blinded to patient group performed the assessments. The tests were carried out with multiple observations. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed.",
        "The program had an adherence rate of 88.36% and two dropouts (10.5%). The participants reported some minor side effects during the first exercise sessions. The analysis revealed significant differences in the group x time interactions for the lumbar side (dominant: F\u2009=\u20093.1, P \u2009<\u20090.001; nondominant: F\u2009=\u20093.0, P \u2009=\u20090.01) and the infra-umbilical dominant side (F\u2009=\u20091.2, P \u2009=\u20090.04) after the program and at the six-month follow-up and for the internal oblique thickness (F\u2009=\u20095.1, P \u2009=\u20090.030) after the program. The experimental group experienced a greater improvement in all values after the program compared with the control group. There were no significant changes in the other pressure pain threshold points, pain severity, interference of pain, or the remaining ultrasound imaging measurements.",
        "The CO-CUIDATE program is effective for improving the musculoskeletal conditions related to the lumbopelvic area in colon cancer survivors, specifically in relation to pain and the internal oblique thickness."
