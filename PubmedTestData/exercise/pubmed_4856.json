        "To compare the effects of eccentric muscle energy technique versus static stretching exercises combined with cervical segmental mobilisation in the management of upper cross syndrome in patients having neck pain.",
        "The randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Khan Kinetic Treatment Canada Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from August 2017 to January 2018, and comprised patients of upper cross syndrome who were randomized into two equal groups using lottery method. Patients in Group-A were treated with eccentric muscle energy technique with cervical segmental mobilisation, while those in Group-B received static stretching exercises with cervical segmental mobilisation. Two sessions per week for 3 weeks were given to each patient who were analysed by measuring tragus-to-wall distance, visual analogue scale and neck disability index. Cervical passive range of motion was measured using inclinometer. Data was recorded at baseline and after 3 weeks of treatment. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.",
        "Of the 40 subjects, 20(50%) each were in the two groups. In Group-A mean age was 42.75\u00b111.13 years. In Group-B, it was 40.50\u00b19.14 years. Eccentric muscle energy technique and static stretching technique both showed significant results (p<0.05) for within group analysis, but comparison across groups showed non-significant results (p>0.05 each) on all parameters.",
        "Both the techniques used were found to be equally effective in decreasing pain, improving cervical range of motion and reducing neck disability."
