        "This study aimed to explore whether the relationship between perceptual (rating of perceived exertion; RPE) and mechanical (maximal number of repetitions completed [MNR], fastest set velocity, and mean velocity decline) variables is affected by the length of inter-set rest periods during resistance training sets not leading to failure. Twenty-three physically active individuals (15 men and eight women) randomly completed 12 testing sessions resulting from the combination of two exercises (bench press and bench pull), three inter-set rest protocols (1, 3, and 5 min), and two minimal velocity thresholds (farther from muscular failure [MVT<sub>0.45</sub> for bench press and MVT<sub>0.65</sub> for bench pull] and closer to muscular failure [MVT<sub>0.35</sub> for bench press and MVT<sub>0.55</sub> for bench pull]). The duration of inter-set rest periods did not have a significant impact on RPE values (<i>p</i> ranged from 0.061 to 0.951). Higher proximities to failure, indicated by lower MVTs, were associated with increased RPE values (<i>p</i> < 0.05 in 19 out of 24 comparisons). Moreover, as the number of sets increased, an upward trend in RPE values was observed (<i>p</i> < 0.05 in seven out of 12 comparisons). Finally, while acknowledging some inconsistencies, it was generally observed that higher magnitudes of the mechanical variables, especially MNR (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> < -0.55 in three out of four comparisons), were associated with lower RPE values. These results, which were comparable for the bench press and bench pull exercises, suggest that post-set RPE values are affected by the fatigue experienced at both the beginning and end of the set."
