      "AbstractText": [
        "Recumbent stationary cycling is a potential exercise modality for individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) that lack the postural control needed for upright exercises. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of lower extremity muscles can help such individuals reach the cycling intensities that are required for aerobic benefits. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of cycling with and without FES assistance to that of a no-intervention control group on the cardiorespiratory fitness of children with CP. Thirty-nine participants were randomized to a FES group that underwent an 8-week FES-assisted cycling program, the volitional group (VOL), who cycled without FES, or a no-intervention control group (CON) (15 FES, 11 VOL, 13 CON). Cadence, peak VO<sub>2</sub>, and net rise in heart rate were assessed at baseline, end of training, and washout (8-weeks after cessation of training). Latent growth curve modeling was used for analysis. The FES group showed significantly higher cycling cadences than the VOL and CON groups at POST and WO. There were no differences in improvements in the peak VO<sub>2</sub> and peak net HR between groups. FES-assisted cycling may help children with CP attain higher cycling cadences and to retain these gains after training cessation. Higher training intensities may be necessary to obtain improvements in peak VO<sub>2</sub> and heart rate."
