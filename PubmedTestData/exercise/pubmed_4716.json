        "Endurance exercise training and weight loss (WL) have been associated with changes in fat oxidation. However, there is limited evidence investigating the impact of sprint interval training (SIT)-induced WL on fat oxidation in adults. To investigate the impact of SIT with or without WL on fat oxidation, 34 adults aged 19-60\u2009years (males, n\u2009=\u200915) took part in 4-week SIT. SIT consisted of 30-s Wingates starting with two intervals and working up to four interspersed with 4\u2009min of active recovery. Fat oxidation was estimated via indirect calorimetry using a metabolic cart during submaximal cycling. Following the intervention, participants were classified into a WL group (weight change >0\u2009kg) or a non-WL group (weight change \u22640\u2009kg). No difference in resting fat oxidation (p\u2009=\u20090.642) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (p\u2009=\u20090.646) were observed between the groups. There was a significant interaction for the WL group with increased submaximal fat oxidation usage (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and decreased submaximal RER over the duration of the study (p\u2009=\u20090.017). When adjusted for baseline weight and sex, submaximal fat oxidation usage remained significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05), while RER did not (p\u2009=\u20090.081). The WL group had higher work volume, relative peak power, and mean power than the non-WL group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Short-term SIT elicited significant improvements in submaximal RER and fat oxidation (FOx) in adults that lost weight, which may be explained by an increase in work volume throughout SIT training."
