        "To examine the feasibility and efficacy of home-based aerobic and resistance exercise interventions for geriatric individuals with cognitive impairment.",
        "Fourteen participants with cognitive impairment were allocated to either the aerobic group (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or the resistance group (n\u00a0=\u00a06), after which they implemented a two-month home-based training program. Feasibility and efficacy outcomes were evaluated. A semi-structured interview was performed after the intervention.",
        "All fourteen participants completed the two-month training program. The adherence rate was 0.94 for the aerobic group and 0.96 for the resistance group. No adverse events occurred. The results revealed a trend of group\u00d7time interaction effect on delayed recall. Significant group\u00d7time interaction effects were revealed on simple physical performance and body composition. Semi-structured interviews identified four motivators for participating in this program, four facilitators for and three barriers to keeping exercising, and some perceived benefits.",
