        "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which is the most common type of scoliosis, is a progressive disease that occurs in children aged 10-16 years. Abnormal curvature in AIS provokes spinal asymmetry of the upper body alignment and might deteriorate postural balancing and control ability.",
        "To evaluate the effect of exercise interventions on balance and postural stability in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.",
        "Embase, Scopus, Pubmed (Medline) and Web of Science databases were searched using the terms idiopathic scoliosis, physiotherapy, and balance. The articles selected were published in English in peer-reviewed journals from 2012 to July 2022.",
        "Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. The PEDro scale values ranged from 2 to 6 (mean, 3.6), indicating a low level of scientific rigor. In the sample studies, spinal stabilization exercises were most often trialed (n= 3), followed by Schroth's exercise (n= 2), stretching and self-elongation exercise (n= 2), the exercise protocol of Blount and Moe, physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercise, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise (all n= 1).",
        "Physical therapists will be able to apply hippotherapy, Schroth exercise, physiotherapy scoliosis-specific exercise, trunk stabilization, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercise, spinal stabilization exercise, core stabilization exercise, and body awareness therapy to manage balance impairments in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and further studies are needed to provide stronger evidence."
