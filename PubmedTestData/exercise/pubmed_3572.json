        "Bilateral foot injuries are not uncommon. Operative treatment usually requires partial weight bearing over several weeks. This is a challenge for physiotherapy especially for ambulation training. We describe a new rehabilitation aid allowing for bilateral limited weight bearing during ambulation.",
        "Ambulation training was initiated in the early postoperative period using the Regensburg ambulation aid. A lift system allows for exact limitation of weight bearing on both sides controlled by balances integrated into the floor. Using a rail system a 15 m free walking distance is available. This study included 10 patients with bilateral foot fractures. The functional outcome was assessed using the AOFAS score and quality of life with the SF-36 score. Plain X-rays were used to evaluate loss of correction. The control group consisted of 20 patients where ambulation training was discontinued for at least 6 weeks postoperatively.",
        "The system is very safe, during the entire period no complication was recorded. Acceptance among the patients was extremely high. Worries about unwanted weight bearing could be reduced. Patients mobilized with early ambulation training showed a better compensation of gait if compared to the control group. Secondary problems in the knee, hip or spine, as well as muscular deficiencies had a significantly lower incidence. No loss of correction could be seen in either of the two groups.",
        "The presented ambulation aid is a significant contribution to the physiotherapy of bilateral foot injuries."
