        "The objective of exercise in the treatment of osteoporosis is to improve axial stability through improvement of muscle strength. Therefore, a back extension exercise program specific to one's musculoskeletal competence and pain can be performed in a sitting position and later advanced to the prone position. When fragility is resolved, back extension is performed against resistance applied to the upper back. To decrease pain and immobility in acute vertebral fracture, use of spinal orthoses become inevitable. Therapeutic exercise should address osteoporosis-related deformities of axial posture, which can increase risk of fall and fracture. Strengthening of the major appendicular muscles decreases fragility. The effect of strengthening exercise is augmented by proper intake of cholecalciferol and calcium. Thus, the role of a therapeutic exercise program is to increase muscle strength safely, decrease immobility-related complications, and prevent fall and fracture. As with pharmacotherapy, therapeutic exercises are individualized."
