        "Hemodialysis (HD) patients often experience cognitive deficits and reduced mobility. While studies have shown promising results of physical and/or cognitive training in older adults, their effects in HD patients remain understudied.",
        "This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 12-week intradialytic training program combining cognitive training with physical exercise on attention domains and spontaneous gait speed (SGS) in HD patients.",
        "Forty-four HD patients were randomly assigned to either intradialytic cognitive and physical exercise training (EXP group; n\u2009=\u200922) or a standard care control group (CON group; n\u2009=\u200922). The EXP group performed intradialytic cycling and tablet-based cognitive training three days per week for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome of the study was performance on the computerized test battery 'Test of Attentional Performance.' Secondary study outcome was patient mobility assessed by the four-meter SGS. Outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention.",
        "Significant group x time interaction was observed in alertness (F(1,41)\u2009=\u20096.15, p\u2009=\u20090.017) and SGS (F(1,41)\u2009=\u200918.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001) in favor of the EXP group. Within-group analysis revealed a significant pre-post decline in the CON group in alertness test (-26.7\u00a0s; p\u2009=\u20090.04) and an improvement of SGS in EXP group (+\u20090.07\u00a0s; p\u2009<\u20090.001).",
        "This original study demonstrated that a combined physical and cognitive intradialytic training intervention led to improvements in SGS and preservation in alertness compared to a deterioration in the CON group.",
        "Findings suggest that the intervention may serve as an effective tool to prevent the physical and cognitive decline in this patient population."
