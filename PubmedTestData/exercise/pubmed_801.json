        "Newer techniques of exercise which rely on a static or isometric muscle contraction of six seconds' duration once daily offer great possibilities in the treatment of patients incapacitated by low cardiac reserve, joints that are painful on movement or debility too severe to permit a conventional exercise program for general conditioning. Increments of strength of up to two per cent per day can be thus achieved in normal muscles. Muscles deconditioned by immobilization respond at a faster rate. However, no significant muscle hypertrophy can be achieved by this technique. This form of exercise can also be used by persons who are \"too busy to exercise\" but who may be willing to give two minutes a day to an exercise program designed to increase and maintain muscle tone and strength.A considerable number of medical conditions could be treated more effectively and with less resultant disability if therapeutic exercises-passive, active and progressive-were accurately prescribed and supervised by a physician as part of the treatment program. Among the many conditions to be considered are poliomyelitis, peripheral nerve injuries, the neuritides, postural defects and cardiac diseases."
