        "The purpose of this review is to evaluate recent trials and studies of different types of physical activity programs for individuals with chronic arthritis and to discuss recommendations and findings from systematic reviews of physical activity interventions.",
        "Recent randomized control trials of different multicomponent land-based, aquatic, Tai Chi, and strength training programs report moderate benefits after intervention and at 6 and 12 months for individuals with various types of chronic arthritis. Reported benefits include increasing physical activity, strength, and balance, improving functional status, reducing symptoms, and enhancing self-efficacy. Recent systematic reviews recommend evidence-based, land-based, aquatic, Tai Chi, and strength training programs for individuals with arthritis.",
        "There is a preponderance of strong scientific evidence that both aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises, alone or in combination, are safe and moderately effective for individuals with chronic arthritis."
