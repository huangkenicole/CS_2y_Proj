        "Background Previous studies investigating the beneficial effects of exercise in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are relatively insufficient compared to studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), due to the fear of hypoglycemia. Recently, several researchers have reported that combined aerobic and resistance exercise prevents hypoglycemia during and after exercise. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on the psychological status of patients with various diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined aerobic and resistance exercise in adolescents with T1DM. Methods Thirty-five type 1 diabetic patients were enrolled, and subjects were divided into either an exercise group or a control group. Thirty patients (20 patients in the exercise group, 10 patients in the control group) completed the study. The exercise program was performed for 1 h at a time, once a week, for 12 weeks. Study parameters were evaluated at baseline and 3 months after baseline evaluation. Results Combined aerobic and resistance exercise better controlled the body mass index (BMI), and also improved maximum muscular strength and maximum exercise intensity. On psychological tests, subjects' attention and quality of life showed improving tendency, while their stress and behavioral problems diminished. The number of exercise events increased in the training group, while the daily total insulin dose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level showed no significant changes. Conclusions A 12-week structured exercise program consisting of aerobic and resistance exercises improves cardiovascular, neurocognitive and psychobehavioral functions, and positively helps lifestyle modification in patients with T1DM."
