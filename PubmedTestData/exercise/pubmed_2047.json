        "The purpose of this study was to identify referral source and patient-reported factors that promoted follow-through and participation in exercise oncology rehabilitation programs. A three question open-ended survey was administered to patients enrolled in trainer-supervised, hospital-based (n\u2009=\u2009101), or university-based (n\u2009=\u200917) cancer rehabilitation program that provided 12\u00a0weeks of individualized one on one aerobic and resistance training 1-3\u00a0days per week. Significant themes for each question were as follows: Question #1. Who referred you to the program/facility? Oncology team (\u03a7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u2009145.814 P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001); Question #2. What convinced you to follow through with the referral? Health, fatigue, and need for supervision (\u03a7<sup>2</sup> = 74.814 P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001); and Question #3. What motivates you to continue in the program? Personal results, getting healthy, and the trainer (\u03a7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u2009108.729 P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). In this study, oncology team referral confirms previous work. Patient follow-through and continuation appear largely self-motivated as patients' health and the attainment of health through personal results are primary motivators for continuation in the program. Question #3 responses note the importance of the trainer in maintaining continuation in an exercise oncology rehabilitation program."
