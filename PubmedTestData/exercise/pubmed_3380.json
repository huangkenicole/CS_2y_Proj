        "<b><i>Background:</i></b> The aim of this study was to compare the effects of complex decongestive therapy (CDT) accompanied by resistance exercises on extremity circumference, lymphedema volume, grip strength, functional status, and quality of life in the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) in patients with and without pain. <b><i>Methods and Results:</i></b> Fifty patients with unilateral BCRL were divided into groups: with pain (Group 1, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200925) and without pain (Group 2, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200925). Thirty minutes of manual lymphatic drainage and multilayered short-stretch bandaging were applied to all patients five times a week for 4 weeks. In addition, all patients were informed about skin care and given a supervised resistance exercise program throughout the treatment. During the 1-month follow-up period, patients were asked to use low-tension elastic garments and to continue their home exercise program. Differences in upper extremity circumference and volume; grip strength; Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scores were evaluated at baseline, after treatment (week 4), and at 1-month follow-up. Moreover, the pain intensity of patients in Group 1 was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). Patients in both Group 1 and Group 2 showed a statistical improvement in all outcome measures after treatment and at follow-up (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05); however, no significant difference was observed between the groups (<i>p</i>\u2009>\u20090.05). In Group 1, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the VAS score both at the end of treatment (-1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9) and at 1-month follow-up (-3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2) (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Combined CDT and resistance exercises appear to be effective in BCRL patients both with and without pain."
