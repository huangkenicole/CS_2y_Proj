        "In rehabilitation, exergames and serious games are widely usedin order to motivate patients in the therapeutic procedure. Patients are asked to modify their incorrect motor patterns or reinforce the proper ones through activity rather than exercise. Interactive applications as such, can have a huge impact on a patient's motivation making repetitive physical exercises into pleasant experiences, thus maximizing the gains of therapy. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a serious game platform based on virtual 3D game environment and leap motion controller for interaction. For each session, achieved goals and response to stimuli is recorded and analyzed. Preliminary analysis results from evaluating the game with healthy subjects are encouraging."
