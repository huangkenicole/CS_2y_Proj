      "AbstractText": [
        "Physical therapy is recommended for the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with the focus of promoting physical activity and prescribing exercise within four domains, outlined recently by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR): aerobic, resistance, flexibility and neuro-motor exercise. There is an increasing evidence base to support physical therapy interventions in axSpA.",
        "We present evidence supporting the use of exercise as treatment for patients with axSpA, recent updates among different exercise modalities, and make clear its critical place in the management of this condition. Recent large, multicentre data have shown that high-intensity exercise can improve disease activity and also positively impact cardiovascular risk factors in these patients. Although international treatment guidelines advocate the inclusion of physical activity and exercise for the optimal management of axSpA, specific guidance about the amount of exercise required to produce a beneficial effect is lacking.",
        "Exercise must be used in the management of axSpA, and whilst hydrotherapy and flexibility exercises are traditionally the main focus, other applications, such as strength training, may be underutilized domains. Further studies are needed to determine the dose-response relationship between exercise and axSpA patient subsets."
