        "For individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), memory loss may prevent successful engagement in exercise, a key factor in preventing additional disability. The Resources and Activities for Life Long Independence (RALLI) program uses behavioral principles to make exercise more accessible for these individuals. Exercises are broken into small steps, sequenced, and linked with cues to help participants remember them. Memory aids, easy-to-follow instructions, and tracking forms to facilitate adherence and proper technique are provided to enhance exercise training and compensate for memory loss.",
        "Thirty-seven individuals (M age = 81.9, SD = 5.8, range 70%-96; 78% women) participated in RALLI pilot groups held in retirement residences. Attendance was excellent, with participants attending 90% of classes.",
        "At post-test (12 weeks), 84% of participants had exercised at least once during the prior week, compared with 62% who had exercised at least once during the week prior to baseline (p < .001), mean exercise time increased by 156 min per week (p < .0001), and SF-36 physical components scale significantly improved (p < .002). After 6 months, 76% of participants continued exercising (p < .003) and mean exercise time remained significantly improved (p < .0001).",
        "Persons with MCI can significantly benefit from an exercise program specifically designed to address their cognitive needs. Participants' ratings indicate improvement in perceived physical health and emotional well-being as a result of the intervention. Thus, RALLI is a promising intervention to promote exercise in individuals with MCI."
