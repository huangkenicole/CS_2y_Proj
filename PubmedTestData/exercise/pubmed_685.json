        "To analyze intervention goals, protocols, and outcome measures used for oral and pharyngeal motor exercises in post-stroke recovery.",
        "MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched in September 2022.",
        "Studies were included if they (1) recruited post-stroke adult patients, (2) administered exercises for the oral and/ or pharyngeal muscles, and (3) reported results at baseline and post-exercise. The extracted data included intervention goals, protocols, and outcomes. All outcomes were classified according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).",
        "A total of 26 studies were identified. Their intervention goals aimed to rehabilitate a broad spectrum of muscle groups within the oral cavity and pharynx and to improve the functions of swallowing, speech, facial expressions, or sleep breathing. Protocol duration ranged from 1 to 13 weeks, with various exercise repetitions (times per day) and frequency (days per week). Half of the studies reported using feedback to support the training, and these studies varied in the feedback strategy and technology tool. A total of 37 unique outcome measures were identified. Most measures represented the body functions and body structure component of the ICF, and several of these measures showed large treatment effects.",
        "This review demonstrated inconsistency across published studies in intervention goals and exercise protocols. It has also identified current limitations and provided recommendations for the selection of outcome measures while advancing a multidisciplinary view of oral and pharyngeal exercises in post-stroke recovery across relevant functions."
