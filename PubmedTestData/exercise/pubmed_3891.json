        "Boxing training has become a popular form of exercise for people with Parkinson disease (PD). There is a dearth of high-quality feasibility, safety, and efficacy data on boxing training for PD. Feasibility of Instituting Graduated High-intensity Training (FIGHT-PD) aimed to examine these features in a periodized boxing training program featuring high-intensity physical and cognitive demands.",
        "To conduct a feasibility study, aiming to address deficiencies in the current knowledge base and to provide data for future studies.",
        "Single-arm, open-label feasibility.",
        "University department and medical research institute.",
        "Ten people with early stage PD without contraindications to intense exercise, identified from a database of participants interested in boxing training.",
        "A 15-week exercise program with three 1-hour sessions per week, with each session including warmup and then rounds of noncontact boxing using a training device. Three distinct blocks of 5\u2009weeks including active rest. Boxers Development: focus on training technique Boxers Cardio: increasing intensity, including high-intensity interval training Boxers Brain: focus on cognitively challenging dual task training MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Process, resource, and management measures including recruitment and retention rates, timelines and costs, and compliance with prescribed exercise targets. Clinical outcomes were safety (adverse events), training intensity (using heart rate and perceived exertion monitoring), tolerability (pain, fatigue, and sleep scores), and pre- and postprogram Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III).",
        "Among 10 participants from a pool of 82 (recruitment rate\u2009=\u200912%), there were no withdrawals; 348/360 workouts were completed (adherence\u2009=\u200997.7%); 4/348 (1.1%) workouts were missed due to minor injury. Nine of 10 participants showed improvement in UPDRS motor score.",
        "FIGHT-PD provides a depth of feasibility and safety data, methodological detail, and preliminary results that is not described elsewhere and could provide a useful basis for future studies of boxing training for PD."
