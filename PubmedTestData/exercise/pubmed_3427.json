        "The study compared the effects of isometric quadriceps exercise and proprioceptive exercise on pain, joint stiffness and physical difficulties of patients with knee osteoarthritis.",
        "Forty-five patients with history of knee osteoarthritis were randomly allocated into two groups; A with 23 subjects and B with 22 subjects.",
        "All subjects received infrared radiation for 20 minutes and kneading massage with methyl salicylate ointment. Group A underwent proprioceptive exercises while Group B had isometric quadriceps exercise. Each exercise session lasted for 10 minutes according to standard protocol, twice in a week for six weeks. Pre-treatment, 3rd week and 6th week pain intensity, joint stiffness and physical difficulties were assessed using Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire. Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 17 was used to analyse the data while descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarise the result.",
        "Proprioceptive exercises reduced pain intensity significantly (F = 4.76; p = 0.00) at 6th week with effect size of 2.79, and physical difficulty (F = 3.69; p < 0.04) with effect size of 7.53 better than isometric exercises. There was a significant reduction in the pain intensity (F = 12.08; p < 0.001), and physical difficulties (F = 3.69, p = 0.04) in pre-treatment, 3rd week and 6th week in both Group A and B.",
        "Both exercises are effective but proprioceptive exercises may be more effective in the management of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) than isometric exercises."
