        "Treating first episode psychosis represents a critical time to improve the trajectory of people's physical health, mental health, functioning, and quality of life. Individuals should be offered a variety of evidence-based interventions to promote physical activity and social connectedness. This review aimed to establish the effectiveness of group-based exercise interventions for improving outcomes in people with first episode psychosis.",
        "We undertook a systematic review of the following databases; Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and CINAHL, to identify studies in first episode psychosis populations that implemented a group-based exercise intervention and examined outcomes in physical health, mental health or functioning and quality of life.",
        "From 1431 studies screened, five met our inclusion criteria. Whilst group-based exercise interventions did not have a significant impact on physical health, there was a significant effect on psychiatric symptomatology, quality of life and functioning (including cognition). The overall risk of bias was high.",
        "Group-based exercise interventions may be feasible and acceptable in first episode psychosis populations. However, more, high quality research is required to understand the best mode of delivery of exercise interventions to maximise patient outcomes and optimise patient contact with services using an engaging and cost-effective approach."
