        "In order to scientifically explore the effective path of strength quality training of basketball players and improve the effect of strength quality training of basketball players, this paper takes young basketball players as the research object and comprehensively observes the changes and improvement of strength quality by building a strength training monitoring system for basketball players. On this basis, it is proposed to integrate blood flow restriction and basketball players' special strength training. Through the comparison with the traditional resistance strength training method, it is found that after 8 weeks of experimental comparison, the athletes' strength quality test indicators show that the average 3RM of the experimental group 1 bench press is 65.2\u2009kg, the experimental group 2 is 65.7\u2009kg, and the experimental group 3 is 72.2\u2009kg. The average performance of the traditional control group was 55.4\u2009kg. Compared with the traditional group, the average performance of the three experimental groups in bench press was significantly improved, which also verified the feasibility of this method in strength quality training."
