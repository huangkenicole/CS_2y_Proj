      "AbstractText": [
        "Fever in children is one of the most common symptoms of pediatric diseases and the most common complaint in pediatric clinics, especially in the emergency department. Diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis are leading causes of death in children, and the early manifestations of these diseases are accompanied by fever symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and real-time monitoring of the status of febrile children, rapid and effective identification of the cause, and treatment can have a positive impact on relieving their symptoms and improving their quality of life. In recent years, wearable diagnostic sensors have attracted special attention for their high flexibility, real-time monitoring, and sensitivity. Temperature sensors and heart rate sensors have provided new advances in detecting children's body temperature and heart rate. Furthermore, some novel formulations have also received wide attention for addressing bottlenecks in medication administration for febrile children, such as difficulty in swallowing and inaccurate dosing. In this context, the present review provides recent advances of novel wearable medical sensor devices for diagnosing fever. Moreover, the application progress of innovative dosage forms of classical antipyretic drugs for children is presented. Finally, challenges and prospects of wearable sensor-based diagnostics and novel agent-based treatment of fever in children are discussed in brief."
