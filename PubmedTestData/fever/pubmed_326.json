        "We measured body temperature in Pekin ducks for 22 h after intravenous injection of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram negative bacteria at doses of 0, 1, 10, and 100 micrograms.kg body mass (-1). The ducks developed monophasic fevers showing increases in peak temperature reached and duration of fever with increases in dose of LPS. Body temperatures of unrestrained telemetered ducks without access to food and water were similar to those of saline-injected controls in the fever experiments, but were lower in the morning than when the same birds had access to food and water. This nocturnal hypothermia may have resulted from energy restriction imposed by lack of food and water. The dose of LPS required to elicit a fever of over 18 h duration (100 micrograms.kg-1) will elicit a biphasic fever of 5 h duration in rats. Pekin ducks did not exhibit biphasic fever even at the highest LPS dose administered, indicating that while fever is superficially similar in the two homeothermic classes, there may be differences in details of the mechanism. The similarities of the dose/response characteristics to that of mammals lends support to the theory that fever in vertebrates has a common phyletic origin."
