        "Platelet concentrates (PC) are used in thrombocytopenia for curative or preventive treatment for hemorrhagic risk. Since five years, additive solutions have been added in PCs for several reasons; one of them is to present an interest in the intolerance in plasma reactions. The literature data have shown that these solutions entail fewer allergic reactions than PCs kept in plasma. This study was reviewed on three years of transfusion in France. The main objective of this study was to see if there was a difference in frequency when these PCs were in solution or not. All adverse reactions in recipients (ARR) occurring among PCs recipients (with and without additive solution) were analysed. The categories of ARR specifically studied were: allergies, febril non haemolytic reactions (FNHR) and the category \"unknown\". This study shows that there is significantly lower incidence of allergies by introducing solution. For all ARRs, there is also a decrease in their frequency when PCs are in additive solution, it is significant except for the apheresis platelet concentrates. For categories FNHR and \"unknown\", the results are opposed and/or not significant. This study confirms that introduction of additive solutions in PCs is able to reduce some allergic transfusion reactions."
