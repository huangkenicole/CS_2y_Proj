        "Fever is a brain-mediated increase in body temperature mainly during inflammatory or infectious challenges. Although there is considerable data regarding the inflammation pathways involved in fever, metabolic alterations necessary to orchestrate the complex inflammatory response are not totally understood. We performed proteomic analysis of rat hypothalamus using label-free LC-MS/MS in a model of fever induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). In total, 7021 proteins were identified. As far as we know, this is the largest rat hypothalamus proteome dataset available to date. Pathway analysis showed proteins from both stimuli associated with inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Concerning metabolic pathways, rats exposed to LPS or PGE<sub>2</sub> presented lower relative abundance of proteins involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mitochondrial function may also be altered by both stimuli because significant downregulation of several proteins was found, mainly in complexes I and IV. LPS was able to induce downregulation of important proteins in the enzymatic antioxidant system, thereby contributing to oxidative stress. The results offered comprehensive information about fever responses and helped to reveal new insights into proteins potentially involved in inflammatory signaling and metabolic changes in the hypothalamus during systemic LPS and central PGE<sub>2</sub> administration.",
        "The evolutionary persistence of fever, despite the elevated cost for maintenance of this response, suggests that elevation in core temperature may represent an interesting strategy for survival. Fever response is achieved through the integrated behavioral, physiological, immunological and biochemical processes that determine the balance between heat generation and elimination. The development of such complex response arouses interest in studying how the cell metabolism responds or even contributes to promote fever. Our results offered comprehensive information about fever responses, including metabolic and inflammatory pathways, providing new insights into candidate proteins potentially involved in inflammatory signaling and metabolic changes in the hypothalamus during fever induced by systemic LPS and central PGE<sub>2</sub> perturbation."
