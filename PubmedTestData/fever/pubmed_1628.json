        "Fever with neutropenia is a common clinical problem in patients receiving cancer treatment. Prevention and optimum management of infectious complications is critical to the overall success of cancer therapy. This article provides an overview of the current status of this evolving subject. While the basic principles of rapid institution of broad spectrum antibiotics, early intervention with empiric antifungal therapy and continuation of antimicrobials during period of risk are unlikely to change, there is increasing interest in titrating this aggressive approach based on the projected risk of the development of a serious invasive infection. Oral antibiotic therapy and outpatient management are currently being studied in pediatric oncology patients, but even when successful these alternatives to the traditional \"in hospital, parenteral antibiotic therapy\" approach are unlikely to be applicable in all patient populations and clinical settings. While there is no replacement for clinical acumen and careful monitoring, judicious use of diagnostic resources such as blood cultures and imaging studies is a key component of optimum care. Selection of empiric antibiotics based on ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns is emphasized."
