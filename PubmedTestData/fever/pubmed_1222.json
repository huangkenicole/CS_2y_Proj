        "The management of febrile neutropenia (FN) in pediatrics is evolving. Our objective was to describe current practices for the care of patients with FN in pediatric oncology centers in Latin America and identify areas for practice improvement. We used an online survey to enroll eligible healthcare providers who treat children with cancer in Latin America. The survey addressed respondents' characteristics, the environment of care, and FN care practices, including risk assessment, criteria for hospitalization, initial management of FN, evaluation, antibiotic administration, and discharge. From 220 surveys sent, we received 109 responses and selected 108 from 19 countries for analysis. Most (94%) respondents were working in specialized oncology centers, oncology units within a pediatric or general care hospital. The cohort included oncologists (42%) and infectious diseases physicians (30%). Most (67%) respondents had available guidelines; they used a risk-stratification scoring system (73%) for severe infection; and their guidelines had locally adapted risk stratification (34%) or published risk stratification (51%). The respondents used diverse FN definitions and concepts, including fever definitions, temperature-obtaining methods, neutropenia values for assigning risk, empiric antimicrobials administration, and length of hospitalization. Overall, we detected common practices aligning with standard published recommendations, as well as care variability. These findings can guide further evaluations of care resources and practices to prioritize interventions, and professional networks can be used for FN discussions and consensus in Latin America."
