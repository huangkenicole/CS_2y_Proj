        "The action of solasodine, the steroid-structure alcaloid of Solanum laciniatum Ait., was studied on normal and pyretic body temperature of rats and mice. In rats a single dosage of 3 mg/kg depressed by an average of --1.5+/-0.3 degrees C the normal temperature for 24 h. With larger dosages or longer treatment the effect could not be intensified and tolerance was also not observed. In mice the temperature decrease was even more explicit, --2.0+/-0.2 degrees C lasting 48 h. The effect was reproducible by repeated treatment. In mice fever provoked by a suspension of killed bacteria, Pyrago\u00bf, or by 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) could be counteracted with 1 mmole/kg solasodine. Body temperature depressed with solasodine was not raised by Pyrago but became higher after administration of DNP, in part of the animals even comparable to normal initial averages. Following solasodine treatment the body temperature of normothermic rats and mice decreased to subnormal values. Pyrexia produced either with centrally acting Pyrago or with the peripherally acting DNP was depressed with small solasodine dosages. Previous administration of the alcaloid counteracted Pyrago effect but could not inhibit the development of DNP action. These data are pertaining to the possible central effect of solasodine."
