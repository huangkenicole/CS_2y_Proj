        "Postoperative fever in pediatric patients following reconstructive hip surgery is of unknown significance. This study identifies the prevalence of postoperative fever after corrective hip surgery, its relationship to infection, and whether preventative use of anti-pyretics affects patient outcomes.Overall, 222 patients who underwent a varus derotational osteotomy (VDRO) between 11/1/2004 to 8/1/2014 with minimum 6 months follow up were retrospectively identified. Variables included diagnosis, inpatient stay, daily maximum temperature, duration of fever, fever workup, and administration of scheduled anti-pyretics. Fever was defined as temperature \u226538\u00b0C.In total, 123/222 (55.4%) and 70/222 (31.5%) had postoperative fevers of \u226538\u00b0C and \u226538.5\u00b0C, respectively. Average inpatient stay was 2.7 days postoperatively. Temperature (mean\u200a=\u200a38.0\u00b0C) was greatest on postoperative day 1 (POD1), and 43.7% of patients had T \u226538\u00b0C on POD1. Anti-pyretics did not influence the duration of fever. Anti-pyretics on the day of surgery (POD0) did not influence the incidence of fever. Acetaminophen on POD0 significantly reduced likelihood of fever on POD1 (P\u200a=\u200a.02). Average length of fevers \u226538\u00b0C and 38.5\u00b0C were 8.4 and 4.2\u200ahours, respectively. 3/18 (16.7%) fever workups administered were positive. Postoperative fever did not predict infection. 9/222\u200a(4/1%) patients had postoperative infection - 5/123 (4.1%) with fever \u226538\u00b0C and 4/70 (5.7%) with fever \u226538.5\u00b0C. Rates of infection in patients with and without fevers were not significantly different (P\u200a=\u200a.97 for T \u226538\u00b0C and P\u200a=\u200a.38, for T \u226538.5\u00b0C).Though common, postoperative fever does not increase risk of infection. The low prevalence of positive cultures indicates routine fever workups can safely be avoided in most patients.Level of Evidence: III, retrospective comparative study."
