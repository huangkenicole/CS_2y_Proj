      "AbstractText": [
        "The patient overload in pediatric healthcare facilities is caused in part by parents bringing their children in for consultations for fever. We conducted a survey in the Lyon metropolitan area to improve our understanding of parents' attitudes towards their children's fever.",
        "To assess the frequency and characteristics of healthcare utilization and evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes before consulting.",
        "A random sample of families with at least one child under 6 years of age and living in the Lyon metropolitan area was surveyed by telephone, according to a closed questionnaire that was answered by the person usually responsible for the child's health.",
        "202 families were questioned: 58.9% defined fever as a temperature over 38 degrees C, and 82% used rectal thermometers to measure temperature. Among 144 parents of children with an episode of fever within the previous 12 months, 73% called a physician during the episode, 44% of them immediately. Working-class parents called more frequently (90%) than parents who were professionals or managers (74%). Most parents (94%) administered medication to the child several times before calling the physician. Paracetamol and ibuprofen were mentioned most often. 93% of fever episodes led to consultations.",
        "Our results show that 59% of the sample defined fever as a temperature equal to 38 degrees C and that fever episodes lead commonly and quickly to physician visits, but that parents do use physical methods and drugs to reduce fever before calling a physician."
