        "Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology, characterised by daily spiking high fevers accompanied by rash, arthritis, and systemic manifestations. There are no specific diagnostic tests for AOSD. To establish the diagnosis of AOSD one should require the fulfilment of proposed major and minor criteria as well as exclusion of other diseases. This report described a 35-year-old female who was presented with fever, pruritus, arthritis, sore throat, leukocytosis and hyperferritinemia. She was diagnosed to have AOSD based on Yamuguchi et al.5 criteria after the exclusion of other possible conditions."
