        "This study was a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. The aim was to explore parents' and primary caregivers' knowledge and conceptualizations of fever in children aged between 0 and 12\u2009years. A systematic literature search of the Medline, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, BIREME, CUIDEN, ProQuest, and PsycINFO databases was undertaken for qualitative studies published in English or Spanish up to December 2018. Ten studies were included in the thematic synthesis. Parents' perceptions of their children's fever were classified according to three criteria: fever as a pathology, care for the febrile child, and the search for understandable and reliable information on this topic. Fever was perceived as being harmful to children's health and as a pathology that requires health care. Further studies are necessary to gather key information for improving health action plans and satisfaction with the care received. This information might help us to understand the management of fever and the related fears experienced by caregivers. These perceptions can be influenced by parents' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs on fever and their previous experiences."
