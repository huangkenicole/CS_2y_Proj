        "We prospectively determined the impact of febrile infectious disease on long-term renal graft function compared with a matched control group.",
        "Included in our study were 39 patients who presented with episodes of febrile infection with body temperature greater than 38C on 2 consecutive occasions, necessitating hospitalization. In addition, 39 controls without febrile infection requiring hospitalization within 2 months were chosen from the complete data pool of all renal transplant recipients followed at our transplant clinic using the matched pair technique. Renal function was estimated by serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance.",
        "Of the 39 patients with infection 15 had urinary tract infection and 24 had other, mostly bacterial infection, including pneumonia/severe bronchitis in 12, oral/dental infection in 2, gastroenteritis in 2, shunt sepsis in 1, herpes zoster in 1, cytomegalovirus in 1 and other in 5. Mean estimated creatinine clearance plus or minus standard deviation was similar in the infection and control groups at the beginning of the study (51 +/- 22 and 51 +/- 23 ml. per minute, respectively). During the infectious episode mean creatinine clearance significantly decreased to 38 +/- 17 ml. per minute in the infection group. After infection resolved creatinine clearance returned to an almost baseline mean value of 50 +/- 23 ml. per minute. However, after 2 years of followup there was a significant difference in mean creatinine clearance in the infection group versus controls (45 +/- 25 versus 52 +/- 25 ml. per minute, p = 0.022).",
        "To our knowledge we have shown for the first time in a prospective controlled study that febrile infectious episodes correlate with poor long-term renal graft function."
