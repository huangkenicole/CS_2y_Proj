        "Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) is a three-item clinical instrument for bedside identification of sepsis patients at risk of poor outcome. qSOFA could be a valuable triage tool in emergency departments of low-income countries, yet its performance in resource-limited settings remains unknown. The prognostic accuracy of qSOFA for 28-day all-cause mortality in febrile adults treated at the EDs in a low-income country was evaluated.",
        "Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients (\u226518 years) with fever (tympanic temperature \u226538\u00b0C and fever \u22647 days) who presented between July 2013 and May 2014 at four emergency departments in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Medical history, clinical examination, laboratory and microbiological data were collected to document the cause of fever. Variables for the previous and new sepsis criteria were collected at inclusion and qSOFA, SOFA and SIRS were measured at inclusion. Patients were followed up by phone at day 28. The performance (sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC]) of qSOFA (score \u22652), SOFA (increase of \u22652 points) and SIRS (\u22652 criteria) as predictors of 28-day all-cause mortality was evaluated.",
        "Among the 519 patients (median age: 30 years) included in the analysis, 47% were female and 25% were HIV positive. Overall, 85% had a microbiologically and/or clinically documented infection and 15% a fever of unknown origin. The most common site and causes of infections were the respiratory tract (43%), dengue (26%), malaria (6%) and typhoid fever (5%). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 6%: 3% for patients with a qSOFA <2 and 24% for those with a score \u22652 (absolute difference, 21%; 95% CI 12%-31%). The prognostic accuracy of qSOFA (AUROC 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87) for 28-day mortality was similar to SOFA (AUROC 0.79, 0.71-0.87; p = 0.1) and better than SIRS (AUROC 0.61, 0.52-0.71; p<0.001).",
        "Among patients with fever at emergency departments in Tanzania, qSOFA had a prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality comparable to SOFA and superior to SIRS. These results support the use of qSOFA as a triage tool to identify patients with sepsis and at risk of poor outcome in resource-limited countries.",
