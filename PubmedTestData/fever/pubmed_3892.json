        "Hyperthermia has been known to induce malformations in numerous animal models as well being associated with human abnormalities. This was apparent particularly when the hyperthermia exposure was during the early stages of neural development. Although it was recognized relatively early that these exposures induced cell death, the specific molecular mechanism of how a brief heat exposure was translated in to specific cellular functions remains largely unknown. While our understanding of the events that govern how cells react to heat, or stresses in general, has increased, there is much that remains undiscovered. In this brief review, animal and clinical observations are outlined as are some of the scientific explorations that were undertaken to characterize, define, and better understand the morphological, biochemical, and molecular effects of hyperthermia on the developing embryo."
