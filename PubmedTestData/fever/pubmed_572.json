        "We sought to determine whether therapeutic temperature modulation (TTM) to treat fever after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with improved hospital complications and discharge outcomes.",
        "We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients admitted with spontaneous ICH having two consecutive fevers \u226538.3 \u00b0C despite acetaminophen administration. Cases were enrolled from a prospective database of patients receiving TTM from 2006 to 2010. All cases received TTM for fever control with goal temperature of 37 \u00b0C with a shiver-control protocol. Controls were matched in severity by ICH score and retrospectively obtained from 2001 to 2004, before routine use of TTM for ICH. Primary outcome was discharge-modified Rankin score.",
        "Forty patients were enrolled in each group. Median admission ICH Score, ICH volume, and GCS were similar. TTM was initiated with a median of 3 days after ICH onset and for a median duration of 7 days. Mean daily T max was significantly higher in the control group over the first 12 days (38.1 vs. 38.7 \u00b0C, p \u2264 0.001). The TTM group had more days of IV sedation (median 8 vs. 1, p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (18 vs. 9, p = 0.003), and more frequently underwent tracheostomy (55 vs. 23 %, p = 0.005). Mean NICU length of stay was longer for TTM patients (15 vs. 11 days, p = 0.007). There was no difference in discharge outcomes between the two groups (overall mortality 33 %, moderate or severe disability 67 %).",
        "Therapeutic normothermia is associated with increased duration of sedation, mechanical ventilation, and NICU stay, but is not clearly associated with improved discharge outcome."
