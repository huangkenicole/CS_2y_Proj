        "Data obtained from the Saskatchewan Central Feed Test Station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada were examined for evidence of factors related to average daily gain and the diseases occurring in 326 beef bulls during the 1983-84 test. Average daily gain was found to be significantly associated with breed, pen assignment and initial test weight but was not associated with disease or age upon arrival at the test station. Lameness was associated with breed and initial weight, while fever (suspected respiratory disease) was associated with age. The predicted odds of lameness was approximately seven times greater in the animal with the heaviest as compared to the lightest initial test weight and the predicted odds of fever was approximately five times greater in the youngest as compared to the oldest animal."
