        "1. Metabolic responses of endotoxin-injected newborn rabbits were measured in a closed circuit calorimeter at a constant environmental temperature within their thermoneutral range. Oxygen consumption and colonic temperatures were then measured over a range of environmental temperatures from 21.0 to 40.0 degrees C and the responses of endotoxin-injected rabbits compared with non-injected litter mates. 2. To measure their preferred thermal environment, endotoxin-injected and non-injected litter mates were allowed to settle on a thermal gradient and their colonic temperatures measured. 3. In a constant environmental temperature of 37 degrees C, rises in oxygen consumption and colonic temperature following endotoxin injection were found to be biphasic. Oxygen consumption rose from 21 ml kg-1 min-1 to a maximum 35 ml kg-1 min-1 and colonic temperature rose from 39.0 to 39.8 degrees C. 4. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption was the same in both injected and non-injected animals, 53 ml kg-1 min-1, being provoked at the same environmental temperature of 24 degrees C. Minimal rates of oxygen consumption were also similar for the two groups but in the injected animals they were achieved at an environmental temperature of 39 degrees C, 2 degrees C higher than for non-injected animals. 5. We conclude that newborn rabbits challenged with a pyrogen have both behavioural and physiological responses. The thermogenic response is consistent with a change in sensitivity to feedback information rather than a simple shift in the central thermoregulatory set point. We find no evidence to support the view that in the febrile response a higher body temperature necessitates an increase in metabolic rate, the so-called Q10 effect."
