        "To assess the common practices for evaluating and treating febrile infants aged \u226460 days in a nationwide survey.",
        "Questionnaires were administrated to inpatient paediatric departments in all 25 hospitals in Israel.",
        "Of the 25 centres surveyed (100% response rate), only 36% had written protocols concerning the approach to young febrile infants. The existence of a written protocol was significantly associated with the level of medical centre (tertiary versus primary and secondary, p = 0.041) and with the number of local paediatric infectious disease specialists (p = 0.034). In 13 (52%) hospitals, a normal white blood cell count was defined as 5000-15 000 cells/mL and 20 (80%) centres use C-reactive protein. Hospitalisation was mandatory in most (96%) centres for all neonates aged \u226428 days. Low-risk infants aged 29-60 days were hospitalised in 68.4% of the primary and secondary hospitals, compared with 33.3% tertiary centres. Ampicillin and gentamicin was the routine empiric antibiotic treatment for febrile infant in 92% of centres.",
        "Significant differences exist among centres in the evaluation of febrile infants aged \u226460 days exist. These differences reflect the lack of, and highlight the need for, national or international guidelines for the evaluation of fever in this age group."
