        "The surveillance system was based on the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rates of febrile neutropenia were calculated for neutropenic patient-days (ie, days with neutropenia < 500/microL).",
        "From January 1997 through December 1999 and from February 2000 through January 2003, 58 and 54 patients endured 237 and 184 neutropenic periods following chemotherapy, and their total neutropenic days were 3,123 and 2,503, respectively. They showed episodes of febrile neutropenia 89 and 68 times, respectively. Infection rates were 28.5 and 27.2 per 1,000 neutropenic patient-days (P = .83), respectively.",
        "The incidence of febrile neutropenia was not affected by footwear exchange. In hematology units, changing shoes does not appear to affect the rate of infections during neutropenic periods."
