        "Febrile illnesses are common clinical problems for the family physician. A questionnaire study was conducted of 100 adult patients in a family practice clinic to gain understanding of their knowledge about fever and its management. Many misconceptions were documented among adult patients about their own fevers and those of children for whom they cared. Misconceptions included the conviction that fever is more dangerous in children than in adults and a distorted concern about bodily damage from fever. Patients demonstrated a poor understanding of normal body temperature, minimum and maximum febrile temperatures, and minimum temperatures warranting antipyresis. Though many owned thermometers, they indicated improper usage and demonstrated inaccurate temperature-reading technique. Questionnaire responses indicated that health care providers had done poorly in educating patients about fever, its consequences, and its proper treatment."
