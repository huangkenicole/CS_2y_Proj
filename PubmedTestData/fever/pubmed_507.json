        "The applied value of serum hepcidin in differential diagnosis of infection fevers versus tumor fevers was explored. A total of 432 fever patients were selected according to the domestic fever of unknown origin (FUO) diagnostic criteria from our hospital between June 2010 and November 2013. Venous blood samples were taken on the day 1, 5, 10 after admission. The infection group (98 cases) and the tumor group (50 cases) were set up based on the clinical and laboratory findings. ELISA was used to determine the serum hepcidin and IL-6 levels. SPSS 13.0 was used for statistical analysis. Hepcidin showed obvious descending trend on the 10th day in both the bacterial infection group (66 cases) and the virus infection group (32 cases), and the descending trend was similar to that of inflammatory indexes such as procalcitonin (PCT), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (h-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell (WBC), and ferritin. Serum hepcidin showed no obvious differences in the tumor group on the day 1, 5, 10 after admission. In the infection groups, serum hepcidin was positively correlated with IL-6 (r=0.687, P=0.000) and CRP (r=0.487, P=0.026), but had a poor correlation with blood sedimentation, ferritin, PCT and WBC (P>0.05). Monitoring dynamic changes of hepcidin and related inflammatory factors in patients with fever is expected to be used for clinical identification of infection fever and tumor fever."
