        "The effect of endogenous pyrogen (EP, from rabbit) and endotoxin (Salmonella typhosa) on rectal temperature (Tre) was investigated in normal and dehydrated rats of both sexes. Intraperitoneal injection of either EP or endotoxin did not affect body temperature. In addition, no changes in Tre were observed when endotoxin was injected intravenously in normally hydrated male rats, but significant falls in Tre occurred in normal female rats. However, intravenous injection of EP produced fever in both sexes, but females generally showed smaller responses. A second intravenous injection of endotoxin, given 3 days after the first injection, always produced fever in normally hydrated rats. The pattern of this febrile response was monophasic. In contrast to the response in normal rats, intravenous endotoxin produced significant fevers with a biphasic pattern in dehydrated rats of either sex, but the febrile responses of male rats were greater than those of female rats. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between febrile responses to intravenous EP exhibited by normal and dehydrated animals. These results show that rats of both sexes possess physiological mechanisms capable of producing a fever following intravenous injections of EP."
