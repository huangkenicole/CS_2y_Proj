        "We have compared the characteristics of fevers produced by endogenous pyrogen administered by the intravenous (iv) and by the intracerebroventricular (icv) routes in conscious rabbits. Fevers induced by the intracerebroventricular route have a longer latency to onset, a less steep rise in body temperature, and a longer time to peak elevation in body temperature than do fevers induced by the intravenous route. Furthermore, a dose of indomethacin (2 mg/kg) administered intravenously, which is effective in markedly attenuating fevers produced by the intravenous route, was completely without effect on fevers induced by the intracerebroventricular route. On the other hand, when indomethacin (500 micrograms) was infused intracerebroventricularly, it markedly reduced fevers induced by the subsequent injection of endogenous pyrogen into the contralateral cerebral ventricle, but such pretreatment had little effect on fevers elicited by intravenous injections of endogenous pyrogen. It is concluded that the sites of action of endogenous pyrogen in response to intravenous injections of pyrogen are different from those responding to intracerebroventricular injections of pyrogen and that this is manifest in several distinct differences in the characteristics of the two fevers. These results indicate that the intracerebroventricular model of fever production is not appropriate for the study of the normal pathogenesis of fever."
