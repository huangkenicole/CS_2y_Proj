        "Fever is common in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Empiric antibiotic (EA) therapy is initiated and often continued until neutrophil engraftment. Prolonged antibiotic exposure reduces microbiome diversity and causes overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, leading to such complications as infections from antibiotic-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile colitis. Shorter courses of EA therapy have been studied in adults undergoing HCT without significant safety concerns, but data in children are lacking. We instituted a single-center preintervention/ postintervention quality improvement (QI) project to assess the feasibility of short-course EA therapy for first fever in patients undergoing HCT. We aimed to reduce the median duration of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in eligible patients from 20 days in 2020 to 10 days in 2021. Patients were eligible for the intervention, limiting EAs to 7 days for first fever, if they were admitted for their first allogeneic HCT, were afebrile for >24 hours, had no infection requiring systemic treatment, and were hemodynamically stable. Outcome measures included days of EA therapy for first fever and total broad-spectrum antibiotic use during the period of hospitalization, defined as the time from the start of conditioning to 30 days after HCT or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Balancing measures included bloodstream infection (BSI), fever, and intensive care (ICU) admission within 3 days of stopping EA therapy. Project criteria were applied retrospectively to patients who underwent HCT in 2020 to construct a preintervention short-course-eligible cohort. During the intervention period, 41 patients underwent allogeneic HCT, of whom 17 (41%) were eligible for short-course EA therapy. Among eligible patients, the median age was 5.3 years, 47% had an underlying malignancy, and 88% received myeloablative conditioning. There were no differences in demographic or HCT characteristics between patients eligible for short-course EA during the intervention and preintervention period (n\u00a0=\u00a024). The short-course EA schedule was adhered to by 14 of the 17 eligible patients (82%). The duration of EA for first fever and total broad-spectrum antibiotic use was significantly decreased in the short-course EA-eligible patients compared to the preintervention cohort, from a median of 17 days to 8 days and from 20 days to 10 days, respectively (P < .01). Of the 14 patients adhering to short-course EA, 2 experienced a balancing measure of recurrent fever requiring resumption of EA, but no infection was identified. There were no BSIs, ICU admissions, or deaths during the hospitalization period in patients who received short-course EA. In this single-center QI project, short-course EA for initial fever was successfully applied to children undergoing allogeneic HCT using strict criteria and led to a significant decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotic use during hospitalization. These results should be validated in a prospective clinical trial to include the impact of short-course EA on antibiotic-resistant organisms, the intestinal microbiome, and HCT outcomes."
