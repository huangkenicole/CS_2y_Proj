        "Early prediction of bloodstream infections (BSI) among obstetric patients remains to be a challenge for clinicians. The objective of this study was to develop a risk score and assess its discriminative ability in febrile obstetric patients in a maternal intensive care unit (ICU).",
        "Between May 2015 and August 2020, a total of 497 febrile obstetric patients were categorized into BSI group (n\u2009=\u2009276) and Non-BSI group (n\u2009=\u2009221) based on the result of blood cultures. White blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), time of interval from amniorrhea to fever (IFAF) and maximum body temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) were compared between the two groups. All patients were divided into training set (n\u2009=\u2009298) and validation set (n\u2009=\u2009199). The risk score was established using univariate and multivariate logistic regression from patients in the training set, and its discriminative ability was tested among patients in the validation set.",
        "The levels of neutrophil, CRP, PCT, IFAF and T<sub>max</sub> were significantly higher in BSI group than those in Non-BSI group. PROM, T<sub>max</sub>, neutrophil and CRP acted as independent predictive factors for BSI in the training set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of risk score for early prediction of BSI in the training, validation set and the whole population was 0.829 (95% CI 0.783-0.876), 0.848 (95% CI 0.792-0.903) and 0.838 (95% CI 0.803-0.873), respectively.",
        "The risk score has a feasible discriminatory ability in early prediction of BSI in febrile obstetric patients."
