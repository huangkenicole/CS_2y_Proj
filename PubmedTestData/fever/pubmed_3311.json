        "Monitoring of body temperature is an important clinical procedure in the care of sick children, especially the under-5 children, as many disease conditions present with fever. The oral mercury-in-glass thermometer which has relatively good accuracy cannot be used in children less than 5 years because it requires their cooperation.",
        "This study was aimed at using the infrared tympanic thermometer (IRTT) in oral mode to measure temperature in febrile and afebrile children less than 5 years.",
        "Rectal and tympanic temperatures were measured consecutively in 400 febrile and 400 afebrile under-5 children matched for age, using the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the IRTT in oral mode respectively.",
        "In the febrile children, the mean tympanic temperature was 38.6 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C, while the mean rectal temperature was 39.0 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C. In the afebrile group, the mean tympanic temperature was 37.0 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, while the mean rectal temperature was 37.4 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C. The mean difference between rectal and tympanic temperatures in both groups was statistically significant. There was good correlation between the two temperatures. The tympanic thermometer used in the oral mode had a sensitivity of 87.3% and a specificity of 96.5%.",
        "The IRTT (oral mode) may not be reliable in estimating 'core' body temperature in children under the age of five years, but with a fairly good sensitivity and specificity, as well as its other advantages such as short duration of measurement, convenience and safety, it is a useful instrument for screening children with fever in a busy setup."
