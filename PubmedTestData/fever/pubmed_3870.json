        "To use continuous real-time monitoring of maternal core body temperature during labor and investigate the association between epidural analgesia, intrapartum maternal fever, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.",
        "Among 201 pregnant women attending our institution for a vaginal in-hospital delivery, 159 women received epidural analgesia and 42 women did not receive epidural analgesia. Women's core body temperature was continuously monitored for the duration of labor using a smartphone/iPad-connected wireless thermometer positioned in an axilla. The primary outcome was a change in maternal core body temperature during labor. Among women receiving epidural analgesia, maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared in women who developed an intrapartum fever and those who had no intrapartum temperature elevation.",
        "Of the women receiving epidural analgesia, 26.4% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200942/159) developed intrapartum fever \u226538\u2009\u00b0C compared to 7.1% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20093/42) of women not receiving epidural analgesia. Among those receiving epidural analgesia, women who developed intrapartum fever had a significantly longer first stage of labor and a higher incidence of cesarean section, assisted vaginal delivery, intrapartum hemorrhage, and turbid amniotic fluid compared to women with no intrapartum temperature elevation. Neonates of women who developed intrapartum fever had lower 1- and 5-min Apgar scores compared to neonates of women with no intrapartum temperature elevation; however, the difference was not significant.",
        "This study used a precise and accurate method to monitor core body temperature among women receiving epidural analgesia. Results showed that the use of epidural analgesia during labor was associated with intrapartum maternal fever in all stages of labor. Fever after epidural analgesia was associated with adverse maternal outcomes, independent of neonatal complications."
