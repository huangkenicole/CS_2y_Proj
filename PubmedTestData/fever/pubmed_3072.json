        "Hyperthermia is most dangerous clinical symptom of acute MDMA administration, and a key factor related to potentially life-threatening MDMA-induced complications. MDMA induces a consistently faster onset of brain hyperthermia when compared to a delayed and moderate hyperthermia in the body, and the most harmful effects of MDMA are related to its modulation of neural functions. The primary focus of this study was to investigate the effects of minocycline, a centrally acting tetracycline derivative on MDMA-induced brain hyperthermia at high ambient temperature. However, we also simultaneously recorded body temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity changes, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the MDMA-induced hyperthermic response. We also investigated the effects of MDMA at normal ambient temperature to provide further evidence as to the importance of environmental factors on the intensity of MDMA's temperature effects. At normal ambient temperature, MDMA (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) induced a significant brain and body hypothermia for the first 90\u202fmin following drug administration, and significantly increased heart rate and locomotor activity compared to saline controls. At high ambient temperature however, MDMA (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) induced a robust and extended brain and body hyperthermia, as well as significantly increased heart rate and locomotor activity. A 3-day minocycline (50\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment significantly attenuated MDMA-induced increases in brain temperature, body temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity. Our findings indicate that minocycline is more effective in attenuating the exacerbated MDMA-induced hyperthermic response in the brain compared to the body at high ambient temperature."
