        "Autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by recurrent fevers and clinical findings of impaired natural immunity and can involve various organ systems. The concept of autoinflammatory disease emerged after the definition of familial Mediterranean fever and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome. This new disease group was considered to differ from the standard concept of autoimmune diseases, which is relatively better known in terms of basic features, such as defects in innate immunity and the absence of antibodies. A better understanding has been achieved regarding the genetic and pathogenetic mechanisms of this relatively new disease group over the past 20 years since they were first diagnosed, which have led to some changes in the concept of autoinflammatory diseases. The recent definition classifies autoinflammatory disease to be a wide range of diseases with different clinical features, mainly accompanied by changes in innate immune and rarely in humoral immunity. The spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases is rapidly expanding owing to recent developments in molecular sciences and genetics. This review article discusses the clinical features, classification criteria, treatment options, and long-term prognosis of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome, and other common autoinflammatory diseases in the light of current literature."
