        "to achieve the sustainable development goal for child survival, we must better understand the socioeconomic characteristics, household behaviors and access to community health services which predict care utilization for children. This study assessed predictors of health care utilization for children under five in Migori County, Kenya.",
        "we used multivariable logistic regression in the context of an integrated health intervention which employed paid, trained, and supervised community health workers (CHWs), inclusive of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). The intervention was delivered with Ministry of Health in one of five geographies included in the study.",
        "community health workers (CHW) home visits were associated with a two-fold increase in care seeking for children with respiratory symptoms. Following implementation of a CHW-led malaria intervention, the use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests increased, while fever prevalence decreased. Households in the intervention area were three times more likely to seek care for their child\u00b4s fever. Increased care utilization for children with fever was positively associated with male partner attendance at antenatal care visits and negatively associated with skilled delivery and recognition of warning signs. Care utilization for respiratory symptoms was positively associated with caregiver education and negatively associated with household size. Care utilization for diarrhea was positively associated with having a recent under-five death in the household.",
        "the study suggests that trained and motivated CHWs may be an effective tool for improving care utilization for children. Further, the study builds on evidence of male partner involvement and caregiver education as predictors of child care utilization."
