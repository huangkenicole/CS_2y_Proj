        "Sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay (SIFD) syndrome is a serious autosomal recessive genetic disease. So far, <40 cases have been reported worldwide, and only one case has been reported in China. The main clinical features of SIFD are sideroblastic or microcytic anemia, immune deficiency, and recurrent episodes of inflammation. Here, we describe two unrelated cases of SIFD from China with different clinical manifestations and mild symptoms. Patient 1 was hospitalized at the age of 3.5\u00a0years due to persistent joint swelling with imaging of multiple joint effusions. Patient 2 was hospitalized at the age of 12\u00a0years due to repeated rashes on both lower limbs and oral ulcers. SIFD was detected using gene testing, which revealed the following compound heterozygous variants in TRNT1 in cases 1 and 2, respectively: c.88A\u00a0>\u00a0G/c.363G\u00a0>\u00a0T and c.302\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C/c.1234cC\u00a0>\u00a0T. Searches of the HGMD databases revealed that these variants were all novel. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the missense variants c.363G\u00a0>\u00a0T and c.302\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C would cause changes in protein structure and thus affect protein function. Finally, through literature reviewing, we found that the mortality in cases of SIFD was approximately 44% (14/32), and about 79% of individuals who died carried the hot-spot mutation c.668\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C. Moreover, variants in the non-coding region were significantly more common among patients who died than among survivors. Our cases further expand the existing knowledge of the phenotype and variation spectrums of SIFD and suggest that genomic diagnosis is valuable for the hierarchical clinical management of this disease."
