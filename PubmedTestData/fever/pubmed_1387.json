      "AbstractText": [
        "Indigenous populations are represented among the poor and disadvantaged in rural areas. High rates of infectious diseases are observed in indigenous child populations, and fever as a general symptom is common.",
        "We aim to improve the skills of healers in rural indigenous areas in the South of Ecuador for managing children with fevers.",
        "We performed participatory action research (PAR) for this study with 65 healers.",
        "The PAR focused on the following four phases: (1) 'observation,' eight focus groups were used. (2) 'planning' phase was developed, and with culturally reflective peer group sessions, a culturally adapted flowchart was constructed titled \"Management of children with fever.\" In phase (3): 'action', the healers were trained to manage children with fever. Phase (4): 'evaluation', 50% of the healers used the flowchart.",
        "Explicit recognition of the need for traditional healers and health professionals in indigenous communities to work together to improve health indicators such as infant mortality exists. Additionally, strengthening the transfer system in rural areas is based on knowledge and cooperation between the community and the biomedical system."
