        "Clinical information were collected on 294 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) whose syndrome and National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score were checked at baseline (within the first 3-day admission) and at 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after admission to our clinical research centre. We explored the effect of phlegm-heat syndrome on the degree of neurological deficit following stroke by applying a repeated measures analysis of variance.",
        "Stroke patients with phlegm-heat syndrome had higher NIHSS score than patients without the syndrome (P <0.01), and there appeared to be a decrease in NIHSS score over time in all patients (P <0.01).",
