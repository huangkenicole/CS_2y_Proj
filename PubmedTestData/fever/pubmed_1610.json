      "AbstractText": [
        "Fever is one of the most common presenting complaints among infants brought to pediatric emergency. Although most of the infants have benign, self-limiting viral infections, approximately 10% of all may have serious bacterial infection. Clinical examination alone is insufficient to detect serious bacterial infection in well appearing infants, and a standardized approach is always sought for. However, guidelines used in the United States or European countries may not be applicable in a tropical country like India. Deviation from these guidelines leads to challenges of unwarranted hospitalization and antibiotic usage, extra cost of care and risk of antimicrobial resistance. Various prediction rules can detect a low risk infant with negative predictive values ranging from 93.7-100%. While use of biomarkers such as C reactive protein and procalcitonin can be reliable, it is costly and may not be applicable to the local population. Validation studies over varied population are needed in future."
