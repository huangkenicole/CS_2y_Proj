        "To assess whether pulse perfusion index (PI) values could be employed to predict intrapartum fever and to provide a cut-off PI value for predicting intrapartum fever occurrence.",
        "We conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study.",
        "Delivery room at the Department of Obstetrics, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University.",
        "117 parturients who intended to have a vaginal delivery.",
        "Each parturient received epidural analgesia.",
        "We checked each parturient's tympanic temperature before analgesia (T<sub>0</sub>), at 1\u00a0h (T<sub>1</sub>) and 2\u00a0h (T<sub>2</sub>) after analgesia, immediately at the end of the second (T<sub>3</sub>) and third (T<sub>4</sub>) stages of labor, and at 1\u00a0h postpartum (T<sub>5</sub>). A temperature of \u226538\u00b0C was defined as fever. PI, measured on the right second toe, was recorded before analgesia (PI<sub>0</sub>) and at 10\u00a0min (PI<sub>10</sub>), 20\u00a0min (PI<sub>20</sub>), and 30\u00a0min (PI<sub>30</sub>) after analgesia. The PI change rate was calculated as the incremental change in PI<sub>30</sub> from PI<sub>0</sub>, divided by the PI<sub>0</sub>. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to verify the utility of the PI<sub>30</sub> and PI change rate values for predicting intrapartum fever.",
        "We found that peak temperature (T<sub>P</sub>) occurred at the end of the second or the third stage of labor. Within 30\u00a0min after analgesia, the PI showed a significant increase over time and there was a linear correlation between PI<sub>30</sub> and T<sub>P</sub> values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.544). The PI<sub>10</sub>, PI<sub>20</sub>, PI<sub>30</sub> and PI change rate in febrile parturients were higher than those in afebrile parturients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The area under the ROC (AUROC) for PI<sub>30</sub> was 0.818 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with a cut-off of 9.30. The AUROC of the PI change rate was 0.738 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with a cut-off of 3.45.",
