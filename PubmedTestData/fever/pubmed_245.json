        "Children with cancer require central venous access which carries risk for line-related infections. The necessity of peripheral and central blood cultures is debated for those with fevers. We evaluated and described results for first episode of paired blood cultures from children with cancer who have a central venous line using retrospective database. Blood culture results, laboratory data, and medical outcomes were included. Descriptive analyses of blood culture results and clinical data were performed. There were 190 episodes of paired positive blood cultures with 167 true positive episodes. Of the true positive episodes, 104 (62.3%) were positive in both central and peripheral cultures, 42 (25.1%) were positive in central only cultures, and 21 (12.6%) were positive in peripheral cultures only. Intensive care unit admission within 48 hours after blood cultures (n=33) differed significantly: 28.7% for both central and peripheral, 10% for central only, and 0% for peripheral only (P=0.009). Central line removal (n=34) differed by type of positivity but was not significant: 22.1% for both central and peripheral, 23.8% for central only, and 4.8% for peripheral only (P=0.15). Peripheral blood cultures provided important medical information yet had differences in short-term clinical outcomes. Further evaluation of medical decision making is warranted."
