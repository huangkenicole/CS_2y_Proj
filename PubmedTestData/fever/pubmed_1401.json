        "To study the fever perception and self-care of pharmacy personnel as well as the information given to customers about the management of fever problems, a random sample of 152 Norwegian pharmacists and 150 pharmacy technicians were interviewed, in 1989, by a national opinion poll company. One-third thought that body temperatures between 39.0 degrees C and 40.5 degrees C could be life-threatening. Of all respondents 24% (33% of technicians, 16% of pharmacists) assumed body temperatures to be rising when sweating accompanied fever. In cases of common cold or influenza accompanied by fever 56% of the personnel would use antipyretics. 7% Of the staff (14% of technicians, 1% of pharmacists) believed penicillin to be effective against viral infections. Antipyretic drug preferences were consistent, but a wide range of perceptions was revealed, in particular with respect to start of antipyretic therapy and seeking medical care for children. Undergraduate and postgraduate education of pharmacy personnel should aim more at satisfying the demand for information of the general public and focus more on the symptomatic treatment of fever and minor illness in general. Pharmacists in charge have a special responsibility in counselling their assistants."
