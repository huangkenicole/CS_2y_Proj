        "This section focuses on issues in infectious disease that are commonly encountered in pediatric office practices. Dr. McCarthy discusses recent literature regarding the evaluation and management of acute fevers without apparent source on clinical examination in infants and children and the evaluation of children with prolonged fevers of unknown origin. Drs. Klig and Chen (pp 121-126) review recent literature about lower respiratory infection in children. This section focuses on febrile children in whom a source of fever is not readily apparent on clinical examination. This issue is discussed in several contexts: recent developments concerning the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and therapy of febrile illnesses; children from 3 to 36 months of age with fever; infants younger than 90 days of age with fever; and children of any age with prolonged fever, usually lasting more than 7 to 10 days, for whom a diagnosis has not been established."
