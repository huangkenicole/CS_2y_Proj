        "We reported recently that the complement (C) system may play a role in the febrile response of guinea pigs to intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration because C depletion abolished the LPS-induced rise in core temperature (T(c)). The present study was designed to investigate further the relation between C reduction [induced by cobra venom factor (CVF); 20, 50, 100, and 200 U/animal iv] and the fever of adult, conscious guinea pigs produced by LPS injected intravenously (2 microg/kg) or intraperitoneally (8, 16, 32 microg/kg) 18 h after CVF; control animals received pyrogen-free saline. Serum C levels were measured as total hemolytic C activity before and 18 h after CVF injection and expressed as CH(100) units. In other experiments, serum C levels were determined at various intervals after the intravenous and intraperitoneal injections at different doses of LPS alone. LPS produced fevers generally of similar heights but of different onset latencies and durations, depending on the dose and route of administration. CVF caused dose-related reductions in serum C, from approximately 1,136 U to below detection. These reductions proportionately attenuated the fevers induced by intraperitoneal LPS, but not by intravenous LPS. Intravenous and intraperitoneal LPS per se caused reductions in serum C of 25 and 40%, respectively, indicating activation of the C cascade. These decreases were transient, however, occurring early during the febrile rise approximately 30 min after LPS injection. These data thus support the notion that the C system may be critically involved in the febrile response of guinea pigs to systemic, particularly intraperitoneal, LPS."
