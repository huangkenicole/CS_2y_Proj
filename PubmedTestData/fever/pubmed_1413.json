        "Fever is the most common problem in medical situations, but controversy still surrounds its benefit/ risk ratio for human beings. Fever is therefore always over-managed, and there is no consistency in management approaches to it. This article discusses fever management through the concept of evidence- based nursing, and provides a reference for clinical nursing. From the starting point of understanding the definition of fever and its physiological reactions, the benefit/risk ratio and management suggestion are discussed. Medical staff are expected to be able to use evidence in deciding approaches to clinical fever management, and to provide correct information with an appropriate attitude to the patient's family members, so that both medical staff and patients can enjoy consistent recognition of and management approaches to fever."
