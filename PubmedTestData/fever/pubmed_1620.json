        "Fever occurs frequently early after pancreas transplant, however, the exact cause is often undetermined. Limited data are available on pancreas recipients experiencing unexplained, noninfectious fever. This study aims to characterize unexplained fever (UF) in pancreas recipients and its effect on patient and graft outcomes.",
        "We performed a retrospective cohort study of UF among consecutive pancreas or simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant recipients from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2015. Classification of UF was based on the absence of positive cultures, radiologic findings, and other diagnostic features of infection or rejection.",
        "Twenty-three of 92 (25%) patients experienced UF. The UF episode first occurred at a mean of 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0days post-transplant and accounted for 34 admissions with an average length of stay of 5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0days. Intravenous corticosteroid was administered following confirmation of negative diagnostic tests in 77% of patients, with fever resolution occurring in all. No differences were seen in rates of biopsy-proven rejection, graft loss, death, or documented infections compared to UF-free patients during the first-year post-transplant.",
        "UF is a common cause for readmission following pancreas transplantation. While the etiology of UF remains difficult to identify, UF occurrence was not associated with adverse outcomes during the first-year post-transplant."
