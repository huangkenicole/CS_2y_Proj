        "The records of 1,941 consecutive patients-victims of an internal armed conflict-admitted and treated over a period of 12 months at the surgical hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross are analyzed retrospectively. They are divided in two groups: those with \"fever\" and those with \"no fever.\" Patients are classified as having fever when the orally measured temperature is 39.0 degrees C or more for 2 or more subsequent days. The study indicates that fever is associated with the outcome in terms of an increase in the number of operations, the use of blood, the number of days in the hospital, and mortality, Surgeons working in internal armed conflicts without microbiological testing facilities have to consider fever as an important indicator for the clinical condition of their patients."
