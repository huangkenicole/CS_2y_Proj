        "To investigate their perception of fever problems, self-care and information given to patients, a random sample of 100 Norwegian general practitioners were interviewed in 1989-1990 by telephone. More than two-thirds of the general practitioners would define fever as a body temperature above 38.0 degrees C. One-third would wait with antipyretic drug therapy for children until the temperature was above 39.5 degrees C. When dealing with fever in their own children, one-third would not follow their own recommendations to parents with febrile children. 43% Had not discussed guidelines for the management of febrile patients with their receptionists. Only 7% had discussed such guidelines with the local pharmacists. Lack of consistency in the information given to patients may result in confusing advice. General practitioners, their receptionists and the local pharmacists should discuss and define guidelines for fever management and information to patients and parents. These should include information about antipyretic therapy and consultation behaviour."
