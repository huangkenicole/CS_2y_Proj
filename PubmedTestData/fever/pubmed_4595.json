        "The objectives of this study were to understand the clinical presentations of febrile young infants with severe bacterial infection (SBI), and to investigate the pathogen variations throughout the vaccine era and after antenatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening.All infants\u200a<\u200a90\u200adays old with a body temperature of \u226538.0\u00b0C and admitted to the emergency department were retrospectively enrolled in our study. SBI was defined as a positive culture of urine, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid. All clinical variables were analyzed and compared between the SBI group and the non-SBI group, to identify the relevant risk factors for SBI in infants with pyrexia.A total of 498 infants were studied, 279 of whom (56%) had SBI. The body temperature at triage was higher in the SBI group, and the difference was highly obvious in the neonatal group. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were both significantly higher in the SBI group (P\u200a<\u200a.05), whereas neutrophil percentage and band percentage demonstrated no significant differences. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen and plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum lactamases were detected in up to 9.1%. GBS was detected in 16 cases of bacteremia (6 cases with concurrent meningitis).The body temperature at triage may provide a clue for differentiating sick babies, especially in the neonatal group. Complete serum analysis is required for infection survey, especially white blood cell and C-reactive protein. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen, and clinician should raise awareness of drug resistance in some patients. The prevalence of GBS infection in the young infant group remains high after routine antenatal GBS screening."
