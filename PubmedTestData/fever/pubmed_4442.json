        "A 59-year-old woman sought treatment for 5\u00a0weeks of progressive exercise intolerance. At the time of presentation, dyspnea limited her ability to speak in complete sentences. She also reported new orthopnea. Her respiratory symptoms improved with rest and while standing. She endorsed associated intermittent low-grade fevers, cough productive of scant clear sputum, lower extremity swelling, bloating, weight loss, and reduced appetite. She had undergone two recent admissions with similar symptoms to other hospitals, during which she was treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia and discharged after workups for infectious disease were unrevealing. She had a history notable for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed in 2006, complicated by lupus nephritis in 2009. Most recently, her SLE had been quiescent while she was taking hydroxychloroquine (400\u00a0mg daily) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 1\u00a0g twice daily). She reported baseline mild dyspnea with exertion since she received a diagnosis of SLE, but her symptoms had not previously affected her activities of daily living. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs, and her family history was unremarkable."
