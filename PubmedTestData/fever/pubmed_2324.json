        "In women undergoing major gynecologic surgery, we wish to determine the frequency and yield of blood culture, urine culture, and chest X-ray evaluation of postoperative fever.",
        "A retrospective review of 537 consecutive patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery was performed. In patients who developed postoperative fever, it was determined whether blood culture, urine culture, and/or chest X-ray were performed, and, if so, the frequency of positive results was evaluated.",
        "Two hundred eleven patients (39%) developed postoperative fever. Blood cultures were obtained in 77 of 211 (37%) febrile patients, urine cultures in 106 of 211 (50%) febrile patients, and chest X-ray in 54 of 211 (26%) febrile patients. Zero of 77 blood cultures were positive, 11 of 106 (10%) urine cultures were positive, and 5 of 54 (9%) chest X-rays were positive. Logistic regression revealed that late onset fever predicted for positive urine cultures and early onset fever and advanced age predicted for pneumonia. Eighty percent of patients with pneumonia were symptomatic. In 92% of patients with postoperative fever, no infections or pathologic process were diagnosed.",
        "Although postoperative fever is frequently evaluated by blood culture, urine culture, and chest X-ray, evaluation rarely yields positive results."
