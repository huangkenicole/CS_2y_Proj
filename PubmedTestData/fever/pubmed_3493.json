        "Many parents of young, febrile children lack evidence-based tools to manage fever (knowledge, skills, confidence, support), fear negative outcomes, and prioritize the reduction of fever over management of its source. This review examines the literature for evidence of factors that must be considered when designing effective fever management educational interventions for parents, especially those whose health literacy is low.",
        "A systematic search identified studies from 1980 to 2011 using the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Review, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Medline Plus, Joanna Briggs Institute, and Google Scholar.",
        "The most effective educational interventions are 1:1, multidimensional, structured, relevant, and reinforced over time. Parental culture, health literacy, knowledge deficits, and beliefs must be addressed by nurse practitioners (NPs) to maximize evidence-based behaviors.",
        "Parents often strive to do what is best for their child but may become overly protective and anxious when managing their child's fever. NPs have a prime opportunity to improve parents' fever management practices. An evidence-based toolkit, created with respect for those who may have low health literacy, will give parents tangible tools to help them provide safer and less costly care for their febrile child."
