        "The recent increase in the frequency and intensity of killer heat waves across the globe has aroused worldwide medical attention to exploring therapeutic strategies to attenuate heat-related morbidity and/or mortality. Death due to heat-related illnesses often exceeds >50% of heat victims. Those who survive are crippled with lifetime disabilities and exhibit profound cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunction akin to premature neurodegeneration. Although more than 50% of the world populations are exposed to summer heat waves; our understanding of detailed underlying mechanisms and the suitable therapeutic strategies have still not been worked out. One of the basic reasons behind this is the lack of a reliable experimental model to simulate clinical hyperthermia. This chapter describes a suitable animal model to induce hyperthermia in rats (or mice) comparable to the clinical situation. The model appears to be useful for studying the effects of heat-related illnesses on changes in various organs and systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). Since hyperthermia is often associated with profound brain dysfunction, additional methods to examine some crucial parameters of brain injury, e.g., blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and brain edema formation, are also described."
