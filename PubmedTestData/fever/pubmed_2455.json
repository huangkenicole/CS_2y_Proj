        "Shivering threshold and thermosensitivity were determined in six conscious rabbits at ambient temperature (Ta) 20 and 10 degrees C before and at six different times after saline injection (0.15 ml iv) and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced fever (5 micrograms/kg iv). Thermosensitivity was calculated by regression of metabolic heat production (M) and hypothalamic temperature (Thypo) during short periods (5-10 min) of square-wave cooling. Heat was extracted with a chronically implanted intravascular heat exchanger. Shivering threshold was calculated as the Thypo at which the thermosensitivity line crossed resting M as measured in afebrile animals at Ta 20 degrees C. There were negligible changes in shivering threshold and thermosensitivity in saline-injected rabbits. In the febrile animals, shivering threshold generally followed the shape of the biphasic fever response. At Ta 20 degrees C, shivering threshold was higher than regulated Thypo during the initial rising phase of fever and was lower during recovery. At Ta 10 degrees C the shivering thresholds were always higher than regulated Thypo except during recovery. Thermosensitivity was reduced by 30-41% during fever."
