        "We report the case of a 56-year-old male with multiple myeloma in whom recurrent fevers and leukocytosis delayed potentially effective chemotherapy due to concern for active infection.",
        "A thorough infectious workup, including CT and PET scans, was negative. The patient was eventually found to have an elevated serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) of 113 pg/ml (normal range 0.0 - 39.1 pg/ml), which was likely the cause of his persistent leukocytosis and fevers. Multiagent chemotherapy was initiated, and the fevers resolved in the next 4 days.",
        "Leukocyte concentrations trended down after initiation of chemotherapy, but it is uncertain how much of the decline was attributable to immunosuppression.",
        "We report this well-documented case to demonstrate that G-CSF production should be considered as a cause of unexplained fever and leukocytosis in patients with multiple myeloma to prevent inappropriate and delayed definitive diagnosis and treatment."
