        "The theory of reinforcement and reduction with acupuncture is one of the important contents of the needling techniques in acupuncture. In order to verify the theory, experimental fever caused by venous injection of E. Bacillus coll in rabbits were treated by acupuncture at Quchi(LI 11) with different needling methods (reinforcing or reducing) and stimulations (acupuncture or electroacupuncture). The results showed that each of the three reducing techniques with simple rotating of needle, rotation with lifting-thrusting needle and electroacupuncture presented the fever-subduing effects, especially obtaining the immediate effect and lowering the peak of fever. Among them, the former two had the better result than electroacupuncture. The reinforcing technique with rotating needle did not give rise to the significant effect on lowering fever. The result indicates that there exist significant differences in the effect on fever-subduing between reinforcing and reducing methods with acupuncture and between acupuncture and electroacupuncture. The simple reducing needling technique share the same therapeutic result with compound one. The work provides avaluable example for further laboratory study of reinforcing-reducing theory of acupuncture."
