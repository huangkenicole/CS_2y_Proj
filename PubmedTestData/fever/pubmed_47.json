        "A 21-question survey was conducted among parents attending 4 pediatric outpatient practices to assess their knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes about fever. One hundred and ninety-seven surveys were included. Most commonly the participating parent was the mother. Parents used mainly axillary thermometers to measure child's temperature and mentioned integers for their definition of fever, 100\u00b0F being the most frequent answer. Most parents would treat all fevers and would use alternating antipyretics. Parents had a generally negative perception of fever: only one third thought fever may have some benefit, and more than half thought there must be some risk. A positive perception of fever was associated with parental educational level but not with information by the pediatrician. There is much confusion about fever among our parents, a negative perception is prevalent, and parents seem to receive-or recall-little information from the pediatrician."
