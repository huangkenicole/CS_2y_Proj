        "Forty consecutive patients with an abnormal postoperative pyrexia were investigated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). All 80 lower limbs were examined by means of Parks 801 or 806 Doppler ultrasound apparatus. Doppler findings were confirmed by ascending peripheral venography or by the 125I-fibrinogen uptake method, or by both methods, in all cases. DVT was present in 9 limbs (11%). In 89% of the limbs DVT was excluded. An abnormal postoperative pyrexial response, as defined in this text, is thus a poor sign of DVT. It should, however, not be ignored, as it was indicative of venous thrombosis in 15% of the patients in this study. Confirmation of DVT should be obtained wherever possible by ascending peripheral venography, Doppler ultrasound, or some other available method. The use of anticoagulants should be restricted to those patients in whom the diagnosis has been confirmed."
