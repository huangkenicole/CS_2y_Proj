        "The presence of early postoperative fever after megaprosthesis replacement surgery is a concern for orthopedic oncologists due to the possibility of infection. The aims of the current study were to determine the incidences and patterns of fever and factors associated with its development and to determine the clinical significance of fever after megaprosthesis replacement surgery. Seventy-one patients who had undergone megaprosthesis reconstruction for previously unoperated localized lower-extremity osteosarcoma were reviewed. No patient had evidence of infection preoperatively. Mean patient age was 23.72\u00b116.84 years (range, 6.7-74 years), and average follow-up was 59.5 months (range, 4-240 months). Five postoperative surgical wound infections (4 deep, 1 superficial) occurred on postoperative days 5, 13, 14, 20, and 21. Fevers (body temperature of 38 \u00b0C or higher) were present in 62 patients (87.3%) at some point during the first 2 postoperative weeks. Peak body temperature was observed on postoperative day 1 in 62% of the febrile patients. Of the 62 febrile patients, 94% were relieved of fever by postoperative day 5. No significant association was observed between the presence of fever and surgical wound infection. Body temperature curves in patients with infection showed that several atypical patterns, such as multiple fever peaks and persistent fever, were accompanied by physical findings within the normalization period. Fever during the first 5 postoperative days is common after megaprosthesis replacement for bone sarcomas and seems to be a normal physiologic response to surgery. However, atypical fever patterns or additional physical findings require investigation."
