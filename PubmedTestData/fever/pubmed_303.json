        "This paper disproves the common belief that all doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that are commonly referred to as biphasic fever inducing (>/=2 microg/kg) cause truly biphasic responses. A catheter was implanted into the right jugular vein of several strains of adult male rats, and the animals were habituated to the experimental conditions. At an ambient temperature of 30.0 degrees C, loosely restrained animals were injected with a 10 microg/kg dose of LPS (various preparations), and their colonic (Tc) and tail skin temperatures were monitored (from >/=1 h before to >/=7 h after the injection). The results are presented as time graphs and phase-plane plots; in the latter case the rate of change of Tc is plotted against Tc. In experiment 1 the intravenous injection of LPS (from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, phenol extract) into the rats (Bkl:Wistar) induced a triphasic febrile response, as is obvious from time graphs of Tc (3 peaks), time graphs of effector activity (3 waves of tail skin vasoconstriction), and phase-plane plots (3 complete loops); the injection of saline (control) induced no Tc changes. We analyzed whether the triphasic pattern was due to some peculiarities of the experimental design, i.e., the pyrogen preparation used (experiment 2) or the rat strain tested (experiment 3) or whether this pattern reflects a more general law. In experiment 2 we used the same (phenol) preparation of different LPS (from Shigella flexneri 1A and Salmonella typhosa) and a different preparation (TCA extract) of the same LPS (E. coli). Regardless of the LPS used, rats of the Bkl:Wistar strain responded to the 10 microg/kg dose with the triphasic fever. In experiment 3, rats of other strains [Bkl:Sprague-Dawley and Sim:(LE)fBR(Black-hooded)] were tested. Again, all animals responded to the 10 microg/kg dose of E. coli LPS (phenol extract) with the triphasic fever. Because all fevers caused by four different LPS preparations in three rat strains were triphasic, the triphasic pattern is likely to constitute an intrinsic characteristic of the febrile response."
