        "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently recommends that antibiotic treatment should be considered for women with isolated maternal fevers during labor. However, there is little known about the maternal and neonatal impact of antibiotic treatment in this scenario.",
        "We sought to assess the outcomes in women with a nonsustained, isolated maternal fever treated with antibiotics and compare it with expectant management.",
        "This was a retrospective cohort study of laboring women with a singleton gestation at term and a single temperature of between 38.0\u00b0C and 38.9\u00b0C without other evidence of infection (leukocytosis >15,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, fetal tachycardia, malodorous amniotic fluid, suspected alternate source of infection) at a tertiary teaching hospital. A contemporaneously maintained, validated obstetrical database was used to identify women for our cohort. Women with rheumatologic or renal disease, nongestational diabetes, preterm labor, placental abruption, vaginal bleeding, HIV, malpresentation, and fetal anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was a postpartum fever above 38.0\u00b0C. Secondary maternal outcomes were treatment for postpartum endometritis, uterine atony, postpartum hemorrhage, admission to the intensive care unit, and postpartum length of stay. Secondary neonatal outcomes were neonatal intensive care unit admission, 5-minute Apgar score of <7, 5-minute Apgar score of <4, neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, and neonatal antibiotic administration. The results were compared using univariable and multivariable analyses.",
        "From January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, 359 women were identified; 85 received antibiotics and 274 did not. The baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, except for gestational age at the time of delivery (39.2 weeks vs 39.5 weeks for the antibiotic and no antibiotic groups, respectively; P=.02). The incidence in postpartum fever showed a downward trend in the antibiotic group (10.59% for the antibiotic group vs 18.98% for the no antibiotic group; P=.07). Significantly fewer women in the antibiotic group were treated for postpartum endometritis (3.53% vs 11.31%; P=.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admission and neonatal antibiotic administration rates were higher in the antibiotic group (41.18% vs 17.88%; P<.001 and 36.47% vs 12.41%; P<.001, respectively). The\u00a0incidence of 5-minute Apgar score of <7 was higher in the antibiotic group (8.25% vs 2.19%; P=.016). After controlling for age,\u00a0gestational age, body mass index, group B streptococci status, delivery method, parity, administration of epidural, and receipt of acetaminophen, the odds for postpartum fever were reduced by a factor of 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.99) among women who received antibiotics when compared with those who did not receive antibiotics. Outcome results are presented in Table 2.",
        "Although there was a lower rate of treatment for endometritis among women who received antibiotics for a single isolated maternal fever, there was a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit admissions and 5-minute Apgar score of <7. This indicates that there likely is maternal benefit associated with antibiotic use, however, there are concerns about the neonatal risk."
