        "Equine ingesta-associated choledocholithiasis is a rare cause of morbidity and mortality. We describe here the clinical, gross, histologic, and microbiologic features of this condition in 2 horses and compare the features to 2 previous cases. Case 1 was a 4-y-old Thoroughbred mare with colic. Case 2 was an 18-y-old American Paint Horse mare with colic, chronic weight loss, and inappropriate mentation. Both had elevated biochemical markers of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis and were euthanized given a poor prognosis. Case 1 had a well-formed 5-cm choledocholith surrounding a piece of hay, and had chronic neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis, bridging fibrosis, and extrahepatic obstruction. Case 2 had an ill-formed choledocholith with occasional hay fragments, wood stick, and twigs, and had regionally extensive hepatocellular necrosis with mild neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis and bridging fibrosis. <i>Enterococcus casseliflavus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were isolated in both cases; <i>Clostridium</i> spp. were also isolated from case 2. All 4 reported cases had increased activity of cholestatic enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, portal inflammation, and bridging fibrosis. Colic, pyrexia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and elevated hepatocellular enzyme activity were documented in 3 cases. Foreign material in all 4 cases was plant origin (choledochophytolithiasis), including hay (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20092), sticks/twigs (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20092), and grass awns (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20091). Ingesta-associated choledocholithiasis may be considered as a cause of colic, pyrexia, and elevated cholestatic biomarkers in horses."
