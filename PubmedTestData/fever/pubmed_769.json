        "In Abidjan, HIV prevalence has been estimated at 20% in outpatients attending community clinics. Documenting causes of fever in HIV-infected adult outpatients may help to improve care in these centres with limited facilities.",
        "Prospective study.",
        "We describe all diagnoses and treatments made during febrile episodes in HIV-infected adults participating in the ANRS 059 trial and followed up in a dedicated outpatient centre.",
        "Causes of fever could be identified in half of the 269 febrile episodes. Bacterial diseases were the leading identified cause of fever in all CD4 cell count strata (53, 56 and 43% of identified causes in episodes with CD4 count < 200 x 106/l, 200-499 x 106/l, and >or= 500 x 106/l, respectively), followed by malaria (5, 22, and 38%, respectively). Among febrile bacterial diseases, respiratory tract infections and enteritis accounted for 62% of organ involvement, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhi Salmonella represented 69% of isolated bacterial strains. In these bacterial episodes, an early empirical antibacterial treatment was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and fever. In the 19 episodes leading to death (7%), the two leading diagnoses were atypical mycobacteriosis (26%) and acute unexplained fever (21%). Death was associated with the absence of antimalarial treatment in the group of acute unexplained fevers.",
        "African HIV treatment guidelines should take into account the predominant role of bacterial infections and malaria in HIV-infected adult outpatients. Reports from other African settings would be useful to compare experiences in algorithms of empirical early antibacterial and antimalarial treatments."
