      "AbstractText": [
        "Body temperature is commonly used for assessing health and identifying infectious diseases in cats. Rectal thermometry, the most commonly used method, is stressful, invasive and time consuming. Non-contact infrared thermometry (NIRT) has been used with mixed success to measure temperature in humans and other species. The purpose of this study was to determine if NIRT measurements were comparable to rectal temperature measurements or, if not highly correlated, could at least identify cats in the hypothermic or hyperthermic range in need of further evaluation.",
        "From a total of six NIRT devices and 15 anatomic sites, three devices and three sites (pinna, gingiva and perineum) with the highest correlation to rectal temperature were selected for further study. Measurements were made in 188 adult cats housed indoors at animal shelters, veterinary clinics and private homes across a wide range of body temperatures and compared with rectal temperatures.",
        "Bland-Altman analysis revealed poor agreement between NIRT and rectal thermometry. The mean NIRT measurements ranged from 0.7-1.3\u00b0C below the mean rectal measurements, but the effect was not consistent; NIRT measurements tended to exceed rectal measurements in hypothermic cats and fall below rectal measurements in normothermic and hyperthermic cats.",
        "The accuracy of temperature measurements using NIRT devices is not reliable for clinical use in cats."
