        "Fever is one of the most common chief complaints that brings pediatric patients to seek medical care. Although fever is, in most cases, a physiologic response to a pathogen that has alerted the immune system, prolonged fever can be challenging to work up for the treating pediatrician. In addition to assessing causes of fever, pediatricians must also address the fears that many caregivers may have surrounding elevations in body temperature and provide education as to when fever becomes a concern. Fever can be classified by its duration as well as the presence or absence of associated symptoms. Fever without a source is defined as a fever that has been present for 1 week without a clear cause. Fever of unknown origin is a fever that has been present daily for 8 days or more without an apparent source. This article will walk through considerations for a clinician evaluating a pediatric patient with prolonged fever. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2023;52(4):e124-e126.]</b>."
