        "The purpose of this study was to investigate knowledge, principles, and practices concerning the management of children with febrile seizures among pediatricians in Greece. A cross-sectional study was performed across Greece. Pediatricians completed an anonymous and voluntary 11-item questionnaire about their knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to the management of febrile seizures; the survey also collected demographic data. It was first administered in paper form in October 2017. This was followed by an online survey performed between June and August of 2018 and publicized by medical boards across Greece. Descriptive statistics and comparisons between groups were conducted with the significance level set at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. We recorded 457 responses. Pediatricians admitted to modifying their advice to the parents of children with febrile seizures by suggesting more \"aggressive\" fever management at low temperatures or systematically (63%), referral to a specialist after any episode of febrile seizures (63%), or hospitalization in a subsequent episode (67%), even though 72% admitted these practices were of no efficacy. Almost one in three pediatricians (28%) believed aggressive management of fever could delay the onset of febrile seizures; increasing age was associated with this perception. A minority (28%) would make parents aware of febrile seizures before a first episode regardless of family history; 38% would do so in the event of family history.",
        "Several pediatricians in Greece use outdated and ineffective practices for the management of febrile seizures, despite the availability of updated evidence-based guidelines. Further training of practitioners is needed to bridge this gap.",
        "\u2022Aggressive management of fever\u00a0at low temperatures with antipyretics, referral to a neurologist, and hospitalization are not supported by evidence or recent guidelines on childhood febrile seizures. \u2022Febrile seizures are especially disturbing to uninformed parents, who may be inclined to pursue aggressive but ineffective treatments as a result.",
        "\u2022Pediatricians in Greece use non-evidence-based practices for the management of febrile seizures, even when they are aware that these practices are not effective. \u2022Older age increases the likelihood that a pediatrician will pursue guideline\u00a0non-compliant practices in Greece. At the same time, physicians with over 20 years of experience are more likely to inform parents in advance about febrile seizures."
