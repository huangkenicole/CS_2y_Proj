        "We reviewed clinical evaluation practices and documentation of fever (greater than or equal to 100.2 degrees F) in all febrile patients over a two-month period in a hospital-based nursing home (HBNH) compared with a community-based nursing home (CBNH). Results showed 38 febrile (mean 101.9 degrees F) HBNH patients and 26 febrile (mean 101.5 degrees F) CBNH patients. Median time from fever onset to physician contact was 4 hours in HBNH and 12.5 hours in CBNH episodes (P less than 0.01). Laboratory studies were initially performed in 68% of HBNH and 31% of CBNH episodes (P less than 0.005), and diagnosis of fever source was documented in 76% of HBNH and 16% of CBNH episodes (P less than 0.005). Overall assessment stratification showed 81% febrile HBNH patients had both evaluation and therapy performed compared with 38% in CBNH (P less than 0.0001); 39% of febrile CBNH patients had no evaluation or therapy performed. Results indicate lack of documentation, and fever evaluation in CBNHs may preclude complete detection of nursing home-acquired infections and thereby hamper preventive responses to potential infection problems."
