      "AbstractText": [
        "We investigated social and logistic factors eg, distance from the medical center, language barriers, other children to care for, number of caregivers, etc.) for families to delay seeking immediate emergency care for neutropenic fever in a retrospective cohort study of all pediatric hematology-oncology patients who presented for fever in the setting of neutropenia to our emergency department or clinic from 2015 to 2020. Patients with a history of at least 2 prior admissions for neutropenic fever waited more often for a second fever before presenting versus those without such history (odds ratio 5.00, 95% CI 1.26 to 19.84, P =0.04). No other significant associations were found."
