        "We have examined the influence of natural variations in endocrine status on the ability to generate a prostaglandin-induced fever in virgin female, pregnant and lactating rats and compared responses to those in male rats. Endocrine status of virgin female rats was assessed from examination of vaginal smears and time of parturition noted to enable accurate dating of pre- and postparturient fevers. Unanesthetized rats, previously prepared with intraventricular guide cannulas and intraperitoneal telemetry thermistors, were given intraventricular injections of prostaglandin E1 (2-100 ng/5 microliters) and temperatures monitored for 3 h after injection. Virgin females developed significantly larger fevers than did males at higher doses. There were no significant alterations in either fever height or duration as a function of the phase of the reproductive cycle in the females. Both pregnant and postparturient rats within the several days around birth displayed significantly lower fevers than did virgin females, but there was no further reduction in the immediate periparturient period. These data indicate that there are sex-, and possibly hormone-dependent differences in the central mechanisms involved in fever generation and antipyresis."
