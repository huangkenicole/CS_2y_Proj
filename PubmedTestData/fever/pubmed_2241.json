        "Hypertension is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease and is present in most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypertension is largely responsible for premature cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. The pathophysiology of hypertension in ESRD is complex, and multiple mechanisms are likely involved in blood pressure dysregulation in patients on hemodialysis. Some of these patients demonstrate resistant hypertension. Aggressive control of hypertension in ESRD/dialysis is mandatory. Generally, nonpharmacologic treatments are not enough to achieve the goal blood pressure levels in dialysis patients. Multiple antihypertensive drugs are often necessary. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system offer a number of advantages for patients with chronic kidney disease or ESRD, but additional drug classes are often needed to achieve effective blood pressure control in dialysis patients. Physicians treating hypertension in dialysis patients should be familiar with the pharmacokinetic properties of antihypertensive drugs in renal failure and choose the dosages accordingly. Vigorous control of hypertension is recommended to reduce the disease burden in patients with ESRD."
