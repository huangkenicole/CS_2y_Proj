        "Experiments were done on ten lambs ranging in age from 15 to 25 days to define the temperature, metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses to intravenous administration of a small dose of bacterial pyrogen (SAE). Administration of SAE but not normal saline produced a short-lived fever of about 0.7 degrees C. The increase in body-core temperature was preceded by a surge in total body oxygen consumption and the onset of shivering which was influenced by behavioral state (ie, shivering was inhibited during active sleep). The increase in total body oxygen consumption was initially met by an increase in total body oxygen extraction and then by an increase in systemic oxygen delivery. Systemic arterial blood pressure did not change significantly during the febrile response; however, pulmonic arterial blood pressure increased significantly. Thus, our experiments provide new data on oxygen supply and demand during the development of fever and that shivering thermogenesis is inhibited in active sleep following the administration of bacterial pyrogen in young lambs. The influence of active sleep on the overall febrile response, and whether or not there is a shift from shivering thermogenesis to non-shivering thermogenesis remains to be determined."
