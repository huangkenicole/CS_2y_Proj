        "Nurses often perceive fever in relation to the impact it has on specific patient populations. Fever in HIV/AIDS patients is a common symptom. This descriptive study explored how nurses in AIDS care defined and described fever in HIV/AIDS patients and used nursing interventions for fever management. Seventy-five registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and LPNs employed in AIDS care throughout Florida were surveyed concerning interventions for AIDS-related fever. The study revealed that nurses in AIDS care treat fever by providing patient comfort, initiating nursing interventions for low-grade to moderate fever, and notifying the primary care provider if nursing interventions do not keep the temperature below 100.9 degrees F. The sample provided a variety of nursing interventions to make the patient more comfortable. In addition, the study also revealed a unique perspective for fever care, which influences the practice of nurses in AIDS care and might differentiate nursing practice in AIDS care from other nursing specialties. However, some interventions differed from fever nursing management strategies published by the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care. Further research needs to explore the efficacy of these interventions."
