        "The febrile responses of homozygous (di/di) Brattleboro rats, to both intravenous endogenous pyrogen and to a lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, were compared with those of normal Sprague-Dawley rats. There were no detectable differences between the fever curves of the two strains in response to endogenous pyrogen. Brattleboro rats, which are deficient in the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP), displayed fevers that were both qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those of normal Sprague-Dawley rats that do not suffer from congenital diabetes insipidus. It is concluded that the absence of AVP-containing cells in Brattleboro rats is not an important factor in determining the nature of their febrile responses to endogenous pyrogen. More remarkable, however, were the divergent febrile responses of the two strains to intravenously injected endotoxin. Normal rats displayed hypothermic responses, whereas the Brattleboro rats became febrile. By 2 h after the injection of endotoxin, body temperatures in both strains had returned to normal. Three hours after the rats had been exposed to endotoxin, both strains were found to be totally refractory to endogenous pyrogen. However, when both strains of rats were tested to endogenous pyrogen 3 days later, their febrile responses were more than double the magnitude of their initial control responses. These alterations in the febrile responsiveness of rats occurring at different times after the injection of endotoxin appear to be related to the effects that endotoxin has on the cells of the reticuloendothelial system, over the same time course."
