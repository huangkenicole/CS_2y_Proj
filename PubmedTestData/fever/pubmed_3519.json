        "The importance of evidence-based practice has been emphasised in nursing in recent years. However, the process by which research evidence is turned into clinical recommendations is not always clear. This is important because understanding and communicating the rationale for clinical decisions is a vital part of the role of the children's nurse. This article discusses the methods by which nurses can turn evidence into practice using a framework devised by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) Working Group. The article uses the treatment of fever in children as an example of how nurses can apply the GRADE framework to ensure that their practice is evidence-based."
