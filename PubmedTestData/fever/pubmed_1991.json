      "AbstractText": [
        "The adrenal gland is one of the organs which tuberculosis infects. In most clinical settings bilateral adrenal tuberculosis has been clarified after adrenal insufficiency is overt. On the contrary, active adrenal tuberculosis is rarely detected during the survey of infectious disease. A 68-year-old man was admitted because of intermittent fever. The fever had continued for the last 3 months. The intermittent fever was accompanied with leukocytosis and elevation of C-reactive protein. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor was 1920 U/ml, and beta2-microglobulin was 4.0 mg/l. Bacterial cultures of blood, sputa, urine, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid did not show any particular bacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative in culture of sputa, and there was no tuberculin reaction. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were 18.5 pmol/l and 527.0 nmol/l, respectively. Abdominal CT scan showed right adrenal mass with a size of 28 x 20 mm, which was low density and had a well-encapsulated homogenous appearance. After the adrenalectomy, histology verified active adrenal tuberculosis. The intermittent fever disappeared, and white blood cells and C-reactive protein normalized. These findings indicate an atypical, rare case of unilateral, active adrenal tuberculosis closely linked to intermittent fever, and without any other organ involvement."
