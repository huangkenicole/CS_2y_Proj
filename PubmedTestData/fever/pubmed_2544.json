      "AbstractText": [
        "One hundred and forty five children aged 1 month to sixty months who had fever at presentation to the paediatric department of University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital were investigated for urinary tract infection in this prospective study from November 2004 to October 2005. Prevalence of urinary tract infection was found to be 13.7 per cent. While the female sex and malnutrition were found to be significantly associated with urinary tract infection, height of temperature and symptoms referable to urinary system were not. Ninety per cent of the isolates were Gram negative; mainly coliform Spp, the remaining 10 per cent were due to staphylococcus aureus. Gentamicin was still found to be effective against most of the urinary pathogens. However, clavulinic acid potentiated amoxicillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid and cotrimoxazole were found to be poorly effective. We therefore conclude that all ill children especially younger ones presenting with fever be screened for urinary tract infection. A regular surveillance of urinary tract infection pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern is recommended."
