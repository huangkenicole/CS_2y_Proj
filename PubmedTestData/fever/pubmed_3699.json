        "The fever was evoked in rabbits by single iv injection of pyrogen-standard from E. coli, and rifamycin SV was administered at the peak of the fever (T = 1.7 degrees C). The rifamycin blood level was determined during the fever stability and changes of kinetics of the antibiotic were investigated. It was found that distribution and elimination of rifamycin were decreased during fever. The consequence of the inhibition of the antibiotic elimination was the increase of its level in blood and tissue compartments."
