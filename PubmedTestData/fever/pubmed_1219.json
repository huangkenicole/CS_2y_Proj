        "Malawi malaria treatment guidelines recommend a definitive diagnosis, using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT), for all patients with fever or history of fever. Improving the management and outcomes of febrile children with negative mRDT results should be a priority.",
        "Through a prospective cohort study designed to investigate clinical outcomes of children treated at the community level, we followed, for 7 days, children aged 2 to 59 months, who had negative mRDT results and were treated with antipyretic medication. Clinical outcomes were assessed on days 3 and 7 post-recruitment.",
        "The median age of recruited children was 19 months. Of the 285 children enrolled, 139 (48.8%) were females. Of the children for whom data were available for analysis, 95/236 (40.3%) had fever (temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C) at enrolment, and almost half of the sick children (125/268; 46.6%) had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Most sick children (89.6%; 95% confidence interval, CI = 84.2 to 93.3) recovered, while 10.4% (95% CI: 6.7 to 15.8) were still sick by day 7 of follow-up. There were no deaths reported during the 7 days of follow-up. Being afebrile at enrolment (odds ratio, OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.0; P = 0.027) and sleeping under an insecticide-treated net (ITN) (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.2 to 6.2; P = 0.011) were associated with recovery by day 7. In multivariable analysis, sleeping under an ITN the previous night was the only factor associated with recovery by day 7. Microscopy did not detect any malaria parasites in the blood of recruited children, at recruitment or on day 7.",
        "In this community-level study, the majority of febrile children with negative mRDT results recovered within 7 days of health worker consultation for a febrile illness, having only taken antipyretics."
