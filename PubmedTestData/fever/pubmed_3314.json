        "Immediate treatment with cold water immersion (CWI) is the gold standard for exertional heatstroke. In the field, however, treatment is often delayed due to delayed paramedic response and/or inaccurate diagnosis. We examined the effect of treatment (reduction of rectal temperature to 37.5\u2009\u00b0C) delays of 5, 20, and 40\u2009min on core cooling rates in eight exertionally heat-stressed (40.0\u2009\u00b0C rectal temperature) individuals. We found that rectal temperature was elevated above baseline (P\u2009<\u20090.05) at the end of all delay periods (5\u2009min: 40.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32; 20\u2009min: 39.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40; 40\u2009min: 39.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u2009\u00b0C). Mean arterial pressure was reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.05) below baseline (92\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009mm\u2009Hg) after all delay periods (5\u2009min: 75\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6; 20\u2009min: 74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7; 40\u2009min: 70\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009mm\u2009Hg; P\u2009>\u20090.05). Rectal core cooling rates were similar among conditions (5\u2009min: 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01; 20\u2009min: 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02; 40\u2009min: 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u00b0C/min; P\u2009>\u20090.05). The rectal temperature afterdrop following CWI was similar across conditions (5\u2009min: 35.95; 20\u2009min: 35.61; 40\u2009min: 35.87\u2009\u00b0C; P\u2009>\u20090.05). We conclude that the effectiveness of 2\u2009\u00b0C CWI as a treatment for exertional heat stress remains high even when applied with a delay of 40\u2009min. Therefore, our results support that CWI is the most appropriate treatment for exertional heatstroke as it is capable of quickly reversing hyperthermia even when treatment is commenced with a significant delay."
