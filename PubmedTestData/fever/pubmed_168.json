      "AbstractText": [
        "Procalcitonin (PCT) is a current, frequently used marker for severe bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of PCT levels to differentiate bacteremic from nonbacteremic patients with fever. We assessed whether PCT level could be used to accurately rule out a diagnosis of bacteremia.",
        "Serum samples and blood culture were obtained from patients with fever between August 2008 and April 2009. PCT was analyzed using a VIDAS\u00ae B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay. We reviewed the final diagnosis and patient histories, including clinical presentation and antibiotic treatment.",
        "A total of 300 patients with fevers were enrolled in this study: 58 with bacteremia (positive blood culture) (group I); 137 with local infection (group II); 90 with other diseases (group III); and 15 with fevers of unknown origin (group IV). PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with bacteremia than in those with non-bacteremia (11.9 \u00b1 25.1 and 2.5 \u00b1 14.7 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 74.2% and 70.1%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 0.5 ng/mL. A serum PCT level of < 0.4 ng/mL accurately rules out diagnosis of bacteremia.",
        "In febrile patients, elevated PCT may help predict bacteremia; furthermore, low PCT levels were helpful for ruling out bacteremia as a diagnosis. Therefore, PCT assessment could help physicians limit the number of prescriptions for antibiotics."
