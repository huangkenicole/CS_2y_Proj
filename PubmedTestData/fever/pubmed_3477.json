        "Evidence on the community knowledge and perceptions on malaria are crucial to design appropriate health communication strategies for malaria control. Orissa, an Indian state with a large proportion of indigenous populations and hilly terrains contributes to the highest malaria burden in India. A study was undertaken to assess the knowledge on malaria among community members who had experienced fever and chills in the endemic district of Boudh in Orissa.",
        "A cross-sectional community-based survey was carried out with respondents (n=300) who had fever with chills within two weeks prior to data collection through a multi-stage sampling and interviewed them using a pre-tested, structured interview schedule.",
        "About 90% of respondents recognized fever as a common symptom of malaria, 72.3% said mosquito bites cause malaria, 70.3% of respondents reported mosquito control and personal protection to be the method of malaria prevention, and 24.6% identified chloroquine as the drug used for treatment. Women and scheduled tribe (ST) respondents were found to have lower level of appropriate knowledge of causes, symptoms, and prevention methods of malaria than their counterparts.",
        "The study population had a fair knowledge of malaria about the causes, symptoms, treatment, modes of prevention and outcomes of non-treatment compared to most of the studies conducted in similar settings. However, the relatively low awareness among women and tribal population calls for more context specific communication strategies. Such strategies should be based on information needs assessment of different population subgroups, especially of women and members of the ST community, using media that is accessible and clearly understood by different groups."
