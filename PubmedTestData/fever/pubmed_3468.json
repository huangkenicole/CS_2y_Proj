        "Treatment-related mortality due to infectious complications following potentially curable aggressive chemotherapy remains a major clinical problem. However, the diagnosis of neutropenic infections is difficult. Although it is common practice to institute empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics in neutropenic fever, liberal use of antibiotics may contribute to increasing resistance and superinfection such as systemic mycosis. Clinicians are searching for a highly specific and sensitive marker indicating early infection. Serum concentrations of several acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A), proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1, IFNgamma, IL-6, IL-8), soluble adhesion molecules (soluble E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and more recently procalcitonin have been investigated as to whether these may contribute to identifying infections as the cause of neutropenic fever. Unfortunately, at present, based on the small and inconsistent amount of data available from the literature one is tempted to conclude that the predictive values of all these parameters are too low to influence the clinically based initial treatment decisions in patients with neutropenic fever."
