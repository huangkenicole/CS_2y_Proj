        "Malaria remains a public health problem in Kenya despite sustained interventions deployed by the government. One of the major impediments to effective malaria control is a lack of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This study was conducted to assess clinical malaria incidence and treatment seeking profiles of febrile cases in western Kenya.",
        "Active case detection of malaria was carried out in three eco-epidemiologically distinct zones topologically characterized as lakeshore, hillside, and highland plateau in Kisumu County, western Kenya, from March 2020 to March 2021. Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) conducted biweekly visits to residents in their households to interview and examine for febrile illness. A febrile case was defined as an individual having fever (axillary temperature\u2009\u2265\u200937.5\u00a0\u00b0C) during examination or complaints of fever and other nonspecific malaria related symptoms 1-2\u00a0days before examination. Prior to the biweekly malaria testing by the CHVs, the participants' treatment seeking methods were based on their behaviors in response to febrile illness. In suspected malaria cases, finger-prick blood samples were taken and tested for malaria parasites with ultra-sensitive Alere<sup>\u00ae</sup> malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for quality control examination.",
        "Of the total 5838 residents interviewed, 2205 residents had high temperature or reported febrile illness in the previous two days before the visit. Clinical malaria incidence (cases/1000people/month) was highest in the lakeshore zone (24.3), followed by the hillside (18.7) and the highland plateau zone (10.3). Clinical malaria incidence showed significant difference across gender (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20097.57; df\u2009=\u20092, p\u2009=\u20090.0227) and age group (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200958.34; df\u2009=\u20094, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Treatment seeking patterns of malaria febrile cases showed significant difference with doing nothing (48.7%) and purchasing antimalarials from drug shops (38.1%) being the most common health-seeking pattern among the 2205 febrile residents (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200921.875; df\u2009=\u20094, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Caregivers of 802 school-aged children aged 5-14\u00a0years with fever primarily sought treatment from drug shops (28.9%) and public hospitals (14.0%), with significant lower proportions of children receiving treatment from traditional medication (2.9%) and private hospital (4.4%) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was no significant difference in care givers' treatment seeking patterns for feverish children under the age of five (p\u2009=\u20090.086). Residents with clinical malaria cases in the lakeshore and hillside zones sought treatment primarily from public hospitals (61.9%, 60/97) traditional medication (51.1%, 23/45) respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). However, there was no significant difference in the treatment seeking patterns of highland plateau residents with clinical malaria (p\u2009=\u20090.431).The main factors associated with the decision to seek treatment were the travel distance to the health facility, the severity of the disease, confidence in the treatment, and affordability.",
        "Clinical malaria incidence remains highest in the Lakeshore (24.3cases/1000\u00a0people/month) despite high LLINs coverage (90%). The travel distance to the health facility, severity of disease and affordability were mainly associated with 80% of residents either self-medicating or doing nothing to alleviate their illness. The findings of this study suggest that the Ministry of Health should strengthen community case management of malaria by providing supportive supervision of community health volunteers to advocate for community awareness, early diagnosis, and treatment of malaria."
