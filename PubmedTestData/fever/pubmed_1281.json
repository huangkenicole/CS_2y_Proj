        "The fever is one of the commonest symptoms of disease in childhood. A mother's knowledge and conception of fever may determine the degree of her anxiety and fear, and reflect on the way the fever is managed at home. Our understanding of mothers' attitudes may help to improve the home management of fever by correcting unrealistic beliefs. Mothers of 100 children were randomly selected and interviewed to answer a questionnaire about fever. Sixty mothers thought that fever could lead to death, others thought that it might lead to paralysis, mental retardation or brain damage. This may explain their undue anxiety and fear when having a child with fever. Cold exposure, teething, exposure to sunlight and having a warm drink were considered as causes. A minority reduced the child's clothes during fever. Tap water sprinkling and occasionally alcohol were used. Ninety-four mothers used antipyretics, all used paracetamol and 23 per cent used aspirin. Sixty two used antibiotics indiscriminately. Improved health education is required to allay mothers fear and anxiety and promote a more appropriate fever management at home."
