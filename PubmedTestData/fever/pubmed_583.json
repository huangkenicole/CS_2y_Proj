        "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with diverse manifestations, and its pathogenesis is unclear and complicated. Infection and SLE are similar in that they both cause inf lammatory reactions in the immune system; however, one functions to protect the body, whereas the other is activated to damage the body. Infection is known as one of the common trigger factors for SLE; there are a number of reports on infectious agents that provoke autoimmune response. Several viruses, bacteria, and protozoa were revealed to cause immune dysfunction by molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and bystander activation. In contrast, certain pathogens were revealed to protect from immune dysregulation. Infection can be threatening to patients with SLE who have a compromised immune system, and it is regarded as one of the common causes of mortality in SLE. A clinical distinction between infection and lupus f lare up is required when patients with SLE present fevers. With a close-up assessment of symptoms and physical examination, C-reactive protein and disease activity markers play a major role in differentiating the different disease conditions. Vaccination is necessary because protection against infection is important in patients with SLE."
