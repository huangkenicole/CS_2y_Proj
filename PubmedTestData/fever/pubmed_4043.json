        "Antipyretics, in particular acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen, constitute the single most important class of drugs used therapeutically for an effect on body temperature. Hallucinogens exert prominent actions on the central nervous system, and it is not surprising that, like so many other centrally-acting agents, they too often affect temperature. This compilation primarily covers the considerable amount of data published from 1981 through 1985 on the interactions of these drugs and thermoregulation, but data from many earlier papers not included in a previous compilation are also tabulated. The effects of agents not classically considered as antipyretics on temperatures of febrile subjects are also covered. The information listed includes the species used, the route of administration and dose of drug, the environmental temperature at which experiments were performed, the number of tests, the direction and magnitude of change in body temperature and remarks on special conditions, such as age or brain lesions. Also indicated is the influence of other drugs, such as antagonists, on the response to the primary agent."
