        "To understand the febrile children in clinic practice, 3793 cases had been collected from our emergency unit from December 1984 to December 1985. Of them, 2841 (74.9%) were febrile with a male to female ratio of 3:2. Concerning age distribution, 22% were younger than 6 months, 21.5% between 7 months and 1 year, 17.6% 1-2 years and 38.9% older than 2 years. Cases happened most in February, followed by July. In these febrile children, the axillary temperature was 37.1-37.9 C in 778 cases (27.4%), 38-38.9 C in 1118 cases (39.3%), 39-39.9 C in 846 cases (29.8%), 40-40.9 C in 91 cases (3.2%), and 41-41.9 C in 8 cases (0.3). Convulsion associated with fever were noted in 112 cases (3.9%). Of them, axillary temperature was 37.1-37.9 C in 30 cases (3.9%), 38-38.9 C in 29 cases (2.6%), 39-39.9 C in 42 cases (4.9%), 40-40.9 C in 6 cases (6.6%), and 41-41.9 C in 5 cases (62.5%). Clinical diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (1125 cases, 39.6%), acute bronchitis (515, 18.1%), acute bronchiolitis (232, 8.2%), acute gastroenteritis (235, 8.3%), bronchopneumonia (159, 5.6%), acute tonsillitis (135, 4.7%), sepsis (88, 3.1%), and others (352, 12.4%). In conclusion, most emergency called children had fever. The underlying disease to induce fever is most frequently the respiratory tract infection. The possibility of convulsion increase with the rising of body temperature."
