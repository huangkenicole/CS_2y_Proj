      "AbstractText": [
        "Acute upper respiratory infections (AURI) are widespread in adolescents. Infections are associated with inflammation which in turn is responsible for symptoms and fever occurrence. Ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) has a potent anti-inflammatory activity associated with effective analgesic and antipyretic effects and has a valuable safety profile. In this regard, KLS could be advantageous in adolescents with AURI.",
        "A group of primary-care pediatricians retrospectively collected data from adolescents with AURI treated with KLS for three days. Fever and symptom perception were assessed by a visual analog scale and were monitored daily for five days. Adolescents (or parents) sent their data to doctors using a phone application (WhatsApp; Meta Platforms, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA).",
        "This retrospective analysis included sixty-one adolescents (mean age 13.4 years, females and males). KLS treatment markedly and quickly reduced fever and symptoms severity. In addition, the treatment was very well tolerated by all adolescents.",
        "Adolescents present peculiar psychological characteristics that may determine some difficulties in prompt management of AURI treatment, while an adolescent with a respiratory infection requires a prompt and adequate cure. KLS, thanks to its pharmacologic profile, could be favorably used in this context. In addition, the treatment was safe, and the acceptability was high."
