        "To make a systematic analysis on literatures concerning traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) advices in Treatise on Febrile Diseases, and summarize the main connotations of traditional Chinese medicine advices, relevant TCM advices in Treatise on Febrile Diseases were collected, screened, compared, summarized and analyzed according to TCM dosage form preparation methods, TCM administration methods, medication contraindications and nursing after TCM administration. The literatures concerning medications in Treatise on Febrile Diseases were consulted, summarized and compared to standardize medicine advices and facilitate rational clinical application of TCMs. The standard medicine advices were as follows. The boiling water for TCMs shall be tap water and well water. The decoctions that have effects in promoting blood and meridians can be boiled with wine. The decoctions containing toxic components can be boiled with honey. Some TCMs shall be boiled with special methods, e. g. Herba Ephedra that could be boiled before other medicine and skimmed. Japonica rice could be added in decoctions to measure the duration of decoctions. Different dosages were required for different forms (litre, pill, medicine spoon). Administration times, temperature and frequency shall be adjusted according to target positions, functions and stage of illness. As for dietary contraindications during medication, thick porridges are recommended, where foods impacting medicine efficacy are prohibited. Regarding nursing after medication is important to recover physical functions, particularly warm porridges can go with diaphoretic recipes, while thick porridges can go with purgative recipes. And drug efficacies shall be defined by observing urine and excrements, and blood form. In conclusion, Treatise on Febrile Diseases is the first book that discusses TCM advices and records them in details. In this study, new standard medicine advices were proposed to provide important basis for improving clinical advices of TCMs and supports for developing the TCM dispensing technology."
