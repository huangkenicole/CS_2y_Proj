        "To analyze the working conditions and evaluate the effectiveness of blood smear examinations in fever patients after the start of national malaria elimination program (NMEP), and explore the suitable strategy for malaria diagnosis and surveillance in NMEP, so as to provide the evidence for the development and adaptation of malaria elimination strategies and measures in Jiangsu Province.",
        "The data of malaria epidemic situation reported by network, fever patients' blood test tables, and epidemiological surveys of malaria cases were collected and statistically analyzed by SPSS 16.0 in Jiangsu Province from 2010 to 2016.",
        "A total of 2 367 cases of malaria cases were reported from 2010 to 2016. Among the 3 691 188 person-times of fever patients tested, there were 2 252 positives (0.06%). The number of blood tests of fever patients decreased from 742 900 in 2010 to 277 000 in 2016. At the same time, the positive rate increased from 0.04% in 2010 to 0.16% in 2016. The positive rate of blood tests of fever patients in 2016 was significantly higher than that in 2010 (<i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> = 161.61, <i>P</i> < 0.01). From 2010 to 2016 in Jiangsu province, the centers for disease control and prevention of cities and counties, that completed the blood review within 3 days, deleted 273 negative cases. In 2010, the centers for disease control and prevention of cities and counties deleted 61 negative cases, but in 2016, the centers deleted only 14 negative cases, and the negative rate of blood review in 2010 was significantly higher than that in 2016 (<i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> = 22.99, <i>P</i> < 0.01).",
        "A large number of blood smear examinations have been tested in fever patients in Jiangsu Province. It not only conforms to the strong monitoring system requirements issued by World Health Organization (WHO) in malaria elimination, but also provides the evidence for no local malaria case in Jiangsu since 2012."
