        "The febrile response to both intravenous and intracerebral administration of pyrogens was investigated in young and old male New Zealand White rabbits. Intravenous bacterial pyrogen evoked biphasic fevers in both groups of animals. However, the fevers in the group of older rabbits were significantly less than in younger animals. In contrast, intravenous injection of endogenous pyrogen produced identical fevers in the two groups. Bacterial and endogenous pyrogens injected into a lateral cerebral ventricle evoked marked febrile responses of long duration in both young and old rabbits. The responses of the old rabbits were significantly less than those of the younger ones. Finally, direct microinjection of prostaglandin E1 into tissue sites within the anterior hypothalamic preoptic area elicited short latency hyperthermic responses which were significantly less in the older rabbits. Analysis of ear skin temperatures during fever demonstrated that some of the differences may, in part, be due to altered vasoconstrictor responses in the peripheral vasculature. Thus, these data indicate that the febrile response is altered with increasing age in the rabbit."
