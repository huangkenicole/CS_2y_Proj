        "Fever represents the major surrogate of infection in neutropenic cancer patients. A number of neutropenic fever syndromes have been recognized, the causes and significance of which will vary depending upon the clinical context. First neutropenic fever syndromes are typically of bacterial origin, the character of which may be influenced by whether antibacterial chemoprophylaxis has been administered. Persistent neutropenic fevers are documented during the empirical systemic antibacterial therapy for the first neutropenic fever, the cause of which is likely outside the spectrum of activity of the initial therapy. Recrudescent neutropenic fevers, defined by the appearance of a new fever after defervescence of the first fever, are often a function of invasive fungal infection or gram-positive infections outside the spectrum of the initial empirical antibacterial regimen. The myeloid reconstitution syndrome occurs in parallel with neutrophil recovery from aplasia and may not necessarily represent new infection. Recognition of these patterns can help the clinician make better clinical judgments and management plans."
