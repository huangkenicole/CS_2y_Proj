        "Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is, as the name implies, characterized by an extremely regular cycle of fevers that is accompanied by one or more other symptoms such as oral ulcers, pharyngitis, adenitis, tonsillitis, sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and headache. Originally known as Marshall syndrome, PFAPA is most commonly identified in children younger than age 5 years; however, adults may also present with the disease, though they may report additional symptoms. PFAPA is now understood to be a diagnosis of exclusion. Laboratory studies are typically unremarkable except for increases in acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein. Treatment is primarily supportive and most frequently uses systemic steroids to suppress the inflammatory response. Acute flares are self-limited, and the syndrome typically resolves on its own as the child reaches age 7 or 8 years."
