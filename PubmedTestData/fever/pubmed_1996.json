        "To study the mechanism of action of physical antipyresis, core temperature was measured in two groups of rats in which heat loss was increased by cold exposure and by cooling an inferior cava heat exchanger, respectively, both before and after infection with Salmonella enteritidis. Cold exposure did not influence core temperature. On the other hand, cooling the heat exchanger caused a fall in core temperature of approximately 0.7 degree C, to 37 degrees C in normothermia and to 38.5 degrees C 24 h after the infection. These lower core temperatures were then regulated against any further increase in heat loss until the thermoregulatory metabolic capacity of the animals was exhausted and a hypothermia developed. It is concluded that in infectious fever the threshold temperature of shivering increases as much as core temperature. Furthermore it is suggested that physical antipyresis, such as sponging with tepid water, induces a moderate but regulated fall in temperature to about the threshold of shivering and that its efficacy may increase with ambient temperature."
