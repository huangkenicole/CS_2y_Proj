        "The management of the febrile infant is truly a complex and evolving topic in pediatrics. The clinical practice guideline provides a map for physician decision making in this important clinical issue. An individual physician may alter the course of action based on his or her treatment threshold but must recognize the limitations of that approach. Documentation of management decisions that deviate from published guidelines are important for patient care. The medical record must carefully represent the appearance of the patient, the actions taken, and the discussion with the family regarding management. Close follow-up includes phone contact with documentation and reexamination of the patient in a reasonable period of time. All who deal with the common problem of fever in infants should follow this subject closely and be ready to adopt new management strategies when evidence from outcomes-based research emerges. In the mean time, the current practice guideline offers an excellent starting point in the management of this common and vexing clinical problem."
