      "AbstractText": [
        "The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR), initiated in 1993, is a collaborative project between the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Cancer Centres and specialists from French Public Universities, General Hospitals and Private Clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcomes for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary experts group, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery.",
        "To develop a clinical practice guideline for the management of neutropenic cancer patients (excluding prolonged neutropenia).",
        "Data have been identified by literature search using Medline and Current Contents (up to February 1997) and personal reference lists. The main end points considered were mortality, morbidity, risk factors, fever, source of infection, microbiological documentation, incidence and length of hospital stays, quality of life, efficacy of treatment, safety and costs. Once the guideline was defined, the document was submitted to 48 reviewers for peer review and to the medical committees of the 20 French Cancer Centres for review and agreement.",
        "The key recommendations are: 1) before receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients must be informed of potential risks and precautions to observe; 2) non-febrile neutropenic patients can be followed at home (except specific context); antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended; 3) initial empirical antibiotic therapy for febrile patients is mandatory, whether associated beta-lactam and aminoglycoside, or monotherapy with a broad-spectrum beta-lactam (except in case of septic shock or pneumopathy). A glycopeptide can be added in case of overt catheter-related or cutaneous infection, in case of microbiologically documented infection with a oxacillin-resistant Gram positive bacteria, or in case of persistent fever in a clinically deteriorating patient; 4) at the present time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the management of febrile neutropenic patients at home. We recommend participation in studies to identify predicting factors of low-risk patients and to assess the feasibility and safety of early discharge and home therapy."
