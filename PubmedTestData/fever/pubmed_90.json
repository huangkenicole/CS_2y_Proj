        "The purpose of this study was to compare the febrile responses of Fischer 344 rats of different ages [young (3-5 mo), mature (12-15 mo), and aged (24-27 mo; n = 8)] to two psychological stress paradigms, cage switch and exposure to an open field, as well as to injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-6 were also measured in the plasma of these rats at 90 min postinjection with LPS. There was no significant difference among groups in febrile responses to switching their cages. Exposure to an open field for 30 min resulted in a smaller rise in temperature in the aged rats (0.62 degree C) than in the young rats (1.26 degrees C). This difference disappeared if rats were exposed to an open field for 60 min. Injection of LPS led to fevers that developed at a slower rate in aged rats than in the mature groups. The peak fevers, however, were not different. The activity of interleukin-6 90 min after injection of LPS was higher in aged rats (297,858 U/ml) than in young (17,462 U/ml) and mature rats (28,819 U/ml). TNF levels were also higher in aged rats (16,380 U/ml) compared with young (574 U/ml) and mature rats (36 U/ml). We conclude that although the magnitude of the febrile response is not different among rats of different ages, the rise in body temperature occurs slower in aged rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
