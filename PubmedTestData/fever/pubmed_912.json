        "Drug fever refers to a febrile response to a drug, and its clinical picture often resembles an allergic reaction or infection. The fever most commonly occurs 7-10 days after drug administration, persists as long as the drug is continued, and disappears soon after stopping the drug (Tabor, 1986). The risks and benefits of continuing a drug that causes fever must be evaluated for every patient who experiences drug fevers. Quality-of-life issues arise for patients who experience them despite the concurrent use of steroids. Recognizing drug fever is of great clinical importance. If drug fever is not recognized, patients may be subjected to prolonged hospitalizations and unnecessary testing and medications (Johnson & Cunha, 1996). Oncology nurses play an important role in the early recognition of drug fever."
