        "Fever, as a significant event, has not been studied systematically in patients with acute pancreatitis. We studied prospectively incidence, etiology, and impact of fever on the management and outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis.",
        "All consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis were studied for the development of fever, its etiology, and its influence on the management and outcome of acute pancreatitis. Fever was considered to be significant, if the temperature was >38 degrees C and persisted for >2 days.",
        "A total of 75 patients (51 males; mean age 41 years) with acute pancreatitis were included between January 1997 and June 1998. The causes of pancreatitis were gallstones in 48%, alcohol in 28%, and others in 24% of the patients. 20 patients had pancreatic necrosis, and 45 (60%) developed fever during the course of pancreatitis. The etiology of fever was infected pancreatic necrosis in 8 (18%), pancreatitis per se in 10 (22%), cholangitis in 4 (9%), nonpancreatic infections in 17 (38%), and an undetermined one in 6 (13%) patients. Of the 45 patients with fever, 17 had pancreatic necrosis as compared with only 3 of 30 patients who did not develop fever (p < 0.05). Patients with fever had a higher pancreatitis-related mortality than those without fever (p = 0.03).",
        "60% of the patients with acute pancreatitis developed fever. Infected pancreatic necrosis was the cause of fever in 18% of the patients and not in the majority, i.e., 82% of the patients. The mortality rate was higher in patients who developed fever than in those who did not."
