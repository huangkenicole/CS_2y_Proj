        "The use of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens is becoming more widely recognized in the palliation of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Anecdotal reports of chest pain, rigors and fevers in the hours that follow radiotherapy led us to perform a survey estimating the frequency and severity of these symptoms following treatment to the thorax. One hundred and eighteen patients completed questionnaires 24 hours after palliative radiotherapy treatment; 84 were male. The median age was 67 years. One hundred and seven had histologically confirmed NSCLC. A parallel opposed technique was used in 113 patients. Doses ranged from 8 Gy in a single fraction to 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Chest pain was reported by 54 (45.8%) patients after the first radiotherapy fraction; in 42 it commenced within 12 hours of treatment. The pain varied in site, nature and duration; on 23 occasions, it lasted under 2 hours. Systemic symptoms (rigors, sweating, fevers) were documented on 43 questionnaires, starting within 12 hours of treatment in 33 patients and on 30 occasions lasting less than 2 hours. Chest pain and systemic symptoms occurred together in 28 patients. Only 49 (41.5%) patients reported no immediate side effects. We conclude that patients receiving palliative radiotherapy for bronchial carcinoma often develop significant symptoms in the hours following treatment. The timing and duration suggest a relationship with the radiotherapy, and we feel that patients should be warned of the possible occurrence of these symptoms."
