        "Pediatric cancer patients with fever are at risk for invasive bacterial infection. The administration of antibiotics to these patients within the first hour of evaluation is viewed as a quality of care metric with potential to improve outcome. We sought to evaluate the impact of prearrival patient orders on the timeliness of antibiotic administration for this patient population presenting to the emergency department (ED) because of fever.",
        "A single-site pediatric ED intervention study was performed. Four hundred thirty-nine consecutively referred febrile immunocompromised pediatric oncology patients were included in the study. The intervention used structured monthly messages sent to oncology and emergency medicine providers highlighting specific roles in prehospital communication and in ED-based care emphasizing the use of standardized, prearrival order (PAO) sets. Primary outcome measures were time to antibiotic administration (TTA) and the proportions of patients receiving PAO placement and antibiotics within 60 minutes of ED arrival. Results were analyzed for the preintervention (September 2016-July 2017), intervention (August 2017-February 2018), and postintervention (March-December 2018) periods.",
        "Improvements occurred across the study periods in the proportion of patients with PAO placement (preintervention, 68%; intervention, 82%; postintervention, 87%; P = 0.001) as well as in the percentages of patients receiving antibiotics in less than 60 minutes (preintervention, 73%; intervention, 84%; postintervention, 85%; P = 0.02). Median TTA decreased from 48 to 40 minutes ( P = 0.018). Linear regression with TTA as a dependent variable revealed that PAO placement predicted a shorter TTA, decreasing by more than 15 minutes ( B = -15.90; [95% confidence interval, -20.03--11.78]; P < 0.001).",
        "Standardizing elements of prehospital communication and ED-based care using PAO sets resulted in significant improvements in time to antibiotics and in the proportion of febrile immunocompromised oncology patients receiving antibiotics within 60 minutes of ED arrival."
