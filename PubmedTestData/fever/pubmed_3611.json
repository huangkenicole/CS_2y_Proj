        "Traditionally febrile neutropenic patients have been treated with parenteral antibiotics in an inpatient setting; however, recent work by several investigators has demonstrated successful treatment with both parenteral and oral antibiotics in an ambulatory environment. This has been accomplished by identification of low-risk neutropenic patients, advances in broad-spectrum antibiotics with long half-lives and stabilities, the introduction of the oral quinolones, home health-care initiatives, improvements in vascular access devices, and development of technically enhanced antibiotic delivery systems. Outpatient antibiotic therapy for febrile episodes in low-risk neutropenic patients should now be considered an acceptable alternative to hospital-based treatment. This review focuses on the development and rationale of risk stratification and examines the results of various outpatient antibiotic trials recently completed."
