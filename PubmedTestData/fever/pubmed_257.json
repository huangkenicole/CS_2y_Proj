        "Neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) occurs in 0.5-0.8/1000 live births and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Its presenting signs in newborns are non-specific, so risk assessment before birth is essential. Maternal fever during labor is the strongest predictor of EOS, but the current standard is for infrequent manual determinations of temperature. We aimed to determine whether continuous measurement of temperature during labor is feasible, accurate, and more effective than manual measurements for detecting fever. Women were recruited on admission in labor at >\u200935 weeks gestational age, with <\u20096\u00a0cm cervical dilation. Sensors were affixed in the axilla, which transmitted every 4 minutes by Bluetooth to a dedicated tablet. Conventional temperature measurements were taken every 3-6 hours per routine. Of 336 subjects recruited, 155 had both >\u20094 hours of continuous data and >\u20092 manual temperature measurements and were included for analysis. Continuous recordings were feasible and correlated well with manual measurements independent of mean temperature. Of 15 episodes of fever\u2009>\u200938\u00a0\u00b0C detected by both methods, 13 were detected earlier by continuous (9 of those more than 1 hour earlier). Manual measurements missed 32 fevers\u2009>\u200938\u00a0\u00b0C and 13 fevers\u2009>\u200938.5\u00a0\u00b0C that were identified by continuous. Continuous measurement of maternal temperature for the duration of labor is practical and accurate. It may be more sensitive for identifying infants at risk for EOS than the current practice, enabling earlier and more effective targeted treatment of affected infants."
