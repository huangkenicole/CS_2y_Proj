        "To provide an approach to recurrent fever in childhood, explain when infections, malignancies, and immunodeficiencies can be excluded, and describe the features of periodic fever and other autoinflammatory syndromes.",
        "PubMed was searched for relevant articles regarding the pathogenesis, clinical findings, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of periodic fever and autoinflammatory syndromes.",
        "Fever is a common sign of illness in children and is most frequently due to infection. However, when acute and chronic infections have been excluded and when the fever pattern becomes recurrent or periodic, the expanding spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, including periodic fever syndromes, should be considered. Familial Mediterranean fever is the most common inherited monogenic autoinflammatory syndrome, and early recognition and treatment can prevent its life-threatening complication, systemic amyloidosis. Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome is the most common periodic fever syndrome in childhood; however, its underlying genetic basis remains unknown.",
        "Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases are increasingly recognized in children and adults, especially as causes of recurrent fevers. Individually they are rare, but a thorough history and physical examination can lead to their early recognition, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment."
