        "Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by constitutional symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, and multi-organ dysfunction due to excessive cytokines, notably Interleukin-6. Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease is often sub-classified into iMCD-TAFRO, which is associated with thrombocytopenia (T), anasarca (A), fever/elevated C-reactive protein (F), renal dysfunction (R), and organomegaly (O), and iMCD not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS), which is typically associated with thrombocytosis and hypergammaglobulinemia. The diagnosis of iMCD is challenging as consensus clinico-pathological diagnostic criteria were only recently established and include several non-specific lymph node histopathological features. Identification of further clinico-pathological features commonly found in iMCD could contribute to more accurate and timely diagnoses. We set out to characterize bone marrow (BM) histopathological features in iMCD, assess differences between iMCD-TAFRO and iMCD-NOS, and determine if these findings are specific to iMCD. Examination of BM specimens from 24 iMCD patients revealed a high proportion with hypercellularity, megakaryocytic atypia, reticulin fibrosis, and plasmacytosis across patients with both iMCD-NOS and iMCD-TAFRO with significantly more megakaryocytic hyperplasia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in the iMCD-TAFRO cases. These findings were also consistent with BM findings from 185 published cases of iMCD-NOS and iMCD-TAFRO. However, these findings are relatively nonspecific as they can be seen in various other infectious, malignant, and autoimmune diseases."
