        "Fever is a common feature in various pathological conditions that manifests a series of molecular events in the internal milieu. Much less attention has been paid to the clinical importance and the management of fever in breast cancer patients. However, several studies have reported an association between postoperative fever and poor treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients. The fever is a side effect of chemotherapy and a manifestation of cancer recurrence. The postmenopausal breast cancer patients experience another body temperature disturbance that is known as a hot flashes. Here, we reviewed the literature regarding postoperative fever and the possible underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Then the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was discussed as a therapeutic option to control postoperative fever. Finally, we reviewed the chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever and cancer vaccination-induced fever."
