        "Myoclonus associated with fever or following an infectious event (parainfectious myoclonic jerks) is a transient event with an abrupt onset. It is not common and often not recognized. In these reports, its clinical features and its favorable outcome are described.",
        "We identified three pediatric patients with parainfectious myoclonic jerks who were treated at Children's Neuropsychiatry Unit at the University-Hospital of Parma (Italy).",
        "The myoclonic jerks presented an abrupt onset and were characterized by brief involuntary muscle contractions temporally related to febrile episodes or following infectious illnesses. The outcome was positive as they resolve spontaneously with cessation of febrile/infective events.",
        "Parainfectious myoclonic jerks are temporary benign phenomena that could occur in association with the fever or following an infectious event. It is quite important to make a correct diagnosis as early as possible to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations or investigations."
