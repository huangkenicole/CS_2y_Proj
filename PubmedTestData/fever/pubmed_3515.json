        "An ehrlichia was consistently isolated from the peripheral blood leukocyte fraction of ponies that had been experimentally infected with Potomac horse fever by whole blood transfusion from naturally infected horses. The organism was propagated in a human histiocyte cell line for 3 to 5 weeks and then inoculated intravenously or intradermally into healthy adult ponies. Clinical signs of Potomac horse fever, which varied in the degree of severity, occurred 9 to 14 days post-inoculation in all of the ponies. One pony died 20 days post-inoculation. The ehrlichial organism was reisolated in the human histiocyte cell line from the blood leukocyte fraction of all of the experimental ponies on each day that samples were examined (days 9, 10, 11, 19, and 39). These organisms were identical to those originally detected in the wall of the intestine of ponies with clinically diagnosed Potomac horse fever when compared by light and electron microscopy and an immunofluorescence labeling technique. The immunofluorescent antibody titer became positive in a pony at 20 days postinjection. These results indicate that the ehrlichial organisms is the causative agent of Potomac horse fever."
