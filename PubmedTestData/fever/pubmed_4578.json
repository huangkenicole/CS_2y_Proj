        "100 urban parents were interviewed concerning their knowledge, attitude, and treatment practices of fever in children. Only 55% of the parents were aware of the normal body temperature and 23% were aware of what constitutes febrile temperatures. A total of 58% considered fever a disease, 91% felt that it could continue to rise if unchecked, and 60% believed that if it is brought down, the child would be cured. For home treatment, paracetamol was used by 57% of the parents and cold sponging by 29%. 63% were of the opinion that a doctor must be consulted in the event of a fever. The understanding of fever and home treatment practices were significantly greater in parents who were highly educated. The above points must be considered when counseling the parent of a child with a fever, and for formulating a health education package for parents."

        "One hundred urban parents were interviewed for their knowledge, attitude and treatment practices towards fever in children. Only 55% parents were aware of the normal body temperature and 23% of the febrile temperature. A total of 58% considered fever as a disease, 91% felt that fever could go on rising if unchecked, and 60% believed that if it is brought down the child would be cured. As home treatment, paracetamol was used by 57% parents, and cold sponging by 29%. Sixty three per cent were of the opinion that a doctor must be consulted for any fever. The understanding of fever and home treatment practices were significantly better in highly educated parents. Above points must be considered while counselling parent of a febrile child, and for formulating health education package for the parents."
