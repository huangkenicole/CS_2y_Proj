        "Fever in infants under 90\u2009days of age is highly likely to be caused by a severe bacterial infection (SBI) and it accounts for a large number of patients visiting the pediatric emergency room. In order to predict the bacterial infection and reduce unnecessary treatment, the classic classification system is based on white blood cell (WBC) count, urinalysis, and x-ray, and it is modified and applied at each center by incorporating recently studied biomarkers such as c-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (PCT). This study analyzed the usefulness of PCT in predicting SBI when applied along with the existing classification system, including CRP, among infants less than 90\u2009days old who visited with a fever at a single institution pediatric emergency center.",
        "We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients younger than 3\u2009months of age who presented with fever at the Seoul Asan Medical Center pediatric emergency room between July 2017 and October 2018.",
        "A total of 317 patients were analyzed, and 61 were diagnosed with SBI, among which urinary tract infection (UTI) accounted for the largest proportion (55/61, 90.2%). There were differences in WBC, neutrophil proportion, CRP, and PCT between the SBI group and the non-SBI group, and the AUC values of WBC, CRP, and PCT were 0.651, 0.804, and 0.746, respectively. When using the cut-off values of CRP and PCTs as 2.0\u2009mg/dL and 0.3\u2009ng/mL, respectively, the sensitivity and specificity for SBI were 49.2/89.5, and 54.1/87.5, respectively. WBC, CRP, and PCT were statistically significant for predicting SBI in multivariate analysis (odds ratios 1.066, 1.377, and 1.291, respectively). When the subjects were classified using the existing classification criteria, WBC and CRP, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 29.3 and 88.7%, respectively, and when PCT was added, the PPV and NPV were 30.7 and 92%, respectively, both increased.",
        "PCT is useful for predicting SBI in children aged 3\u2009months or less who visit the emergency room with a fever. It is useful as a single biomarker, and when used in conjunction with classic biomarkers, its diagnostic accuracy is further increased."
