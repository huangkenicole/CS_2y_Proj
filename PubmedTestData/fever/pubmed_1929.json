        "To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of Airening Suppository (ARN) on carcinoma fever.",
        "Adopting randomized and double-blinded method, 54 patients with carcinoma fever were randomly assigned to the observation group and the control group, who were treated respectively with ARN and indomethacin suppository by anal administering, 7 days as one treatment course. The effect on body temperature on patients and side effect occurred were observed 7 days after discontinuation of the medication, and patients' serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta were determined by RIA, routine test of blood, urine and stool, liver and renal function were tested as well. Body temperature, changes of clinical symptoms, and adverse reaction were observed.",
        "The effective rate of fever abating was 86.7% in the observation group and 66.7% in the control group, showing significant difference between them (chi2 = 8.06, P <0.05). After treatment, serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the observation group were much lower than those in the control group (t = 7.477, t = 3.492, P <0.01). Besides, patients' chief clinical symptoms and quality of life were markedly improved in the observation group (t =4.71, P <0.05, chi2 =7.38, P <0.05), all better than those in the control group (P < 0.05). No evident effect on peripheral blood figure, or harmful impact on heart, liver and kidney function was found.",
        "Airening Suppository has a standing and stable fever abating effect in treating cancerous fever with no obvious adverse reaction, so it is worthy of clinical use and spreading."
