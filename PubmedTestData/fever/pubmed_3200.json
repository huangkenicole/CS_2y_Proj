        "Newborn babies are very vulnerable in their first weeks of life. Timely and appropriate management of neonatal conditions is paramount for health and developmental outcomes.",
        "The aim of this article is to provide an overview of common neonatal presentations to general practice, and highlight significant conditions that may require referral to the emergency department and/or other specialist.",
        "Clinical history and examination are the most important tools in neonatal assessment. Babies often present with non-specific symptoms, but a thorough clinical assessment can identify the &lsquo;unwell baby&rsquo; who requires immediate transfer to hospital. This includes babies with sepsis, moderate\u2011to\u2011severe dehydration or who are in acute cardiorespiratory compromise. A comprehensive neonatal assessment will also help to differentiate babies with significant conditions that may warrant further specialist input from those with normal neonatal development where parental support and reassurance may be sufficient."
