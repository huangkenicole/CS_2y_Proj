        "To examine whether the outcomes of fever treatment through home care differ from those through hospitalized care for older people who regularly receive home care in Japan.",
        "A retrospective survey of medical record-based data for 679 older people who regularly received home care provided by a clinic in Japan. From these data, 61 fever cases (21 cases treated in the hospital and 40 treated at home and assigned to the hospitalized and home-care groups, respectively) were selected for analysis through a matching process. We compared the two groups in terms of mortality rate at 90\u2009days after fever onset, and concerning changes in respective ranks for \"Degree of Independent Living for the Elderly with Disability\" and \"Degree of Independent Living for the Elderly with Dementia\" from immediately before fever onset to 90\u2009days after fever onset.",
        "The mortality rate tended to be higher in the hospitalized group than in the home-care group (33% vs. 13%, respectively, P = 0.05). The hospitalized group also had a higher proportion of patients whose disability had worsened (43% vs. 23%, respectively, P = 0.16) and a significantly higher proportion of patients whose dementia had worsened (29% vs. 6%, respectively, P = 0.03).",
        "Our findings suggest that home care is more effective than hospitalized care for treating fever in older people who regularly receive home care in Japan, as it leads to lower mortality and better maintenance of activities of daily living capabilities.
