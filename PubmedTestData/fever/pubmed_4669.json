        "In the tropics, febrile illnesses are often presumed to be due to malaria, because of its endemicity, and treatment can lead to delay in diagnosis or failure to detect severe infections such as bacteraemia. This study sought to determine the prevalence of bacteraemia and malaria parasitaemia in febrile post-neonatal infants (age 1-12 months) at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, and the bacterial aetiological agents of bacteraemia in the infants. Therefore, 102 infants aged 1-12 months who presented with fever with a negative history of antimicrobial use in the week prior to presentation were evaluated and had blood cultures done for the detection of aerobic organisms by standard methods and blood films for malaria parasites. Bacteraemia was found in 38.2% of the infants, malaria parasitaemia was found in 46.1%. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (35.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (33.3%) and Klebsiella spp. (10.3%). Febrile children should be investigated for the presence of bacterial infection even if the blood film for malaria parasites is positive. Where laboratory facilities are not available, consideration should be given to the use of both anti-malarial therapy and empiric antibiotic therapy in the management of febrile infants, depending on the clinician's judgement."
