        "The impact of inflammation in utero on amniotic fluid composition, the delivery term and the number of newborn rats per litter was investigated. The growth of newborns during the first fourteen days of life was analysed.",
        "Changes in the metabolome were evaluated using (1)H NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis. NMR spectra were segmented and principal component analysis was performed. Three groups were compared: a control group that received saline solution, a hyperthermic group (HYP) and a group that received injections of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (350 \u03bcg/kg/day).",
        "The most discriminating metabolites in the three profiles were identified, highlighting different metabolic pathways for providing glucose and energy to the foetus. The LPS group was characterized by glycolysis under anaerobic conditions, while the HYP group was characterized by a gluconeogenic amino acid pathway. These metabolic changes in amniotic fluid were accompanied by changes in the gestation outcome, the main differences concerning the mean number of pups per litter (control 9.74 \u00b1 0.6, HYP 6.81 \u00b1 0. and LPS 4.85 \u00b1 1.11) and the biometric growth of the pups.",
        "Some consistent metabolic changes, observable by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, occurred in amniotic fluid during prenatal stress caused by hyperthermia and LPS-induced inflammation and had an impact on the gestation outcome."
