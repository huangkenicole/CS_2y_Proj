        "To investigate the status and influential factors associated with 2-week prevalence of fever and diarrhea among infants and young children at the age of 6-23 months in poor rural areas.\u2029 Methods: A total of 8 735 rural infants and young children aged 6-23 months in 30 poor counties of Wuling Mountains and Luoxiao Mountains in Hunan Province were selected in August 2015, and the questionnaires were used to collect information on the prevalence of fever and diarrhea, person and families, and feeding status. The data for prevalence of fever and diarrhea in infants and young children were calculated, and multi-non-conditional logistic regression model were used to analyze the influential factors.\u2029 Results: The 2-week prevalence of fever and diarrhea in infants and young children was 20.8% and 12.2% respectively. The ages (OR=0.66, 95%CI 0.58 to 0.75), Dong ethnicity(OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.17 to 1.74) and low body weight (OR=1.31, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.54) were influential factors for fever among infants and young children in poor rural areas; female (OR=0.86, 95%CI 0.76 to 0.98), 12-17 months (OR=0.80, 95%CI 0.69 to 0.93), 18-23 months (OR=0.51, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.60), other ethnic minorities (OR=1.70, 95%CI 1.13 to 2.56), non-complementary feeding (OR=1.65, 95%CI 1.05 to 2.59) and low body weight (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.14 to 1.70) were the influential factors of diarrhea among infants and young children.\u2029 Conclusion: The 2-week prevalence of fever and diarrhea among infants and young children aged 6-23 months in poor rural areas were quite serious. Low age, Dong ethnicity, and low birth weight are high risk factors for fever. Male, no addition of complementary feeding, and low birth weight are high risk factors for diarrhea."
