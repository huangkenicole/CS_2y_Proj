        "In conscious unrestrained rats, at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C, oesophageal temperature was measured and temperature effect of single and repeated intravenous injection of E. coli endotoxin was examined. The first injection of endotoxin in a dose of 10.0 mug/rat did not change the rat body temperature. The second injection of this dose in the same animals repeated after 48 h produced fever. With following injections the fevers observed were less pronounced. The absence of fever after a single injection of endotoxin was accompanied by the rapid loss of pyretic activity of the rat plasma samples (bioassayed in rabbits). When fever was observed (48 h interval between endotoxin injections) the pyretic activity of the rat plasma remained unchanged for 90 min following endotoxin injection. It was concluded that after a single injection endotoxin is rapidly detoxified in the rat circulation while this process does not take place after the second endotoxin injection (48 h interval). The process of endotoxin detoxification can be depressed by the pretreatment with nitrogen mustard. Analysis of changes of skin temperature following endotoxin injections and the influence of aspirin on endotoxin-induced fever suggest that the fever observed was of central origin."
