        "Periodic fever syndromes are a group of disorders sharing similar symptoms, characterized primarily by regularly recurring fevers. PFAPA syndrome, one of the members of this group of disorders, is a clinical entity of unknown etiology which is frequently seen in the early childhood. Currently, the pathogenesis and the genetic basis of most of the disorders in the periodic fever spectrum are known, other than that of PFAPA syndrome. Although, classically PFAPA syndrome is known as a sporadic disease, we propose that it is not sporadic. We think that PFAPA syndrome may be an inherited disease and this hypothesis is supported by the clinical mimicry of PFAPA syndrome with other periodic fever syndromes with well-known genetic transmissions, frequent occurrence of the condition in members of the same family and emergence of common genetic mutations in the periodic fever syndrome spectrum. Moreover, our clinical observation that most of the patients diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome were of the same families strongly suggest a probable genetic transmission of this disorder. We have decided to discuss this hypothesis to contribute to the literature and assist our colleagues who are dealing with this commonly overlooked and often misdiagnosed disorder."
