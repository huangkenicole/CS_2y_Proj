        "Rhabdomyolysis represents a life-threatening condition, which results in release of cellular contents (myoglobin, enzymes, and electrolytes) into the plasma. We report a pediatric patient with mild rhabdomyolysis who had a favorable outcome. A 3-year-old girl had been ill for 2 days with high fever, anorexia, pain in both thighs, and passage of dark-red urine. Myoglobinuria was demonstrated by a \"blood\"-positive dipstick in the absence of red blood cells in the urinary sediment. Diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a high serum creatine kinase activity. The child was treated on an outpatient basis and has shown full clinical and biochemical recovery. There has been no recurrence of myoglobinuria during the 2-year follow-up."
