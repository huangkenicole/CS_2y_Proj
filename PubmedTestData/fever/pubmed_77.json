        "A clinical approach to the diagnosis of fever in childhood is presented. Fever can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, drug reaction, collagen disease, neoplasm, central nervous disorder, blood diseases, or physiological changes. Short-term fever is usually a viral infection but may be a bacterial infection. Careful history and physical examination play the major role in making the diagnosis, followed by appropriate studies: throat culture , urinalysis, blood counts, x-rays, blood cultures, and specific tests. The latter are indicated for the diagnosis of prolonged fevers, which also are usually caused by common disorders. A high sedimentation rate is more likely to be associated with a serious disorder and warrants immediate investigation. Treatment is symptomatic; one should reserve specific treatment and/or antibiotics for specific illness."
