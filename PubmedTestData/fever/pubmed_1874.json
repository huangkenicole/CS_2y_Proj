        "Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) plays important roles in protection against harmful effects of cold temperature. We previously found that several splicing variants of CIRBP mRNA are constitutively expressed in the heart of non-hibernating euthermic hamsters and that one of the variants is predominantly expressed with remarkable reduction in the expression of other variants in hibernating hypothermic hamsters. The aim of this study was to determine whether the regulation of alternative splicing is a common function in a non-hibernator, the mouse. The expression of CIRBP mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. In euthermic control mice, several splicing variants of CIRBP mRNA were detected in various organs. When hypothermia was induced in mice by using isoflurane anesthesia, the short form variant, which encodes full-length functional CIRBP, was predominantly detected. Keeping body temperature of anesthetized mice at 37\u00b0C prevented changes in the splicing pattern. Exposure of mice to a low temperature did not change the splicing pattern, suggesting that endogenous neuronal and/or humoral pathways activated in response to cold stimuli applied to the body surface play minor roles. In agreement with this, the shift in alternative splicing was reproduced in isolated leukocytes in vitro when they were incubated at 28\u00b0C. Since application of a TRPM8 or TRPA1 agonist at 37\u00b0C failed to promote the shift in the splicing pattern, it seems likely that cold-sensitive channels are not involved in the splicing regulation. Therefore, it is probable that a substantial reduction of temperature is a major cause of the regulation of alternative splicing of CIRBP transcripts. The regulatory system of CIRBP expression at the level of alternative splicing, which was originally discovered in the hibernating hamster, commonly exists in non-hibernators such as mice."
