        "In Africa, fever is the main reason for consultation, with malaria playing a prominent role. Studies have reported that the widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, implemented since 2010, has revealed an increasing proportion of non-malaria acute febrile illnesses (NMAFI). It is an important public health issue because evidence shows that mortality is higher among patients presenting with non-malarial fever than among those with malaria.",
        "This cross-sectional study assessed the professional practices of healthcare providers in the management of NMAFI in urban and rural sites in Burkina Faso. Data was collected from 286 healthcare providers through a questionnaire based on the clinical situation in 2014. Factors have been associated using a hierarchical linear mixed model with random intercepts to model dependence of outcomes for healthcare providers working on the same site.",
        "Survey results showed limited knowledge about management of NMAFI, global survey score on General Practice Indicator being 60% (36.02/60.00). This gap was more evident at the admission and diagnosis level. The study's population from rural areas had better survey score than that of urban areas concerning the respect of adequacy diagnosis, treatment and use of antibiotics in NMAFI, 15.71 vs 13.93 mean score (p=0.01) (75 vs 66% on a 0 to 100% scale, with 100% being the best). Overall, more educated participants performed relatively better. A total of 46% (134/286) of participants felt that they needed training in at least one of the fever-related issues.",
        "Increased awareness and knowledge of management for NMAFI are urgently required in Burkina Faso. This must be done through regular supervision and training courses targeted specifically at primary healthcare providers."
