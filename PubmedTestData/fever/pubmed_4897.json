        "We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study of outpatient therapy with ceftriaxone as a single agent in 50 episodes of fever and neutropenia in children treated with various myelosuppressive regimens for different malignancies. All patients underwent clinical and radiological evaluation and blood/urine cultures taken before starting therapy. Patients with dehydration, hypotension, rigor and clinical exit-site infection of indwelling right-sided catheters were excluded. Forty-one patients completed an antibiotic course of 7 days: in 12 patients fever returned to normal on day 2, in 10 patients on day 3, and in 8 patients on day 4. The duration of neutropenia following the initial febrile episode was 3-10 days. In some patients fever returned to normal after 2 days, but neutropenia persisted up to 10 days. Two patients were bacteremic--Escherichia coli in one, and Acinetobacter/Staphylococcus coagulase negative in another; all isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone. In nine episodes, antimicrobial therapy was modified because of persistent fever > 39 degrees C in five patients, bacteremia in two, enterocolitis in one, breakthrough fever in two, and bronchopneumonia in one. The low incidence of bacterial isolation is probably attributed to the selection of patients with low risk features. Patients and parents complied with and favored outpatient therapy to hospitalization."
