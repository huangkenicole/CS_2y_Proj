      "AbstractText": [
        "There is limited information on uptake of malaria testing among migrants who are a 'high-risk' population for malaria. This was an explanatory mixed-methods study. The quantitative component (a cross sectional analytical study-nation-wide migrant malaria survey in 2016) assessed the knowledge; health-seeking; and testing within 24\u00a0h of fever and its associated factors. The qualitative component (descriptive design) explored the perspectives of migrants and health care providers [including village health volunteers (VHV)] into the barriers and suggested solutions to increase testing within 24\u00a0h. Quantitative data analysis was weighted for the three-stage sampling design of the survey. Qualitative data analysis involved manual descriptive thematic analysis.",
        "A total of 3230 households were included in the survey. The mean knowledge score (maximum score 11) for malaria was 5.2 (0.95 CI 5.1, 5.3). The source of information about malaria was 80% from public health facility staff and 21% from VHV. Among 11 193 household members, 964 (8.6%) had fever in last 3\u00a0months. Health-seeking was appropriate for fever in 76% (0.95 CI 73, 79); however, only 7% (0.95 CI 5, 9) first visited a VHV while 19% (0.95 CI 16, 22) had self-medication. Of 964, 220 (23%, 0.95 CI 20, 26) underwent malaria blood testing within 24\u00a0h. Stable migrants, high knowledge score and appropriate health-seeking were associated with testing within 24\u00a0h. Qualitative findings showed that low testing within 24\u00a0h despite appropriate health-seeking was due to lack of awareness among migrants regarding diagnosis services offered by VHV, delayed health-seeking at public health facilities and not all cases of fever being tested by VHV and health staff. Providing appropriate behaviour change communication for migrants related to malaria, provider's acceptance for malaria testing for all fever cases and mobile peer volunteer under supervision were suggested to overcome above barriers.",
        "Providers were not testing all migrant patients with fever for malaria. Low uptake within 24\u00a0h was also due to poor utilization of services offered by VHV. The programme should seriously consider addressing these barriers and implementing the recommendations if Myanmar is to eliminate malaria by 2030."
