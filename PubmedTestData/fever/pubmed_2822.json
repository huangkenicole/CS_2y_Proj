        "The purpose of the present investigation was to detect the changes of hepatocyte ultrastructure in mammals (rat, Rattus norvegicus) and fish (crucian, Carassius auratus gibelio) after their exposure to hyperthermia. It was found that the common reaction to hyperthermia in both animal species studied was the mosaicism of the damage of hepatocytes and their organelles, changes in lipid utilization, chromatin condensation and the activation of the programmed death of cells. The differences in hepatocyte response to hyperthermia were: more moderate activation of protein synthesis in fish as compared to rat, a depression of detoxication functions and an increase in the amount of glycogen in the cell cytoplasm. In rats, lysosomal activation and the increase in the amount of lipids in hepatocytes were observed, together with the depletion of glycogen. In fishes, nucleolar changes were detected that reflected the low level of hepatocyte metabolism and corresponded to the development of a \"metabolic depression\" during the experiment. Thus, in fishes, the dominance of anabolic processes of metabolism was demonstrated, while in the rats the catabolic processes prevailed."
