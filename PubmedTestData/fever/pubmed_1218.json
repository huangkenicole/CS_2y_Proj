        "Laboratory biomarkers that can differentiate non-infectious fever from infectious fever after pancreas transplantation have yet to be discovered. Non-infectious fever was defined as the presence of fever (>38.3\u00b0C) in the absence of a documented clinical diagnosis of infection or a positive culture. Among 184 consecutive recipients, a total of 91 recipients developed fever within 1-month post-transplant, of whom 46 had infectious fever and 45 had non-infectious fever at our center between August 2014 and July 2019. The onset of fever was earlier in the non-infectious fever group (14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 post-transplant days) compared with the infectious fever group (16.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8 post-transplant days; p\u00a0=\u00a0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that serum procalcitonin at the peak of fever could significantly differentiate infectious fever from non-infectious fever (OR 53.378, 95% CI: 6.819-417.802, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The area under the curve for differentiating between the two groups was 0.853 (95% CI, 0.780-0.926) for procalcitonin and 0.667 (95% CI, 0.549-0.785) for CRP. The best cutoff values of serum procalcitonin and CRP were 0.405\u00a0ng/ml (sensitivity, 77.1%; specificity, 80.8%) and 7.355\u00a0mg/dl (sensitivity, 66.7%; specificity, 67.3%), respectively. Serum procalcitonin may be useful for differentiating non-infectious fever from infectious fever after pancreas transplantation."
