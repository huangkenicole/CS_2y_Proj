        "This study was carried out retrospectively to evaluate the pattern of diseases associated with fever among infants aged 1-6 months at Gunung Wenang General Hospital Manado. During the period of January 1988-December 1989, 189 infants with age ranging 1-6 months, were evaluated. Diseases associated with fever predominantly occurred in infants of 3 months old (73.0%). The final clinical diagnosis of diseases associated with fever were gastroenteritis (39.15%), pneumonia (28.05%), meningitis (9%), respiratory tract infection (15.4%), post vaccination (4.20%) and septicemia (4.3%). The fever ranged from 37.8-38.3 degrees C (38%), 38.4-39.5 degrees C (49%), 39.6-41 degrees C (10%) and more than 41 degrees C (3%). The elevated body temperature was significantly related to the duration of fever (p 0.01). Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and thrombocytopenia were not correlated significantly (p greater than 0.05) with elevated body temperature while the total white cell count had a significant relationship (p less than 0.05)."
