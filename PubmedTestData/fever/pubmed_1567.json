        "Thermosensitivity (TS) and threshold core temperature for metabolic cold defence were determined in six conscious rabbits before, and at seven different times after i.v. injection of killed Staphylococcus aureus (8 x 10(7) or 2 x 10(7) cell walls x kg(-1)) by exposure to short periods (5-10 min) of body cooling. Heat was extracted with a chronically implanted intravascular heat exchanger. TS was calculated by regression of metabolic heat production (M) and core temperature, as indicated by hypothalamic temperature. Threshold for cold defence (shivering threshold) was calculated as the core temperature at which the thermosensitivity line crossed preinjection resting M. The shivering thresholds followed the shape of the fever response. TS was significantly reduced (up to 49%) during the time course of fever induced by the highest dose of pyrogen only. At both high and low doses of pyrogen TS correlated negatively with shivering threshold (r = 0.66 and 0.79 respectively) with similar slopes. The reduction in TS during fever was thus associated with the increase in shivering threshold resulting from the pyrogen injection and not by the dose of pyrogen. Model considerations indicate, however, that changes in sensitivity of the thermosensory input to the hypothalamic controller may affect threshold changes but cause negligible TS changes. It is more likely that the reduction in TS is effected in the specific hypothalamic effector pathways."
