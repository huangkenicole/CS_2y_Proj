        "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as an emerging infection disease results in high morbidity and mortality in China. In this study, the circulating levels of 36 inflammatory mediators in 33 SFTS patients on days 3-7, 8-12 and 13-20 post-illness were measured by a multiplex Luminex\u00ae system dynamically. Among the patients, 15 severe patients recovered, 11 severe patients died within three weeks. We found IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-15, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, G-CSF, eotaxin, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and fractalkine were significantly upregulated in SFTS patients. Elevated IL-15 and eotaxin in SFTS patients were reported firstly. The highest levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines coexisted in fatal patients during the first week. Inflammatory mediators remained high levels when death occurred in fatal patients, they were recovered within three weeks in nonfatal patients. Our results showed the occurrence of inflammatory storm in SFTS patients were associated with the severity of SFTS. RANTES and PDGF were down regulated and remained significantly lower levels in fatal patients throughout the course of disease, the concentrations of RANTES and PDGF were remarkably positively correlated with the platelet count. Our results demonstrated that dysregulated inflammatory response was associated with disease pathogenesis and mortality in SFTS patients."
