        "Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas, which can result in serious morbidity or death. Acute pancreatitis severity can be reduced in experimental models by preconditioning animals with a short hyperthermia prior to disease induction. Heat shock proteins 27 and 70 are key effectors of this protective effect. In this study, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis using a combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and isobaric tagging to investigate changes in pancreatic proteins expression that were associated with thermal stress, both in healthy rats and in a model of caerulein-induced pancreatitis. In agreement with previous studies, we observed modulation of heat shock and inflammatory proteins expression in response to heat stress or pancreatitis induction. We also identified numerous other proteins, whose pancreatic level changed following pancreatitis induction, when acute pancreatitis severity was reduced by prior thermal stress, or in healthy rats in response to hyperthermia. Interestingly, we showed that the expression of various proteins associated with the secretory pathway was modified in the different experimental models, suggesting that modulation of this process is involved in the protective effect against pancreatic tissue damage."
