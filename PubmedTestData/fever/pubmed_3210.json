        "To identify causes of fever, treatable diseases, and the most helpful investigations in febrile children, who had travelled to the tropics or subtropics in the preceding year.",
        "Prospective observational study of all admissions to children's wards in a district general hospital in Birmingham between January 1997 and July 1999. Children with fever >37.5 degrees C and a history of travel to the tropics or subtropics in the preceding 12 months were included. Data were available on 153/162 children; median age was 5 years (range 0.1-15). A total of 133 (85%) children had visited South Asia; only 18/135 had received malarial prophylaxis. Median time to presentation after travel was four weeks. Children were investigated with full blood count, blood film, and stool culture. Other investigations were performed at the discretion of the admitting paediatrician.",
        "Diarrhoeal illness (n = 41) and malaria (n = 22) were the most common diagnoses. A treatable cause for the febrile illness was identified in 70 (46%) children. One or more investigations were positive in 60% of children. Stool culture (17% positive) and blood film (14% positive) were the most helpful investigations. Platelet counts greater than 190 x 10(9)/l had a negative predictive value of 97% for malaria in this population.",
        "Children who present with fever and have travelled to the tropics or subtropics in the preceding year, often have a treatable infection. They should have a full blood count, blood film for malarial parasites, stool culture, blood culture, and chest x ray."
