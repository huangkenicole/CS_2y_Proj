        "Fever is an important symptom in children. In infants younger than 2 months of age, fever might be the only indicator of bacterial disease. Critical to the well-being of these infants is that the physician understand the importance of the occurrence of fever within the first 2 months of life and appropriately investigate the causes of fever. Although all infants with fever require comprehensive evaluation for bacterial disease, not all require hospitalization or empiric treatment with antibiotics. Febrile infants 1 to 2 months of age who, after comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluation, are found to have no other findings that place them in a higher-risk category for bacterial disease are candidates for continuing observation as outpatients. This management option should be restricted to selected infants whose caretakers and primary physicians agree with and are able to carry out such a plan."
