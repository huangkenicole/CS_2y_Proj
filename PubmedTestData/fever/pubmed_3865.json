        "Episodes of acute illness associated with fever are common in children. Less common but also diagnostically challenging are episodes of prolonged fever in children. This article reports recent literature that has focused on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, and treatment of both types of episodes.",
        "A number of articles reviewed the epidemiology in several countries of bacteremia in children, including bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. Host susceptibility factors for bacterial illness, such as malnutrition, were reported. Diagnostic issues concerning bacteremia, including the technique of venipuncture and urine antigen testing, were of interest. A major study was published that reported a preventive approach through immunization to one type of bacteremia that caused by S. pneumoniae. Other studies addressed the issues of choice of therapy and duration of therapy in selected bacteremic disease, such as dental bacteremias and bacteremia, that were caused by Brucella melitensis. Lastly, several causes of prolonged fever (such as hemophagocytic syndrome and atypical cat scratch disease) were reported.",
        "During the review period, studies addressed diverse issues related to acute and prolonged episodes of fever in children. There was a particular emphasis on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of bacteremic illness in children."
