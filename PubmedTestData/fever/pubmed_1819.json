        "A principal side effect of biological response modifiers (BRMs) is a constellation of constitutional symptoms often referred to as a \"flu-like syndrome\" (FLS). Precisely what this syndrome encompasses is frequently unclear, but its major components appear to be fever, chills, rigors, myalgias, and headache. Other components variously included are anorexia, nausea, upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion and cough, and the ill-defined symptom, malaise. The manner in which the \"flu-like\" syndrome manifests itself during treatment with interferon (IFN), interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), and colony stimulating factors (CSFs) will be described with attention to frequency, duration and severity. The common mechanisms underlying the appearance of a flu-like syndrome during biotherapy will be elucidated with emphasis on the role of endogenous pyrogens and prostaglandins and on the physiology of the process. Methods to prevent or alleviate these uncomfortable side effects, including medical interventions such as alterations in schedule/route/dose of BRM administration and premedication with a variety of agents, as well as nursing measures such as patient education will be discussed."
