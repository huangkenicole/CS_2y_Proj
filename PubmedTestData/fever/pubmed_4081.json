        "Interventional crossover study.",
        "Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts afferent input to the hypothalamus and impairs efferent vaso- and sudomotor output, especially in lesions above the sympathetic chain (T1-L2). In consequence, persons with SCI under heat stress experience impairment in the ability to dissipate heat proportional to the lesion level. Thermoregulatory dysfunction places an individual at high risk of hyperthermia, which can be life threatening, especially for athletes with SCI during exercise. Current evidence on therapeutic cooling techniques in athletes with SCI is limited, but basic physiologic and research data suggest water spray (WS) might be efficacious, particularly in athletes with tetraplegia (TP), who are most impaired in thermoregulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of WS on core temperature (Tc) during exercise in athletes with SCI.",
        "Texas, USA.",
        "Eleven individuals with SCI: seven with TP, four with paraplegia (PP); and sixteen able-bodied (AB) controls underwent a wheelchair intermittent sprint exercise for 90\u2009min under two conditions: (1) WS application every 15\u2009min and (2) control (C), without WS. Tc was measured every 15\u2009min and was analyzed for the effect of group (TP, PP, and AB) and time. Change in Tc (\u0394Tc) was also compared between groups.",
        "\u0394Tc was significantly higher in TP vs. PP (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and TP vs. AB (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) groups under C treatment. WS significantly attenuated \u0394Tc in TP (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001), but did not change \u0394Tc in PP or AB.",
