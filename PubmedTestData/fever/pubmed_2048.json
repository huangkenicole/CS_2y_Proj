        "The first step in diagnosing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is to suspect its presence and then order the appropriate diagnostic tests. The development of screening procedures for HLH could facilitate early diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated the utility of fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias as screening criteria for identifying pediatric HLH at an early stage, built a screening model using commonly measured laboratory parameters, and developed a step-wise screening procedure for pediatric HLH.",
        "The medical records of 83,965 pediatric inpatients, including 160 patients with HLH, were collected retrospectively. The utility of fever, splenomegaly, hemoglobin level, and platelet and neutrophil counts at hospital admission as screening criteria for HLH was evaluated. For HLH patients who might be missed by screening based on the presence of fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias, a screening model using common laboratory parameters was developed. Following that, a three-step screening procedure was then developed.",
        "The criteria of cytopenias affecting two or more lineages plus fever or splenomegaly had a sensitivity of 51.9% and a specificity of 98.4% for identifying HLH in pediatric inpatients. Our screening score model comprises six parameters: splenomegaly, platelet count, neutrophil count, albumin level, total bile acid level, and lactate dehydrogenase level. The use of the validation set had a sensitivity of 87.0% and a specificity of 90.6%. A three-step screening procedure has been developed: Step 1: Is fever or splenomegaly present? (Yes: risk for HLH should be considered, go to Step 2; No: less likely HLH); Step 2: Are cytopenias affecting at least two lineages? (Yes: consider HLH; No: go to Step 3); Step 3: Calculate the screening score. Is the sum of the score greater than 37? (Yes: consider HLH; No: less likely HLH). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the three-step screening procedure were 91.9% and 94.4%, respectively.",
        "A significant proportion of pediatric HLH patients present at the hospital without having all three symptoms: fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias. Our three-step screening procedure, utilizing commonly available clinical and laboratory parameters, can effectively identify pediatric patients who may be at high risk for HLH."
