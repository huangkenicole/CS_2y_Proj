        "Ninety-seven primary-care physicians, including 73 family physicians and 24 pediatricians, were surveyed in order to ascertain their knowledge and attitudes regarding fever in children 3 months to 2 years of age. A rectal temperature between 37.0 degrees C and 37.9 degrees C was considered to indicate fever by 35% of physicians. Only 17% believed there was no danger from fever, while 12% believed that fever could cause brain damage. Seizures were considered a principal danger of fever by 49% of physicians, and 22% believed that brain damage could result from typical febrile seizures. While 70% chose relief of discomfort as the main purpose of antipyretic treatment, 30% would use temperature alone as an indication for antipyretics. It is concluded that although many physicians have an acceptable attitude toward the diagnosis and management of fever, a significant number still have exaggerated concerns."
