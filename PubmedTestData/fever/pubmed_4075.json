        "Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease and a major cause of morbidity worldwide presenting with varying clinical manifestations. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and complications of brucellosis at the Van Training and Research Hospital from January 2018 to December 2018.",
        "210 patients with brucellosis were assessed retrospectively. The clinical histories and signs, laboratory findings, therapeutic features and complications of these patients were obtained by examining their medical files.",
        "Of the 210 patients;, the most common symptoms were myalgia (87.6%), arthralgia (76.2%) and fever (72.4%). The most frequent clinical signs were fever (72.4%) and arthritis (21.9%). Out of 210 patients, standard tube agglutination (STA) tests were positive in 208 (99%). Osteoarticular involvement (34.3%) was common, and a combination of rifampicin and doxycycline was the most frequently used antimicrobial regimen.",
        "It should be kept in mind that brucellosis may occur in patients presenting with fever, sweating, arthralgia and leukopenia, especially in endemic areas where dairy livestock is prevalent. People living in these areas should be educated about proper animal care and the handling of dairy products."
