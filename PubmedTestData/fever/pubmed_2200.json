        "To discover the central mechanisms of antipyretic effect of moxibustion and its relationship with the acupoint sensor so as to provide the scientific evidence for \"the treatment of heat syndrome with moxibustion\".",
        "Eighteen New Zealand Rabbits were randomly assigned into three groups, named group A (modeling with intravenous injection of Endotoxin), group B (moxibustion at 40 degrees C after Endotoxin injection) and group C (moxibustion at 48 degrees C after Endotoxin injection), 6 rabbits in each one. The experiment was undergoing in the condition of muscular relaxation and artificial respiration for the animals. The spotlight moxibustion at constant temperature was applied to \"Zhiyang\" (GV 9). The discharge of heat sensitive neurons (HSNs) at the preoptic region and anterior hypothalamus (POAH) was taken as the index. The impacts of the treatment on HSNs were observed in each group.",
        "Moxibustion had significant antagonism to the pyrogen on its inhibition to the activity of HSNs in the thermotaxic center. As a result, the antipyretic effect was obtained. It is concluded that the effective result of moxibustion is achieved by stimulating polymodal receptors of acupoints."
