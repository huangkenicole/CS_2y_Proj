        "Hyperthermia may be accompanied by dehydration with or without electrolyte loss. To determine the efficacy of hypertonic saline in dextran solution (HSD, 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran 70) for the treatment of heat stroke, rats were deprived of water for 24 h (DE) or not (ND), and then they were heat-stressed, and 4 mL/kg of saline (SAL) or HSD was administered via jugular cannula at the end of heat stress (a core temperature of 42.3 degrees C). The following four groups of 10 rats (Wistar-Furth) were used: NDSAL, DESAL, NDHSD, and DEHSD. Four control groups not subjected to heat stress were also studied. Percent change in plasma volume (PV) from baseline was significantly decreased by DE vs. ND (-6.8 +/- 1.2 vs. +4.6 +/- 1.6%) and increased by HSD vs. SAL (+10.1 +/- 4.1 vs. -3.5 +/- 1.6%) administration. Rats that were DE had significantly higher heating rates and less water loss during heat than ND rats, but hydration status was not correlated to 24 h survival. HSD groups had significantly higher PV and survival rates than their corresponding SAL groups regardless of hydrational status."
