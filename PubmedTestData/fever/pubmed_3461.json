        "Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever disease in the rural areas of east-central China, which is caused by SFTSV-a newly discovered bunyavirus. SFTSV is most likely transmitted by tick bites but can also be transmitted within human beings. The onset of SFTS is sudden and with rapid progress, with main clinical manifestations as fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and gastrointestinal and hepatorenal dysfunctions. Some patients may die from multiple organ failure, and the case fatality rate is approximately 10%. In this paper, we use the method of literature review to summarize the recent research progress of SFTS which includes the epidemic distribution characteristics, medium of transmission, host animals, transmission routes and susceptibility in the general population."
