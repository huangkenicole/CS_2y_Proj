        "The objective of the study was to determine whether precise estimation of rectal temperature of pigs is possible by taking their skin temperature in consideration of different factors as body weight, ambient temperature and relative air humidity. Therefore skin temperature of 272 pigs (7-222 kg BW) was measured by direct (thermo couple element) and indirect (infrared thermometer) methods at distinct localisations. In order to investigate different stages of pyretogenesis Escherichia coli endotoxin was administered to 30 of the pigs intravenously. A significant influence on skin temperature could be ascertained for the ambient temperature and the body weight, but not for the relative air humidity. From these data equations were established to estimate rectal temperature (RT) by measurement the skin temperature (ST) at the base of the ear: 1. Weaners and fattening pigs: RT = ST + 21.867 - 0.089x1 - 0.432x2 + 0.009x3, (r = 0.703) 2. Sows: RT = ST + 31.511 - 0.074x1 - 0.657x2 - 0.011x3, (r = 0.641) (x1 = ambient temperature, x2 = skin temperature, x3 = body weight) In spite of consideration of ambient temperature and body weight estimation of the rectal temperature was not suitable for clear detection of febrile pigs. Only in 35.45% of the younger pigs and in 29.30% of the sows a definite diagnose (fever yes/no) could be made. This method can only be used as a screening in the herd, if estimation of extreme values allowed the recognition of febrile illness. A follow-up control of the rectal temperature is always necessary in groups of animals, where estimations give no clear results."
