        "This is a case series of 3 children from a single family who developed symptomatic elemental mercury poisoning requiring hospitalization and chelation. The mercury exposure primarily occurred in the home but the mercury was also tracked to one of their schools requiring environmental cleanup at both the home and school. The clinical assessment and management, as well as public health investigation and response, are discussed. There are many lessons learned in this difficult, often delayed, diagnosis. Early recognition of this environmental toxic exposure is essential. Communication between the clinicians and public health officials played a critical role. Public education prevented panic. Proper environmental sampling, and assessment and management of those exposed, were a few of the many challenges faced in this complicated case series."
