        "Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common and important clinical problem in pediatric cancer. Our Institution has developed a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for treatment of FN to assist the clinicians taking care of these patients.",
        "To evaluate characteristics of FN, sources and causative agents of infection, applicability and effectiveness of the CPG, and factors that associated with response to treatment.",
        "The medical records of patients with FN that had completed data from September, 2003 to May, 2005 were reviewed and analysed.",
        "A total of 148 FN episodes in 90 patients were analysed. The predominant underlying malignancy was acute leukemia. About 50% had absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 100 cells/mm3 at the beginning and at reassesment on day 3 of treatment. The causes of infection with microbiological confirmation was 25%. Urinary tract infection was the predominant source of infection and gram negative bacteria was the predominant causative agent. Sixty-two percents responded to initial treatment without changing of antibiotics. Of all episodes, 91.2% were able to complete treatment according to the CPG. The mortality rate was 1.4%. ANC of less than 100 cell/mm3 on day 3 of treatment was the significant risk factor for prolonged duration of fever and unresponsiveness to low risk regimen of antibiotics. ANC of less than 100 cell/mm3 on day 3, having hematologic malignancies, and recurrent fever were associated risks for the need for antifungal agent or referral to infectious diseases specialist or death. The pretreatment ANC more than 100 cells/mm3 was a significant predictor for the responsiveness to low risk regimen without recurrent fever.",
        "Our CPG could practically be applied in FN patients and resulted in low mortality rate."
