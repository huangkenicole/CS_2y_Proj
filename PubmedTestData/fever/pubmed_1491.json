        "To evaluate the effects of homoeopathic ultrahigh dilutions of Aconitum napellus in Baker's yeast-induced fever in rabbits.",
        "Rabbits were divided into 4 groups and each group contained 6 rabbits. Baker's yeast suspension (20%) was injected subcutaneously. After fever induction, paracetamol and homoeopathic ultrahigh dilutions (A. napellus 200c and 1 000c) were given orally. Rectal temperature was measured with digital thermometer hourly.",
        "Fever was induced in all the rabbits after 4 hours of Baker's yeast administration. A. napellus 200c and 1000c significantly reduced the temperature (P < 0.05). In positive control, temperature decrease was more significant (P < 0.001).",
        "The above findings indicate the effectiveness of ultrahigh dilutions of A. napellus in Baker's yeast-induced fever in rabbits. However, the effects were slower and less significant than standard medicine. Moreover, future research is required to know their mechanism of reducing temperature."
