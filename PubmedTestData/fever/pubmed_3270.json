        "Describe the causes of fever in HIV-1 infected adults in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.",
        "Exhaustive analysis of all the morbid episodes with raise in temperature to above 37.5 degrees C in patients followed-up prospectively, within the framework of the ANRS 059 study from April 1996 to March 1998.",
        "One hundred and four patients presented 269 episodes of fever. At the start of these episodes, the mean CD4 count was of 311/mm3, fever had lasted a mean of 3.4 days and mean body temperature was 38.7 degrees C. The 269 episodes lead to 288 diagnoses: 152 specific etiologic diagnoses and 136 non-specific syndrome diagnoses. Community bacterial infections represented 55% of the specific diagnoses, followed by malaria (16%) and tuberculosis (12%). The mean CD4 count during the bacterial episodes was 208/mm3, in malaria 384/mm3 and in tuberculosis 245/mm3. Non-typhi salmonella, pneumococci and Escherischia coli represented 37%, 32%, and 15% respectively of the bacteria isolated. The mean duration between the first and last day of fever was 8.4 days. This time lapse was superior or equal to 30 days in 22 episodes (8%), 50% of which were mycobacterioses (36% tuberculosis and 14% atypic mycobacterioses). Nineteen episodes (7%) lead to death within a mean delay of 58 days. The first cause of death was atypic mycobacteriosis (26%). Death was significantly associated with a CD4 count < 200/mm3 and to prolongation of fever for more than 30 days.",
        "Other than the frequently described role of tuberculosis in HIV morbidity in sub-Saharian Africa, the role of bacterial diseases, responsible for early death, potentially severe, but curable should be underlined. The diffusion of antibiotic treatment algorithms adapted to the principle clinical syndromes encountered, might improve the treatment of adults infected by HIV consulting in sub-Saharian Africa."
