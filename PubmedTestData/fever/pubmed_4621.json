        "The clinical course of 126 hospitalized patients during 192 episodes of granulocytopenia and fever was studied. Fever was a regular accompaniment of granulocytopenia, occurring in 94 per cent of granulocytopenic episodes. The mean duration of granulocytopenia (less than 1,000/mm3) was 18 days, with fever (temperature greater than 38 degrees C) being present during 44 per cent of those days. Fever was present during 69 per cent of days with a granulocyte count less than 10/mm3. A presumed infection was present in 86 of 128 febrile granulocytopenic episodes in adults and in 19 of 64 febrile granulocytopenic episodes in children. A fungal infection was found in 11 patients; a viral infection in 23 patients. Bacteremia occurred during 44 granulocytopenic episodes with 16.8 bacteremias/1,000 days of granulocytopenia in adults and 12.7 bacteremias/1,000 days in children. The mortality was 33 per cent per granulocytopenic episode in adults and only 8 per cent per episode in children."
