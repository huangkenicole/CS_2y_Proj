        "Cancerous fever is one of the common symptoms of advanced malignant tumors,which seriously affects the quality of life and survival of patients. At present,the clinical research on the treatment of cancerous fever by traditional Chinese medicine is limited,and there is a lack of research on the medication rules from multiple dimensions of disease-symptom-syndrome. The treatment of cancerous fever has not made substantial progress. In this study,we collected the literature on treatment of cancerous fever in Chinese medicine,and concluded that common syndrome types include Yin deficiency type,Qi deficiency type,Yang deficiency type,blood stasis type,damp-heat accumulation type,toxic heat flourishing type and liver meridian stagnated heat type. Two hundreds and fifty-seven prescriptions for Chinese medicine and 249 flavors for single medicine were extracted. The analysis of the drug composition of the drug found that the cancerous fever treatment was mainly based on heat-clearing drugs and deficiency-nourishing drugs. Apriori association analysis of the drug found that the second and third related drugs were mainly Rehmanniae Radix,Moutan Cortex,Artemisiae Annuae Herba,Trionycis Carapax and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma. The top five gray correlation degrees were Psoraleae Fructus,Bupleuri Radix,Hordei Fructus Germinatus,Scutellariae Radix and Massa Medicata Fermentata. And seven new prescriptions were evolved. The results showed that the treatment of cancerous fever can be started from the disease-symptom-syndrome,nourishing Yin and clearing heat is an important method for \" disease differentiation and treatment\". The combination of Bupleuri Radix and Scutellariae Radix is the embodiment of \" symptom differentiation and treatment\". The new prescriptions conform to the idea of \" syndrome differentiation and treatment\" of traditional Chinese medicine can provide reference for clinical medication. The grey screening method combined with multivariate analysis method was used to analyze the prescription rules of Chinese medicine in the treatment of cancer fever,which followed the black box structure of traditional Chinese medicine,made the potential rule of prescriptions explicit,broadened its thinking of Chinese medicine treatment,and made up for the deficiency of traditional analysis methods."
