        "Fever in neutropenia (FN) remains an unavoidable, potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy. Timely administration of empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics has become standard of care. But the impact of time to antibiotics (TTA), the lag period between recognition of fever or arrival at the hospital to start of antibiotics, remains unclear. Here we aimed to analyze the association between TTA and safety relevant events (SRE) in data from a prospective multicenter study. We analyzed the association between time from recognition of fever to start of antibiotics (TTA) and SRE (death, admission to intensive care unit, severe sepsis and bacteremia) with three-level mixed logistic regression. We adjusted for possible triage bias using a propensity score and stratified the analysis by severity of disease at presentation with FN. We analyzed 266 FN episodes, including 53 (20%) with SRE, reported in 140 of 269 patients recruited from April 2016 to August 2018. TTA (median, 120\u00a0min; interquartile range, 49-180\u00a0min) was not associated with SRE, with a trend for less SREs in episodes with longer TTA. Analyses applying the propensity score suggested a relevant triage bias. Only in patients with severe disease at presentation there was a trend for an association of longer TTA with more SRE. In conclusion, TTA was unrelated to poor clinical outcome in pediatric patients with FN presenting without severe disease. We saw strong evidence for triage bias which could only be partially adjusted."
