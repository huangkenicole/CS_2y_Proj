        "'Central' fevers are thought to result from disruption of hypothalamic thermoregulatory pathways following severe brain injuries. Bromocriptine, due to its central dopamine receptor agonism, has been hypothesized to have antipyretic effect in this setting. However, clinical evidence for this off-label use is limited to a few case reports. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the effect of bromocriptine administration on body temperature in acute brain injury patients with suspected central fever.",
        "We screened a cohort of adult patients that received bromocriptine in the neurologic-intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital between January 2018 and December 2021. Indication of central fever was ascertained by review of clinical documentation. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was used to model temperature as a function of time relative to bromocriptine initiation. We adjusted for potential confounding due to the following covariates: temperature recording method (invasive vs surface), concurrent antipyretic administration within 8\u00a0h, and surface cooling device use within 4\u00a0h of temperature measurement. Temperature-time function was modeled using a cubic spline with k\u2009=\u200910 knots.",
        "A total of 33 patients were included in the analysis (14 women; mean age: 50 y, standard deviation 14 y). Median dose of bromocriptine was 7.5\u00a0mg (range 2.5-40) for a median of 13 d (range 5-160). Age and sex did not impact the function of temperature over time. Predicted temperatures were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) higher by 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C with invasive compared to surface recording methods, lower by 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of cooling device use and lower by 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C with concurrent antipyretic use. On adjusted analysis with the GAMM, there was decline (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in temperature following bromocriptine initiation by\u2009-\u20090.3\u00a0\u00b0C at 24\u00a0h,\u2009-\u20090.5\u00a0\u00b0C at 48\u00a0h, and\u2009-\u20090.7\u00a0\u00b0C at 72\u00a0h.",
        "Bromocriptine use was associated with modest but statistically significant decline in temperature, with nadir at 72\u00a0h post initiation. The findings provide a data driven basis for prospective evaluation."
