      "AbstractText": [
        "After COVID-19 vaccination was initiated, the number of patients visiting the emergency department (ED) with vaccine-related adverse reactions increased. We investigated the clinical features of older adults (aged 65 years and older) visiting the ED with self-reported COVID-19 postvaccination fever.",
        "We conducted a retrospective observational study at three EDs between March 2021 and September 2021. Patients who reported adverse reactions, fever (\u226537.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and/or febrile sensation or rigors following COVID-19 vaccination were included. The demographic and clinical data of these patients were collected by reviewing their medical records.",
        "A total of 562 patients were selected, and 396 (70.5%) were female. The older adult group included 155 (27.6%) patients, and the median age was 75 (69-79 years). The older adults less frequently had a fever (\u226537.5\u00a0\u00b0C) upon ED presentation (75.5% vs. 85.7%, respectively), used more emergency medical services (43.9% vs. 18.7%, respectively), and visited an ED more frequently during early hours (00:00-06:00) (31% vs. 20.1%, respectively) compared to the younger adults (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Fewer older adults visited an ED within 2 days of fever onset (73.5% vs. 84%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), and more older adults were admitted for medical conditions other than vaccine-related adverse reactions (32.9% vs. 4.2%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Older adults received more thorough testing (laboratory and imaging tests). Among the older adults, the admission rate was associated with age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).",
        "Older adults presenting with fever as an adverse reaction following COVID-19 vaccination less frequently had a fever upon visiting the ED, required more ED testing, and had higher admission rates for non-vaccination-related medical conditions."
