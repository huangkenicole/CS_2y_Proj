        "Although fever is a common symptom, few studies have broadly addressed this as a clinical problem in general practice. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of fever among general practice patients in two rural municipalities in Norway, the diagnoses (according to ICHPPC-2-def.) of conditions causing fever, and the receptionist's role in the management of these problems. All the general practitioners and their receptionists within the study area participated. During 4 weeks throughout 1988 all individuals attending their general practitioner had their body temperature measured with an electronic thermometer (orally > or = 7 years, rectally < 7 years). Fever was defined as an oral body temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C (rectally > or = 38.0 degrees C in those < 7 years). All telephone applications, including telephone encounters for fever, were recorded. Fever was detected in 80 (5%) of a total of 1610 direct encounters: 36% of those below 7 years of age (n = 70) were febrile. One-third of the total encounters for fever were telephone encounters (n = 36), of which 30% were managed by the receptionists. A wide range of diagnoses were made, most of which were associated with infectious diseases. The distribution of the diagnoses of primary care patients with fever is different from those admitted to hospital for fever of unknown origin. General practitioners and their receptionists should consider fever a diagnostic challenge, especially when the patient is handled over the telephone."
