      "AbstractText": [
        "Calcium dobesilate, a vasoprotective and antioxidant agent, is gradually being used for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Calcium dobesilate-induced hyperpyrexia is a rare clinical event, and few studies have reported it.",
        "The patient took calcium dobesilate, which caused high fever. After stopping calcium dobesilate, his body temperature returned to normal.",
        "Based on the medical history, symptoms and signs, the patient was diagnosed with drug fever caused by calcium dobesilate.",
        "Calcium dobesilate was stopped, and supportive treatment was given at the same time.",
        "The present case was initially misdiagnosed as a fever caused by a bacterial infection, but treatment with the antibiotic moxifloxacin was ineffective. Based on the patient's medical history, laboratory and examination results, body temperature changes, and Naranjo Advanced Drug Response Scale, calcium dobesilate-induced hyperpyrexia was diagnosed. After discontinuation of calcium dobesilate, the patient's body temperature normalized, and no additional episode of fever was observed at follow-up.",
        "Moreover, misdiagnosis and mistreatment of this condition can deteriorate the patient's condition. Herein, we report a case of calcium dobesilate-induced hyperpyrexia that occurred during the treatment of chronic renal insufficiency. Subsequently, a systematic analysis of the patient's diagnosis and treatment was reviewed. If unexplained high fever develops during the use of calcium dobesilate, calcium dobesilate-induced hyperpyrexia should be considered. Accordingly, calcium dobesilate should be discontinued."
