        "Fever in infants and children frequently causes considerable concern for parents and physicians. It is one of the most common reasons that parents seek medical attention for their children, accounting for 1/3 of pediatric office and emergency department visits. About 14-20 percent of febrile children have fever without an apparent source of infection after history and physical examination. Physician concerns stem largely from the recognition that some of these febrile children are at risk for developing serious bacterial illness and may have early stage of an infection, including bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), occult pneumonia or, rarely, early bacterial meningitis. This article reviews the evaluation and management of children with fever which is the only alarming symptom of infection. A cautious approach should still be taken based on the potential for adverse consequences of unrecognized and untreated serious bacterial infection."
