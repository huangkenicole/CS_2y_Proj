        "Cancer is associated with a variety of complications, including neutropenic fever, which can result in severe morbidity and mortality. This oncologic emergency requires ED management.",

        "Neutropenic fever is defined by fever with oral temperature >38.3\u00b0C or temperature >38.0\u00b0C for 1 hour with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1000 cells/microL. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 6 weeks of presentation are at high risk for neutropenia. While most patients with neutropenic fever do not have an identifiable bacterial source of fever, clinicians should treat patients for bacterial infection. Rapid assessment and management are vital to improving outcomes in patients with suspected or confirmed neutropenic fever. History and examination should focus on the most common sites of infection: the gastrointestinal tract, blood, skin, lung, and urinary tract. However, physical examination and laboratory or imaging assessment may not display classic signs of infection. Blood cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended. Oncology consultation is an integral component in the care of these patients. Several risk scores can assist in stratifying patients who may be appropriate for discharge home and follow-up.",
