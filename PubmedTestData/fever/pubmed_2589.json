        "Considerable variation in the management of fever and neutropenia (FN) exists, with factors associated with treatment variation not well described. An online survey of 90 pediatric cancer providers in Michigan was performed in Spring 2014. The survey frame was pediatric patients with cancer receiving treatment, with a Port-a-cath, who were clinically stable. Criteria for \"Decreased\" and \"Increased\" risk groups were defined by respondents. Survey questions addressed FN definitions, risk groups conceptualization, routine clinical practice, and management guidelines, in the context of risk groups and distance to treating institution. Fifty providers responded (56%); the majority defined a febrile event as temperature >38.3\u00b0C and/or 2 events >38.0\u00b0C\u00a0within a 24-hour period. Neutropenia was defined as current or anticipated absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/\u03bcL. Majority of respondents recommended \"Decreased\" and \"Increased\" patients present to a local emergency department (ED) if they live >2\u00a0hours away. Respondents were significantly more likely to have a \"Decreased Risk\" patient travel over 2\u00a0hours if they rated the local ED as \"Poor to Fair\" on ability to access Port-a-caths (P = .048). Most respondents would discharge patients who are afebrile for 24\u00a0hours, blood cultures negative for 48\u00a0hours, and neutrophil count of greater than 200/\u03bcL; 40% preferred discharge on oral antibiotics when the ANC <500/\u03bcL. Triaging for febrile pediatric patients with cancer is significantly influenced by the providers' perceptions of local EDs. Future investigation of local hospitals' ability to provide urgent evaluation, combined with parental perspectives, could lead to improvements in timely and effective management."
