        "The present study was designed to assess the accuracy of tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) in predicting \"core\" body temperature and to compare rectal temperature (RT) and TMT in febrile pediatric patients with and without meningitis. Sixty children diagnosed as having meningitis by cerebro-spinal fluid (CDF) analysis formed the cases and 60 non-meningitic febrile patients, chosen as continuous enrollment, formed the controls. Rectal and ear temperatures were assessed in both groups. Ear temperature was significantly higher in cases as compared to controls. The difference between reading of ear temperature and rectal temperature was also significantly higher in cases as compared to controls. Significant correlations were seen between ear temperature and various parameters of CSF profile."
