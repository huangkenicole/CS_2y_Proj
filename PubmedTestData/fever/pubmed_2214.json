        "Patient remained febrile despite broad spectrum antibiotics. All cultures were negative. CT angiogram of the chest was done, eliciting a large saddle embolus.",
        "Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was administered and subsequently started on anticoagulation. Patient became afebrile 3 days after initiation of anticoagulation and all antibiotics were discontinued.",

        "It is imperative to include pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis, when presented with high-grade fever in patients with unclear diagnosis."
