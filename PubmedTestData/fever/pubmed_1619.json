        "Exertional heat stroke is defined as hyperthermia associated with neurological signs related to intense physical activity performed in a hot environment. This is a medical emergency and life-threatening. In this study, we investigated four cases of exertional heat stroke hospitalized at the military hospital in Tunis (Tunisia) to describe the clinical, therapeutic and preventive characteristics and factors favoring this disease. Four young soldiers, 23 to 44 years older, have developed Exertional heat stroke after Intense and prolonged exercise. Exercises were performed in May and June, in high ambient temperature, high humidity and lack of wind. Three soldiers were in battle dress, a backpack and their weapon. Our four subjects had overweight, were not sufficiently trained and were highly motivated. Insufficient hydration and a diet rich in carbohydrates were noted. Upon hospitalization, patients were febrile and had neurological disorders, neuromuscular disorders, rhabdomyolysis and hemoconcentration. The medical care consisted of a rehydration and oxygen."
