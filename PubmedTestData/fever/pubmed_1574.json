        "12 European EDs.",
        "Consecutive febrile children <18 years between January 2017 and April 2018.",
        "Children with fever \u22655\u2009days and their risks for serious bacterial infection (SBI) were compared with children with fever <5\u2009days, including diagnostic accuracy of non-specific symptoms, warning signs and C-reactive protein (CRP; mg/L).",
        "SBI and other non-infectious serious illness.",
        "3778/35 705 (10.6%) of febrile children had fever \u22655\u2009days. Incidence of SBI in children with fever \u22655\u2009days was higher than in those with fever <5\u2009days (8.4% vs 5.7%). Triage urgency, life-saving interventions and intensive care admissions were similar for fever \u22655\u2009days and <5\u2009days. Several warning signs had good rule in value for SBI with specificities >0.90, but were observed infrequently (range: 0.4%-17%). Absence of warning signs was not sufficiently reliable to rule out SBI (sensitivity 0.92 (95% CI 0.87-0.95), negative likelihood ratio (LR) 0.34 (0.22-0.54)). CRP <20\u2009mg/L was useful for ruling out SBI (negative LR 0.16 (0.11-0.24)). There were 66 cases (1.7%) of non-infectious serious illnesses, including 21 cases of Kawasaki disease (0.6%), 28 inflammatory conditions (0.7%) and 4 malignancies.",
        "Children with prolonged fever have a higher risk of SBI, warranting a careful clinical assessment and diagnostic workup. Warning signs of SBI occurred infrequently but, if present, increased the likelihood of SBI. Although rare, clinicians should consider important non-infectious causes of prolonged fever."
