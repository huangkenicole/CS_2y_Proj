        "We encountered two consecutive cases of adult-onset Kawasaki disease (AKD) that were difficult to diagnose. In both cases, Kawasaki disease was not considered as a differential diagnosis in the early stages. However, it was possible to make a diagnosis by citing the disease as a differential diagnosis and introducing the patients to the pediatrics department. AKD has a minimal incidence rate and may have a clinical course different from that of childhood-onset Kawasaki disease. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate Kawasaki disease into the differentiation of an adult fever and to consult with a pediatrician for its diagnosis."
