        "Unexplained fever is one of the most common and difficult diagnostic problems faced daily by clinicians. This study evaluated the differences in health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care provided to patients with unexplained fever before and after global budget (GB) implementation in Taiwan.The National Health Insurance Research Database was used for analyzing the health care expenditures and quality of care before and after implementation of the GB system. Patients diagnosed as having unexplained fever during 2000-2001 were recruited; their 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 data were considered baseline and postintervention data, respectively.Data of 259 patients with unexplained fever were analyzed. The mean lengths of stay (LOSs) before and after GB system implementation were 4.22\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.35\u200adays and 5.29\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.70\u200adays, respectively. The mean costs of different health care expenditures before and after implementation of the GB system were as follows: the mean diagnostic, drug, therapy, and total costs increased respectively from New Taiwan Dollar (NT$) 1440.05\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$97.43, NT$3249.90\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$1108.27, NT$421.03\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$100.03, and NT$13,866.77\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$2,114.95 before GB system implementation to NT$2224.34\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$238.36, NT$4272.31\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$1466.90, NT$2217.03\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$672.20, and NT$22,856.41\u200a\u00b1\u200aNT$4,196.28 after implementation. The mean rates of revisiting the emergency department within 3 days and readmission within 14 days increased respectively from 10.5%\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.7% and 8.3%\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.4% before implementation to 6.3%\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.2% and 4.0%\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.7% after implementation.GB significantly increased LOS and incremental total costs for patients with unexplained fever; but improved the quality of care."
