        "Fever can occur after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The influence of body temperature (BT) after hospital arrival on patients with acute MI has rarely been investigated.",
        "Patients who were diagnosed with acute MI in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary teaching hospital between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020 were enrolled. Based on the tympanic temperature obtained at the ED triage, patients were categorized into normothermic (35.5\u00b0C-37.5\u00b0C), hypothermic (<\u200935.5\u00b0C), or hyperthermic (>\u200937.5\u00b0C) groups. The primary outcome was in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), while the secondary outcomes were adverse events. Statistical significance was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05.",
        "There were 440 enrollees; significant differences were found among the normothermic (n\u2009=\u2009369, 83.9%), hypothermic (n\u2009=\u200927, 6.1%), and hyperthermic (n\u2009=\u200944, 10.0%) groups in the triage respiratory rate (median [IQR]) (20.0 [4.0] cycles/min versus 20.0 [4.0] versus 20.0 [7.5], p\u2009=\u20090.009), triage heart rate (88.0 [29.0] beats/min versus 82.0 [28.0] versus 102.5 [30.5], p\u2009<\u20090.001), presence of ST-elevation MI (42.0% versus 66.7% versus 31.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.014), need for cardiac catheterization (87.3% versus 85.2% versus 72.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.034), initial troponin T level (165.9 [565.2] ng/L versus 49.1 [202.0] versus 318.8 [2002.0], p\u2009=\u20090.002), peak troponin T level (343.8 [1405.9] ng/L versus 218.7 [2318.2] versus 832.0 [2640.8], p\u2009=\u20090.003), length of ICU stay (2.0 [3.0] days versus 3.0 [8.0] versus 3.0 [9.5], p\u2009=\u20090.006), length of hospital stay (4.0 [4.5] days versus 6.0 [15.0] versus 10.5 [10.8], p\u2009<\u20090.001), and infection during hospitalization (19.8% versus 29.6% versus 63.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) but not in IHCA (7.6% versus 14.8% versus 11.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.323) or any adverse events (50.9% versus 48.1% versus 63.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.258). Multivariable analysis showed no significant association of triage BT with IHCA or any major complication.",
        "Triage BT did not show a significant association with IHCA or adverse events in patients with acute MI. However, triage BT could be associated with different clinical presentations and should warrant further investigation."
