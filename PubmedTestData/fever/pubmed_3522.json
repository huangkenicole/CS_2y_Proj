        "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a viral hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. However, effective treatments for SFTS cases not responded to supportive therapy have not been established. Herein, we introduced the therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in SFTS patients in a tertiary hospital between 2013 and 2015.",
        "TPE was performed in patients with rapidly progressing SFTS. Clinical, laboratory, and virological parameters were compared before and after TPE.",
        "Among 27 confirmed SFTS patients, two patients were treated with TPE and ribavirin combination in May 2013, then, 14 patients with rapidly progressing SFTS patients were treated with only TPE from June 2013 to September 2015: their median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50 to 70) and eight (57.1%) were male. Body temperature, pressure-adjusted heart rate, white blood cell and platelet counts, coagulation profile, serum creatinine, and multiple organ dysfunction score improved immediately after TPE. In addition, the mean cyclic threshold value of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SFTS virus after TPE (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 31.3 \u00b1 2.9) was significantly higher than that before TPE (26.5 \u00b1 2.9; p < 0.001), indicating that serum viral loads decreased after TPE. Finally, 13 of 14 TPE-treated patients (92.8%) recovered from rapidly progressing SFTS without sequelae.",
        "SFTS patients treated with TPE showed improvements in clinical, laboratory, and virological parameters. These results suggest that TPE would be a therapeutic modality as rescue therapy in patients with rapidly progressing SFTS."
