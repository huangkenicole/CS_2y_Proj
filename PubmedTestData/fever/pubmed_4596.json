        "To assess the accuracy of tactile examination by mothers as a method of fever determination in their children and thus determine the reliability of mothers' history about the presence or absence of fever in their children.",
        "A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in four health centers randomly selected in Osogbo metropolis. Three hundred mothers were studied, a semi-structured questionnaire was utilized.",
        "The study found the sensitivity and specificity of tactile examination for mothers as a means of detecting fever in their children to be 82.3% and 54.1% respectively. Mother's socio-demographic characteristics and the age of child did not affect mother's subjective assessment of childhood fever (p>0.05).",
        "Mothers are able to provide accurate information about the presence or absence of fever in their children by palpation without the use of a thermometer. Tactile examination was found to be adequate for mothers as a means of detecting fever in their children. Physicians should accept as reliable mothers' history of fever and give prompt management."
