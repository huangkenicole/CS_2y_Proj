      "AbstractText": [
        "The heart rate (HR) induced by maximal beta-adrenergic activation, which was elicited by infusion of isoproterenol, was studied in 8 healthy horses before (control) and after hyperthermia was induced by IV administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Isoproterenol was administered IV at 1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 3 minutes, and the HR was determined during the final 30 seconds of the infusion. As the rectal temperature increased (P less than 0.001) from 38.2 +/- 0.1 C (mean +/- SEM; normothermic control) to 40.1 +/- 0.1 C at 60 minutes after DNP administration, the isoproterenol-induced HR also increased from 198 +/- 4 beats/min (control) to 214 +/- 4 beats/min (P less than 0.001). It appeared that the values of HR achieved with maximal beta-adrenergic activation were augmented by the hypermetabolic, hyperthermic state induced by DNP."
