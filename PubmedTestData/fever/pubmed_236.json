        "The febrile mechanism in all vertebrates involves endogenous molecules which mediate and attenuate the fever response. This mechanism is considered phylogenetically conserved, and the molecules are thought to be analogous in different species. The above notion is supported by evidence which show avian and mammalian fevers to have similar mediators. There is, however, a paucity of information regarding the modulators of the avian febrile response. Natriuretic peptides were shown to modulate mammalian fevers and, although natriuretic peptides are also present in birds, they have never been investigated in the context of fever. We induced fever in Pekin ducks with lipopolysaccharide and, at the same time, treated the animals with natriuretic peptide antiserum at a dose that effectively inhibited the known renal actions of endogenously secreted natriuretic peptide. We compared fever responses after ducks received either the antiserum or an appropriate control along with the lipopolysaccharide. The antiserum did not attenuate the fever responses of ducks. Our results differ from the results of a study in rats, which demonstrated natriuretic peptides to be potently antipyretic. This molecule seems to be antipyretic in mammals but not in ducks. We suggest a species variation regarding the ability of natriuretic peptides to modulate fever."
