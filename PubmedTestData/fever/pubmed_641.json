        "Fever (\u226538\u00b0C) in young infants (<90 days of age) represents a common clinical challenge for pediatricians in both outpatient and inpatient settings. While the majority of febrile infants will ultimately be determined to have no serious infection, serious infections when present can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Since the evaluation and empiric treatment of presumptive serious infection has associated risks (e.g. medication side effects, stress/disruption of hospitalization, nosocomial infection, etc.) as well as substantial costs, attempts have been made to clearly define an accurate method that enables clinicians to correctly stratify which infants are at relatively low risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI) and may therefore be safely managed less aggressively. Although this topic has been extensively studied and discussed, no single protocol has been universally adopted and clinical practices continue to vary. This paper discusses multiple distinct protocols currently in use, as well as the evidence upon which they are based and the points on which the evidence is not yet definitive."
