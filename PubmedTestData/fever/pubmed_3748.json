        "To explore Turkish parents' practices in childhood fever management.",
        "A cross-sectional study with 205 randomly selected Turkish parents of febrile children 6-months to 5-years from the paediatric hospital and two family health centres in Sakarya, Turkey in 2009. Data explored general fever management practices on the 8-item Parents' Fever Management Scale - Turkish version (5-point Liket scale; 1=never to 5=always) and socio-demographics.",
        "Parents wanted to know their child's temperature (61.5%), took temperatures (60%), slept in the same room (58.5%) and sought medical advice (53.7%). Non-evidence-based-practices included over-the-counter medications (42.4%); waking children during the night for fever reducing medication (33.2%). Evidence-based-practice ensured febrile children had plenty to drink (30.2%) and febrile children were checked during the night (59%).",
        "Parents' reports indicate high levels of concern about fever, overuse of over-the-counter medications and health services. Practices increase parents' burden of care, are disruptive of family life and lead to parental fatigue. The study confirms the appropriateness and applicability of the fever management instrument, a simple tool to incorporate into assessment of febrile children, in identifying Turkish parents' fever management practice."
