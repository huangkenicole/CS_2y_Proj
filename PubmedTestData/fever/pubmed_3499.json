      "AbstractText": [
        "We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of piperacillin-ofloxacin as an empiric treatment of fever in patients with neutropenia. 24 febrile episodes occurring in 21 patients (mean neutropenia: 204/mm3) were treated. The neutropenia was due to an hematologic malignancy in 6 cases and to chemotherapy in 15 cases. Fever was related to septicemia in 4 cases, urinary tract infection in 1 case, other infectious sites without microbiological documentation in 11 cases, and was of unknown origin in 8 cases. Empirical therapy was started within 24 hours of the occurrence of fever greater than 38.5 degrees C with the combination of intravenous piperacillin (12 g/day in 3 divided doses) and oral ofloxacin (400 mg/day in 2 doses). The overall response rate was 86% (19/22) of evaluable cases, with an immediate success rate (apyrexia within 48 hours) of 46%. Of the 3 failures, one was bacteriologically documented and was due to a multiply resistant strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (to which both piperacillin and ofloxacin were resistant). The therapy was clinically well tolerated in all except 3 patients, in whom intolerance to intravenous piperacillin was observed, leading to discontinuation of the drug in 2 cases. More extensive and comparative trials should better determine the place of this piperacillin-ofloxacin combination as first-line treatment of febrile episodes in patients with neutropenia."
