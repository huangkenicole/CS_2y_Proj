      "AbstractText": [
        "Background Belladonna and Pyrogenium are commonly used to treat fever in homeopathy. But in vivo antipyretic activity of these medicines is not reported yet. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrahigh dilutions of Belladonna (Bell) and Pyrogenium (Pyro) in fever model of rabbits induced by Baker's yeast. Methods Healthy, local strain rabbits (\u2642 and \u2640) were divided into seven groups (n=42): Normal control, negative control, standard control, pyro 1000c, pyro 200c, Bell 1000c and Bell 200c. Fever was induced by intra peritoneal injection of 135\u2009mg/kg Baker's yeast suspension. Rectal temperature was measured hourly. All the medicines were administered once a day. The results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. ANOVA and least significant difference post hoc test were applied for checking the level of significance, p-value of \u22640.05 was considered significant statistically. Results Pyro in both potencies significantly reduced fever in rabbits compared to negative control group, while both potencies of Bell were ineffective. Paracetamol and Pyro 1000c reduced by 1.2\u2006\u00b0C (39.7 \u00b1 0.1 to 38.5 \u00b1 0.1), while Pyro 200c reduced by 1\u2006\u00b0C temperature (39.7 \u00b1 0.5 to 38.7 \u00b1 0.2). Conclusions Pyro possesses marked antipyretic activity in rabbit's Baker's yeast fever model. It would embolden its clinical use in fever with more guarantee of its efficacy. However, caveat of small sample size necessitates replication of experiment in large sample size."
