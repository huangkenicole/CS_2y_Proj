        "The pyrogenic response of adult, unanesthetized guinea pigs to 2 mug/kg iv of Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin was measured at 27 and 7 degrees C ambient temperatures, both before and after an 8-wk exposure to 7 degrees C. There were no significant differences between the onset, maximum height, and total duration of the fevers produced before and after cold acclimation in both thermal environments. However, in 27 degrees C, before cold acclimation, fever production was associated with vigorous shivering activity; two temperature maxima typically developed. After cold acclimation, visible shivering was not detectable during pyrogenesis; moreover, only a single maximum occurred, culminating during the interval between the two rises previously. In 7 degrees C, shivering occurred in both the non-cold- and cold-acclimated endotoxin-treated guinea pigs, but the increase in oxygen consumption was significantly greater in the latter. These results indicated, therefore, that nonshivering (NST) replaces shivering thermogenesis (ST) in a thermoneutral, while ST is added onto NST in a cold, environment in cold-acclimated guinea pigs in supplying the necessary heat for fever production, and that these effects involve alterations in the character of the febrile course."
