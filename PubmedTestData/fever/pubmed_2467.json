        "Management of body temperature is considered crucial in the management of acute stroke patients. Hyperthermia exacerbates ischaemic neuronal injury and physiological dysfunction. Hypothermia has been suggested as the \"gold standard\" for neuroprotection to which new pharmacological therapies should be compared. This article reviews the literature on the predictive role of admission body temperature on the outcomes of patients with stroke. We also examined the derived effect of using hypothermic procedures and antipyretic agents as a treatment measure in acute stroke patients for improving outcomes. Immediate effective treatment of the fever, while simultaneously evaluating its origin, is found to be crucial in the acute stroke for improving outcomes. The hypothermic effect of acetaminophen as a preventive measure for all patients requires further evaluation."
