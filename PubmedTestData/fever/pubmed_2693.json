        "Exposure to infectious disease increases in tandem with international travel rates. Globally, up to 70% of travelers to developing countries report health problems while traveling, most being self-limiting. Few travelers are ill enough to seek medical care while abroad or upon returning home. Although fever is one of the more common symptoms in these travelers, little attention has been paid to those who return with fever and neurologic symptoms. This article describes conditions that can present with fever and neurologic changes and how to evaluate patients in a timely manner to prevent progression of neural dysfunction and spread of disease in local communities."
