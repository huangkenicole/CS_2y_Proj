        "To identify the incidence, etiology, and risk factors for fevers in individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "A retrospective review of the medical records of consecutive adult traumatic SCI patients over a 2-year period was performed.",
        "The study was performed at a tertiary care, Level I trauma center.",
        "Consecutive adult traumatic SCI admissions to acute care (n = 48) and rehabilitation (n = 40) were included in the study.",
        "Incidence, etiology, mean maximum temperature elevation, and duration of fevers (temperature >99.9 F) were measured.",
        "The incidence of fever was 60.4% and 50% (acute care and rehabilitation, respectively). Total number of fevers was 58 and 66, acute and rehabilitation, respectively. Respiratory and urinary tract were the most common identifiable fever etiologies. Unidentified fever etiologies were numerous in both the acute and rehabilitation groups, representing 66% and 56% of cases, respectively. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between identified vs unidentified fever etiology groups for mean maximal temperature (102.5 degrees F vs 101.1 degrees F on acute and 101.5 degrees F vs 100.7 degrees F on rehabilitation), duration of fever (10.3 days vs 2.2 on acute and 2.8 days vs 1.3 on rehabilitation), fevers above 101.4 degrees F (75% vs 29% on acute and 40% vs 8% on rehabilitation), cause of injury (gunshot wound on acute care) and completeness of injury (American Spinal Injury Association classification A on rehabilitation).",
        "This study suggests that fevers occur commonly in patients with SCI, with respiratory and genitourinary system etiologies most commonly identified. Unidentified etiologies were common and were associated with lower temperature elevation and shorter fever duration. Injury etiology and completeness of injury may comprise additional risk factors. These factors should be taken into account when initiating cost-efficient fever workup in individuals with SCI."
