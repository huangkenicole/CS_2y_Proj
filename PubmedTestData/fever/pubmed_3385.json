        "No evidence can be found in the medical literature about the efficacy of alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen treatment in children with refractory fever.",
        "Our objective was to assess the effect of alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen therapy on distress and refractory fever compared with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as monotherapy in febrile children.",
        "A total of 474 febrile children with axillary temperature \u226538.5\u00a0\u00b0C and fever history \u22643\u00a0days in a tertiary hospital were randomly assigned to receive either (1) alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen (acetaminophen 10\u00a0mg/kg per dose with shortest interval of 4\u00a0h and ibuprofen 10\u00a0mg/kg per dose with shortest interval of 6\u00a0h and the shortest interval between acetaminophen and ibuprofen \u22652\u00a0h; n\u00a0=\u00a0158), (2) acetaminophen monotherapy (10\u00a0mg/kg per dose with shortest interval of 4\u00a0h; n\u00a0=\u00a0158), or (3) ibuprofen monotherapy (10\u00a0mg/kg per dose with shortest interval of 6\u00a0h; n\u00a0=\u00a0158). The mean Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist (NCCPC) score was measured every 4\u00a0h, and axillary temperatures were measured every 2\u00a0h.",
        "In total, 471 children were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. No significant clinical or statistical difference was found in mean NCCPC score or temperature during the 24-h treatment period in all febrile children across the three groups. Although the proportion of children with refractory fever for 4\u00a0h and 6 h was significantly lower in the alternating group than in the monotherapy groups (4 h: 11.54% vs. 26.58% vs. 21.66%, respectively [p\u00a0=\u00a00.003]; 6 h: 3.85% vs. 10.13% vs. 17.83%, respectively [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]), the mean NCCPC score of children with refractory fever for 4 or 6\u00a0h was not lower than those in either of the monotherapy groups. The number of patients who developed persistent high body temperature was consistent across all study groups.",
        "Alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen can reduce the proportion of children with refractory fever, but if one cycle of alternating therapy cannot reduce febrile distress as defined by NCCPC score, two or more cycles of alternating therapy may have minimal to no clinical efficacy in some cases. The trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR-TRC-13003440 and the WHO Registry Network as U1111-1146-6714."
