        "The management of febrile conditions (differential diagnosis, therapy, prevention, resources) involves problems the rehabilitation of spinal cord injured patients has to face every day. Febrile periods accompany the entire life of the tetra or paraplegics from the acute traumatological stage through the rehabilitation till almost the end of their lives. It is reasonable to suspect urogenital infections in the first place, knowing the disorders of sphincter functions and the necessity of catheterisation. The other group of pathologies includes the bedsores and even into joints, may be the sources of septicaemia. They interfere with mobilisation and cause deterioration in the quality of life even in later years. The information and care provided by the family doctor are highly important in this respect. Although infrequently there may be postoperative complications in the background of the fevers, yet especially in tetraplegics respiratory complications are more common and can be correlated with the restrictive ventilation and trachea cannula implantation. Author presents a one-year material in the light of published evidence, pointing out the health professional and even more far reaching difficulties, with special reference to the large numbers and avoidability of nosocomial infections. Attention is called to the thoroughness and commitment the specialist in medical rehabilitation has to exercise in connection with individual, special cases in his or her actions."
