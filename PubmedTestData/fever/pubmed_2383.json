        "The purpose of this study was to investigate caretakers' knowledge of the implications of fever, the appropriate method of fever management, and the effectiveness of an educational intervention directed toward improving caretakers' ability to manage their child's fever.",
        "A descriptive, comparative study was conducted with a convenience sample of 86 caretakers. Follow-up data were obtained for 50 caretakers. Data were collected with an investigator-developed open-ended questionnaire.",
        "A fever of 104 degrees F was considered to be harmful by 31 subjects. However, fever as low as 100 degrees F was perceived to be harmful by eight subjects. Administration of acetaminophen was the most frequent method of treatment (84 [98%] of 86). No significant improvement in caretaker knowledge in terms of the level of fever at which to administer medication was demonstrated (chi-squared analysis, .012; df, 1; p = 0.91). Accuracy of antipyretic medication dosage was improved (chi-squared analysis, 13.13; df, 6; p = 0.04).",
        "Caretakers continue to perceive even marginal fevers can cause harm. Improvement was noted in dose accuracy after the intervention. The lack of significant improvement in caretaker knowledge regarding some aspects of fever management after the educational intervention suggests that more than a one-time educational intervention is required."
