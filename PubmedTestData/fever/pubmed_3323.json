      "AbstractText": [
        "This study investigated parental knowledge, attitudes and practices towards fever in preschool children to help address gaps in public health and provide information with the aim of supporting clinical reports for parental education.",
        "A cross-sectional study design was used to explore parental experiences with fever.",
        "Participants were recruited randomly from schools all over Lebanon targeting the preschool divisions.",
        "Parents of children aged 5 years or less.",
        "An electronic self-administered questionnaire was sent to the parents through the schools' emails and e-learning mobile applications.",
        "The primary outcome measure was to assess parental knowledge about the precise definition of fever, correct use of medications and to evaluate the impact of sociodemographic factors on this knowledge. The secondary outcome measures were to assess parental attitudes and practices of fever management, sources of information and reasons to seek primary medical attention.",
        "A total of 733 parents were included in the study. Only 44% identified fever correctly according to the recognised definition by international guidelines. A significant association between parents' knowledge of antibiotics and years of parenting experience was found (adjusted OR, ORa=4.23, 95%\u2009CI 1.41 to 12.68, p=0.01). Other sociodemographic factors that were significantly associated with parents' knowledge of antibiotics were age (ORa=3.42, 95%\u2009CI 1.09 to 10.73, p=0.036) and education level (ORa=7.99, 95%\u2009CI 3.71 to 17.23, p<0.001). Greater than 75% usually give their children antipyretics without consulting a doctor. Approximately one-quarter of parents (26.3%) consulted different doctors at the same time, of which more than half (58.4%) had received different medical information.",
        "This research determines deficiencies in parents' knowledge of fever with some malpractices in its management particularly regarding antipyretic use. It provides insight for healthcare providers to empower parental experiences by offering the necessary information to enhance general outcomes of febrile sickness."
