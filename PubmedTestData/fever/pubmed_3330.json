        "The aim of this study was to determine the causes of fever among cancer patients.",
        "All febrile cancer patients were followed up prospectively. Clinical, microbiological and radiological documentations were performed. Aetiologies of fever, type of tumour, site of infection, type of microorganism and outcome were assessed and compared between neutropenics and non-neutropenics.",
        "Four hundred and seventy-seven episodes were evaluated. Infection, non-infectious causes and fever of unknown origin represented 67, 23 and 10%, respectively. The respiratory tract is the most frequently involved site in infection (29%), and in microbiologically documented infections, Gram-negative bacilli were predominant. The tumour itself (27%) or an invasive procedure (17%) were the main causes of non-infectious febrile episodes. Mortality from infection was higher among non-neutropenic (11.1%) than neutropenic patients (4.3%).",
        "Fever in cancer patients remains a challenge, and the differentiation between infectious and non-infectious causes at onset of fever is very difficult. Despite all the prophylactic measures, infection is still the principal cause. However, the infection-related mortality is low either in neutropenic or non-neutropenic patients."
