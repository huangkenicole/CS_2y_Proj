        "In acute viral infections with high fever a reduction of body temperature by the action of antithermics effects a brief clinical improvement but shortly the temperature rises again to the levels higher than previously. This indicates an aggravation of the disease. The consequent hyperthermia can be controlled while synchronously the immunologically favorable effect of fever on the activation of the defense reaction of the diseased organism is preserved; this is achieved by a special procedure regulates high febrility. This consists firstly, of lowering all body temperatures above 39 degrees C (measured in the axilla), by the application of lukewarm water compresses around the neck or bathing in the water at 30 degrees C until body temperature is reduced to 38.5 degrees C, after which the bath should be discontinued and the patient left unclothed, lightly covered, at a body T of 38.5-39 degrees C; if the T rises again, the procedure is repeated. The procedure described regulates high fever, promotes clinical improvement and contributes to a favorable outcome of the disease."
