      "AbstractText": [
        "Human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous virus but can lead to deleterious clinical manifestations due to its predilection for the pediatric central nervous system. Despite significant literature describing its common clinical course, it is rarely considered as a causative agent in CSF pleocytosis in the setting of craniotomy and external ventricular drainage device. Identification of a primary HHV-6 infection allowed for timely treatment with an antiviral agent along with earlier discontinuation of antibiotic regimen and expedited placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.",
        "A two-year-old girl presented with 3 months of progressive gait disturbance and intranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Following craniotomy for removal of 4th ventricular pilocytic astrocytoma and decompression of hydrocephalus, she suffered a prolonged clinical course due to persistent fevers and worsening CSF leukocytosis despite multiple antibiotic regimens. The patient was admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and isolated with her parents in the intensive care unit with strict infection control measures. FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (FAME) panel ultimately detected HHV-6. Clinical confirmation of HHV-6-induced meningitis was proposed given improvement in CSF leukocytosis and fever reduction following the initiation of antiviral medications. Pathologic analysis of brain tumor tissue failed to show HHV-6 genome positivity, suggesting a primary peripheral etiology of infection.",
        "Here, we present the first known case of HHV-6 infection detected by FAME following intracranial tumor resection. We propose a modified algorithm for persistent fever of unknown origin which may decrease symptomatic sequelae, minimize additional procedures, and shorten length of ICU stay."
