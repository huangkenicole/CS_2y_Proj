        "The Arctic Sun 5000 system (Bard Medical, Covington, GA) and Arctic Gel Hydrogel pads were used for the purposes of the study. Data collected included demographics, indication of therapy, patient's body temperature, target temperature, time-to-target temperature, duration of therapy, and need to start or increase sedation and/or muscle relaxants.",
        "A total of 16 patients were included, of whom 68.8% were male; mean age was 4.7 years. The most frequent indication was fever associated with hemodynamic instability (62.5%). The target temperature was normothermia (36 or 36.5\u00b0C) in 81% of cases. Mean baseline body temperature was 37.6\u00b0C (\u00b1 1.2\u00b0C), and 50% of patients had fever (> 38\u00b0C). The mean speed of cooling was 1.2\u00b0C/hr (\u00b1 1\u00b0C/hr). Mean time to target temperature was 118 minutes (\u00b1 98.8\u2009min). Mean duration of therapy was 68.7 hours (\u00b1 58.3\u2009hr). Two patients had fever related to device disconnection during the treatment. At the start of the therapy, 15 patients were receiving sedative and analgesic drugs, and four received muscle relaxants. A patient required increased sedation, whereas another patient needed to start muscle relaxants. One of the patients developed a skin lesion in the axilla, no other adverse events were registered.",
        "Despite the small sample size, the results of the study showed that target temperature management by the servo-controlled gel pad system in critically ill pediatric patients was effective in achieving satisfactory temperature control and it was well-tolerated."
