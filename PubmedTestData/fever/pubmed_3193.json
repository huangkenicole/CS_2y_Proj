        "The resource utilization and cost of 51 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children with leukemia and lymphomas who were admitted to the Pediatric Oncology Institute (GRAAC) of the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo were analyzed. Patients aged 60 days to 21 years with confirmed diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgki\u0144s disease who presented axillary temperature above 38 degrees C at least once episode, or between 37.5 degrees C and 38 degrees C on three occasions during a 24-h period, neutrophil count below 500/mm(3), or between 500/mm(3)and 1,000/mm(3) but expected to fall below 500/mm(3) were included in the study. The patients' ages varied between 1 and 15.6 years, and 67% of the patients were male. The median cost per treated episode was US dollars 2,660 (2,039). Hospitalization costs accounted for 62% of the total cost of the treatment, antibacterials accounting for 23%. Episodes in patients with documented infections had a higher median direct cost than episodes in patients with fever of unknown origin (P=0.018). There was a trend for a higher median direct cost in episodes among patients with a worse prognostic factor, such as type of underlying disease, presence of documented infection, and longer duration of neutropenia. This is the first study to evaluate the economics of febrile neutropenia episodes in Brazil, and serves as a basis for resource utilization and costs incurred in the treatment of such patients in this country."
