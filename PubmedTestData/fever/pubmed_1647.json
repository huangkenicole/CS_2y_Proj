        "The most serious adverse event in cancer patients who receive anti-neoplastic agents is febrile neutropenia(FN). The clinical guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with FN was published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. However, the dosage and administration of antimicrobial agents are not completely adapted for Japanese insurance coverage. The Japanese Society of Medical Oncology therefore decided to develop a clinical guideline for the management of FN in Japanese patients. In this study, we provide a general description of the guideline. According to the guideline, fever is defined as a single axillary temperature of B37. 5\u00b0C(or an oral temperature of B38\u00b0C)and neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of <500/mL or <1, 000/mL if the count is expected to decrease to <500/mL within the next 48 h. In patients who develop FN, empirical anti-pseudomonal b-lactam agent monotherapy should be administered promptly at the onset of fever. Antibiotic therapy should continue until patients become afebrile and their neutrophil counts recover to B500/mL. If fever persists for 4-7 days under antibiotic therapy in high-risk patients, empirical antifungal therapy should be considered. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk patients with an anticipated risk of FN of B20%."
