        "This study aimed to evaluate the global clinical practice guidelines on fever in children. We also aimed to select a guideline with good methodology and reporting quality to provide scientific reference for diagnosis and treatment of fever in children.",
        "The Chinese and English databases Embase, PubMed, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, clinical guides, and the website of the Department of Public Health Administration were retrieved up to January 2020. The clinical practice guidelines on fever in children were included. The AGREE II instrument and Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare statement were used to evaluate the methodology and reporting quality of the guidelines.",
        "Eight clinical guidelines for fever in children were included. Methodological quality assessment showed that the recommendation level of ISP, South Africa, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, China, and American College of Emergency Physicians were grade B (recommended with modification), while that of American Academy of Pediatrics, New South Wales, and South Australia was grade C recommendation (not recommended). No grade A recommendation guideline was found. The reporting quality from higher to lower was National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Chinese guideline, American College of Emergency Physicians, ISP, South Africa, New South Wales, South Australia, and American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline recommendations were similar in various countries, but they were slightly different in various aspects, including body temperature measurement and the timing of drug administration.",
        "There are limitations in the methodology and reporting quality of all eight global guidelines on fever in children. For future development of these guidelines, attention should be paid to improving applicability of the guidelines in terms of methodology. Additionally, the principles and explanations for formation of recommendations should be described, as well as the limitations of the reporting guideline in detail in terms of the reporting quality. Treatments of fever in children are similar in different countries, but there are still differences that require further research."
