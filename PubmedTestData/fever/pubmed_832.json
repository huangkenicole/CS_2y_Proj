        "Thermal reactions were investigated in rabbits: blood plasma donors running on treadmill to exhaustion and resting blood plasma recipients. Blood plasma was infused in the ear's vein and in the third brain ventricle cavity. Small elevation of body cork temperature (0.3-0.4 degree C) with the latent period 40-50 min was found on plasma infusion in the ear's vein of recipient. Plasma perfusion through the third brain ventricle of the recipient caused two peaks of nearly the same amplitude (0.8-1.0 degrees C) in body core temperature. The second peak, which was registered in 12-15 min after the perfusion began, was induced, as the authors suggest, by the accumulation of \"work factor\" of thermoregulation in donor's plasma during muscular work. Humoral regulation of working hyperthermia is discussed."
