        "Fever is a common symptom in children. Some children may present to their primary care physician with undifferentiated fever; that is, fever for which there is no obvious source from the history or physical examination. Undifferentiated fevers may be prolonged or recurrent. Distinguishing between the two is helpful for narrowing the differential diagnosis, which can be broad and include infections and inflammatory diseases and, rarely, malignancies and autoinflammatory disorders. The evaluation of such children requires a step-wise approach. Taking a detailed history, performing a thorough physical examination, and reviewing a fever and symptom diary is crucial in recognizing clues that may ultimately lead to a diagnosis. Some children who look good and whose fever disappears may never have a diagnosis, whereas referral to a specialist may be prudent for others. [Pediatr Ann. 2018;47(9):e347-e353.]."
