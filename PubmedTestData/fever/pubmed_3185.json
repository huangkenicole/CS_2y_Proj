        "Body temperature monitoring in most healthcare institutions is limited to checking the presence or absence of fever. Our present study evaluated the 24h continuous tympanic temperature pattern in patients with fever in order to detect typical patterns seen in tuberculosis (TB). This observational study was conducted on 81 undifferentiated fever patients whose recordings were stored using the TherCom device. Unique temperature patterns were analysed and compared. TB patients exhibited a unique temperature pattern, namely a slow temperature elevation followed by slow temperature fall seen in 78.5% (22/28) compared to 24.52% (13/53) of non-TB patients. Recognition of this pattern may therefore be useful as a valuable diagnostic aid in the early diagnosis of TB."
