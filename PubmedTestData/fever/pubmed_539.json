        "Nurses play a vital role in the care of neurocritical patients. Fever is a common and dangerous occurrence, and there is a substantial lack of consistency in how to maintain normothermia in these patients. We present five cases in which patients were confirmed to have neurogenic fever (NF) and the documented interventions. In all five cases, temperature and interventions were not documented consistently, making it difficult to assess how nurses acted to avoid hyperthermia in these patients. Additional research is needed to determine interventions, processes, procedures, and documentation of NF in neurocritical patients."
