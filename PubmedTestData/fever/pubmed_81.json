        "<i>Objective:</i> Continuous temperature monitoring in high-risk patients can enable healthcare providers to remotely track patients' temperatures, promptly detect fevers and timely intervene to improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temperature monitor (Verily Patch) can reliably estimate body temperature and early detect fevers in an outpatient setting in patients at a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) who recently underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). <i>Methods:</i> 86 patients at a high risk for FN were prospectively enrolled at Mayo Clinic, MN. Patients wore the device in their axilla region for 7 days post ASCT and recorded self-measured oral temperatures every 3 hours. Patients were also followed using clinical standard-of-care procedures with daily oral temperature assessment. The clinic- and patient-assessed oral temperatures were used to develop and evaluate Verily Patch's body temperature and early fever detection algorithms using a K-fold cross-validation approach. <i>Results:</i> The Verily Patch reliably measured body temperatures with an error of 0.35 \u00b1 0.88\u00b0F in comparison to clinic- and patient-assessed oral temperatures. The sensitivity and specificity of the patch in detecting clinic-assessed fever episodes was 90.2% and 87.8%. The patch detected 14.3 times the number of clinic-assessed fever episodes with a median lead time of 4.3 hours. <i>Conclusion:</i> Patient self-monitoring of temperature and fever incidents suffers from low accuracy and is impractical for extended periods of time. Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device (such as Verily Patch) has the potential to overcome these challenges resulting in better patient clinical outcomes and more cost-effective care."
