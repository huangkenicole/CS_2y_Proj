        "Records from 101 dogs presented for investigation of unexplained pyrexia were reviewed. The most common diagnosis was immune-mediated disease (22 per cent of cases), with immune-mediated polyarthritis accounting for 20 per cent of all diagnoses. The frequency of positive results obtained in investigative tests was also assessed. Cytological and radiological examinations provided a high diagnostic success rate, although routine haematology and plasma biochemistry were also useful screening tests. On the basis of these results it is suggested that, in the investigation of unexplained pyrexia, a diagnosis of immune-mediated polyarthritis should be excluded before less common diagnoses are considered."
