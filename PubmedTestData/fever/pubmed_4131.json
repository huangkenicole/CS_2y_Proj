        "We report a retrospective analysis of 75 children with hepatic portoenterostomies hospitalized because of fever. Bacterial cholangitis was the most commonly defined cause of fever within 3 months of surgery. Pneumonia and upper respiratory infections were more common 3 months to 2 years following the procedure; however, cholangitis continued to occur during this time period. Twenty percent of hospitalizations were associated with bacteremia or fungemia. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen isolated from the blood. Three children with presumed cholangitis continued to have fever until effective antipseudomonal antibiotic coverage was implemented. The findings in this study lead to the following suggestions: vaccinate all children with pneumococcal vaccine at 2 years of age; a chest radiograph and dental evaluation should be obtained when evaluating the febrile child; empiric treatment for possible cholangitis should include an antipseudomonal penicillin derivative with an aminoglycoside; and if signs of peritonitis are present antibiotic treatment should also include antimicrobials effective against Haemophilus influenzae."
