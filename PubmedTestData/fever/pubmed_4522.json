        "A 51-year old Caucasian male was admitted to the hospital with a history of breathlessness of one month duration. Prior to this he had been well. He complained that the shortness of breath had worsened over the previous 10 days and was associated with fatigue and fever. The antibiotics from his GP did not relieve his symptoms. He denied any cough, sputum or haemoptysis."
