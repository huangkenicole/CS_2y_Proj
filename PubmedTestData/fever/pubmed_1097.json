        "Maternal intra-partum fever commonly complicates the process of labour. Its occurrence is often regarded as being synonymous with the presence of chorioamnionitis. This inevitably results in the administration of antibiotics to the affected mother. Review of the literature however suggests that this approach is not always appropriate. Non-infective causes of this condition that are often overlooked include the use of epidural analgesia for pain relief, normal thermal physiological changes in women not using any form of analgesia and delivery in an overheated room. Women with certain risk factors such as nulliparity and a long latent phase of labour are also more prone to developing maternal intra-partum fever. Irrespective of its aetiology, maternal intra-partum fever carries risks both for the mother and her unborn child. Putting more thought into the care of these patients will go a long way in reducing the maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with this complication."
