        "Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the hypothalamus is a principal mediator of the febrile response. However, the role of organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1/<i>SLCO2A1</i>), a prostaglandin transporter, in facilitating this response is unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of <i>Slco2a1</i> deficiency on the body core temperature (Tc) and on the PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (<i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>) and CSF (<i>C</i><sub>csf</sub>) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 \u03bcg/kg, i.p.)-treated mice of both sexes. <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not develop a febrile response. <i>C</i><sub>csf</sub> was increased in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and <i>C</i><sub>csf</sub> of <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice was well maintained at 5 h after LPS injection (1160 pg/ml) compared with <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (316 pg/ml). A microdialysis study revealed that <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> peaked at 2 h after LPS injection in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (841 pg/ml), whereas the increase in <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> was negligible in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The PGE<sub>2</sub> plasma concentration in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (201 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that in <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice (54 pg/ml) at 1 h after LPS injection, whereas the two groups showed similar PGE<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the hypothalamus. Strong Oatp2a1 immunoreactivity was observed in F4/80-positive microglia and perivascular cells and in brain capillary endothelial cells. The changes in Tc and <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> seen in LPS-injected <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice were partially attenuated in monocyte-/macrophage-specific <i>Slco2a1</i><sup>-/-</sup> (<i>Slco2a1</i><sup>Fl/Fl</sup>/<i>LysM</i><sup>Cre/+</sup>) mice. Thus, OATP2A1 facilitates the LPS-induced febrile response by maintaining a high level of <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>, possibly by regulating PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from F4/80-positive glial cells and/or facilitating PGE<sub>2</sub> transport across the blood-brain barrier. These findings suggest that OATP2A1 is a useful therapeutic target for neuroinflammation.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fever is a physiological response caused by pyrogen-induced release of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the hypothalamus, which plays a central role in regulating the set-point of body temperature. However, it is unclear whether the prostaglandin transporter OATP2A1/<i>SLCO2A1</i> is involved in this response. We show here that LPS-induced fever is associated with increased PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in hypothalamus interstitial fluid (<i>C</i><sub>isf</sub>), but not in CSF (<i>C</i><sub>csf</sub>), by means of a microdialysis study in global <i>Slco2a1</i>-knock-out mice and monocyte-/macrophage-specific <i>Slco2a1</i>-knock-out mice. The results suggest that OATP2A1 serves as a regulator of <i>C</i><sub>isf</sub> in F4/80-positive glial cells. OATP2A1 was detected immunohistochemically in brain capillary endothelial cells and, therefore, may also play a role in PGE<sub>2</sub> transport across the blood-brain barrier."
