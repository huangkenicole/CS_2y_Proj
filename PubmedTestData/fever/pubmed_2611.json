        "Fever during chemotherapy is a common and potentially severe complication being increasingly evaluated in emergency departments to minimize morbidity and mortality. Streamlining triage of these patients may improve health outcomes and wait times in the health care system.",
        "A retrospective chart review of febrile patients undergoing chemotherapy was conducted at a local emergency department to assess the impact of nurse-initiated protocols on wait times.",
        "We identified 315 patients undergoing current chemotherapy presenting with fever. Of these, 140 (44%) and 87 (28%) were initiated on the sepsis and febrile neutropenia nurse-initiated protocols, respectively. In total, 197 (63%) were admitted. The febrile neutropenia protocol had a shorter wait time from triage to disposition than the sepsis protocol (403\u00a0minutes [SD\u00a0= 23] vs 329\u00a0minutes [SD\u00a0= 19], t = 1.71, P\u00a0= 0.01). Furthermore, the febrile neutropenia protocol demonstrated shorter times from both triage to lab results reported, in addition to the physician initial assessment in the admitted patient subgroup.",
        "Decreased wait times from triage associated with the use of a febrile neutropenia protocol could be accounted for by a lower number of lab results required through this protocol in addition to shorter physician assessment times in the admitted population. This study shows that nurse-initiated protocols may influence door-to-antibiotic time for patients undergoing chemotherapy. By having a targeted protocol for the cancer population, health care centers may be able to demonstrate decreased health care expenditure and increased resource availability. Furthermore, as the current population of patients undergoing chemotherapy is at a high risk for neutropenia, prompt management is crucial to minimize mortality."
