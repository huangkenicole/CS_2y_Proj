        "Multiple congenital abnormalities (MCAs) represent the most severe category of structural birth defects; therefore, we decided to evaluate the possible etiological factors for MCAs.",
        "The population-based large data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities (1980-1996) was evaluated.",
        "We compared the data of 1,349 cases with MCAs, 2,405 matched population controls without any defect, and 21,494 malformed controls with isolated congenital abnormalities. An association was found between a higher risk for MCAs and high fever-related influenza, common cold with secondary complications, tonsillitis, and recurrent orofacial herpes (adjusted ORs with 95% CIs: 2.3, 1.8-2.9). However, the risk for MCAs was reduced by antifever drug therapy (adjusted OR with 95% CI: 1.6, 0.9-2.9).",
        "An association was found between high fever-related maternal diseases and a higher risk for MCAs; however, a certain portion of these MCAs is preventable by antifever therapy."
