        "A 57-year-old man was admitted for 1\u00a0month of accelerating hemoptysis and hematemesis. Two weeks earlier, he first presented with fevers and hemoptysis of 2\u00a0weeks' duration and was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia treated with 5\u00a0days of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He improved and was discharged, but his hemoptysis recurred 1\u00a0day after discharge and progressed over 9\u00a0days, leading to the present admission. He endorsed an 5-kg weight loss, daily fevers up to 39.4\u00b0C, and night sweats since discharge. His medical history was significant for peptic ulcer disease complicated by a perforated gastric ulcer 30 years ago, type 2 diabetes, and Barrett esophagus with recent normal upper endoscopy. The patient had coarctation of the aorta repaired 35 years ago. The patient takes aspirin, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. He emigrated from Mexico 10 years before presentation and lives in Texas with his family. He returns to Mexico several times per year, most recently 2\u00a0days before admission. He works at a supermarket. He does not smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. He denied sick contacts, pets, or incarceration."
