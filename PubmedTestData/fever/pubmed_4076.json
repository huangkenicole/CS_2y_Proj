        "In the pediatric primary care setting, well-child visits constitute over 50% of all encounters, treating over 24 million children annually. Anticipatory guidance topics vary based on different ages, but immunizations are a focal point of all well-child visits. This article addresses the prophylactic use of antipyretic agents with the administration of immunizations as a potential reason of concern.",
        "A literature review of the use of antipyretic agents in\u00a0conjunction with immunizations and the effectiveness of treatment was performed.",
        "Based on several studies, the standard recommendation of administering antipyretic agents with immunization administration was a routine. Twenty years later, the scientific evidence was questioned. A pivotal study questioned these standards, noting no benefit and potential decreased immune response.",
        "Although the prophylactic use of antipyretics has been a standard in pediatrics, the lack of scientific support in the reduction of adverse effects of the vaccinations and the possibility of decreased immune response warrants further research."
