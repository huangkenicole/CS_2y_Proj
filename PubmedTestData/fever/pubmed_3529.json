        "To identify risk factors for febrile complications after suction curettage abortion, the authors analyzed the data of 26,332 women who underwent suction curettage abortion at 5 participating centers in the Joint Program for the Study of Abortion, Part III, from 1975-76. Febrile morbidity was defined as an oral temperature of greater than 38 degrees Centigrade for 2 days or longer. The febrile morbidity rate was 0.34/100 abortions. A multivariate analysis was performed using a linear logistic regression model. Prophylactic antibiotics proved to be the most protective factor, reducing the rate of febrile complications to about 1/3 that of women who received no prophylactic antibiotics (relative risk 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.70). Patients who had had 1 or more previous births also had a significantly lower risk of febrile morbidity (relative risk 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.88). Other factors did not significantly affect the febrile complication rate."

We performed a multivariate analysis using a linear logistic regression model. Prophylactic antibiotics proved to be the most protective factor, reducing the rate of febrile complications to about one third that of women who received no prophylactic antibiotics (relative risk 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.70).
