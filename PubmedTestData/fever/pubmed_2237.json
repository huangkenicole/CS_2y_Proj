        "The aim of this evidence implementation project was to integrate the best available evidence on non-pharmacological fever and febrile symptom management into nursing practice at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, China.",
        "Fever is challenging for patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Guidelines assert that successful non-pharmacological fever management should be the standard of care. To introduce evidence into clinical practice, the Department of Infectious Disease of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre implemented a best practice project.",
        "This evidence implementation project utilized the Joanna Briggs Institute Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System (JBI PACES) and Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) audit and feedback tool. Seven audit criteria were established on the best available evidence. The project was divided into three phases and conducted over five months.",
        "Follow-up audits showed significant improvements. The most significant improvements in compliance occurred in the assessment of suitability of external cooling methods (100%), education for nurses (100%) and patients (100%), and monitoring (93%). A moderate increase was noted in the assessment of fluid intake and output volume (73%). A small increase of 30% in compliance was found in hydration support. No changes in compliance were found in assessment of the cause of fever in the HIV-positive population.",
        "This project led to various changes in the unit including a formal assessment of intake and output volume for PLWHs with chronic fever, a formal assessment of some factors related to the \"cause of fever\", tailored education programs and materials for both nurses and patients. All these changes are now part of routine nursing practice. Further audits will need to be carried out to sustain practice behavior change and monitor areas for further improvements."
