        "Questionnaires were used to survey 95 pediatric house officers in order to determine their reasons and methods for treating fever, as well as their knowledge of fever physiology. The reasons given for treating fever were to make the child comfortable (99%), to prevent seizures (63%), and to satisfy parents (44%). The average temperature at which antipyretic medication was started was 38.6 +/- 0.3 C. Alternating doses of aspirin and acetaminophen were used by 53 per cent, and sponging was recommended by 76 per cent of the residents. The average temperature at which sponging was started was 39.5 +/- 0.6 C. The percentage of house officers who use sponging and/or alternating doses of antipyretics differed greatly from hospital to hospital. Sixty-one per cent of the residents felt that fever is a defense mechanism which does not require treatment. Despite this belief, the majority of these residents use vigorous means to lower fever in children."
