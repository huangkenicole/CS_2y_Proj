        "Fever and neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of pediatric cancer treatment, but hospital utilization patterns for this condition are not well described.",
        "Data were analyzed from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), an all-payer US hospital database, for 2009. Pediatric FN patients were identified using: age \u226419 years, urgent or emergent admit type, non-transferred, and a combination of ICD-9-CM codes for fever and neutropenia. Sampling weights were used to permit national inferences.",
        "Pediatric cancer patients accounted for 1.5 % of pediatric hospital discharges in 2009 (n = 110,967), with 10.1 % of cancer-related discharges meeting FN criteria (n = 11,261). Two-fifths of FN discharges had a \"short length of stay\" (SLOS) of \u22643 days, which accounted for approximately $65.5 million in hospital charges. Upper respiratory infection (6.0 %) and acute otitis media (AOM) (3.7 %) were the most common infections associated with SLOS. Factors significantly associated with SLOS included living in the Midwest region (OR = 1.65, 1.22-2.24) or West region (OR 1.54, 1.11-2.14) versus Northeast, having a diagnosis of AOM (OR = 1.39, 1.03-1.87) or viral infection (OR = 1.63, 1.18-2.25) versus those without those comorbidities, and having a soft tissue sarcoma (OR = 1.47, 1.05-2.04), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 2.33, 1.62-3.35), or an ovarian/testicular tumor (OR = 1.76, 1.05-2.95) compared with patients without these diagnoses.",
        "FN represents a common precipitant for hospitalizations among pediatric cancer patients. SLOS admissions are rarely associated with serious infections, but contribute substantially to the burden of hospitalization for pediatric FN."
