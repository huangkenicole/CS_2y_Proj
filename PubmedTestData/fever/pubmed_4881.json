      "AbstractText": [
        "A 22-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with an ecstasy (MDMA) intoxication which was accompanied by hyperthermia. The patient developed rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalaemia, hypoglycaemia and acidosis, followed by multiple organ failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebral oedema. Despite maximal symptomatic treatment, the patient died after 4 days. MDMA is a serotonin agonist but also has noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects. It is a popular drug in the Netherlands among young people and is often wrongly considered to be safe. The occurrence of serious side effects is unpredictable and can have fatal consequences. Especially hyperthermia as a side effect of MDMA is a potentially life-threatening complication. The treatment is mainly symptomatic and consists of cooling, fluids, treatment of electrolyte disturbances, and support for respiration and circulation. The usefulness of dantrolene in the treatment of MDMA-induced hyperthermia is controversial, but for now it is still recommended."
