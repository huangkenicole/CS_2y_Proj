        "Ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles were combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as a means to achieve mild hyperthermia at reduced power levels.",
        "MRgFUS hyperthermia (42\u00b0C for 20\u2009min) was evaluated in rabbit thigh muscle or Vx2 tumors using infusions of microbubbles (Definity, 20 \u00b5L/kg) or saline (sham) administered over 5\u2009min. The impact of treatments on drug uptake was assessed with liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, 2.5\u2009mg/kg). Applied power levels before and after the injection of microbubbles or saline were compared, and drug uptake was evaluated with fluorometry of tissues harvested 24\u2009hr post-treatment.",
        "MRgFUS hyperthermia in muscle and tumors resulted in accurate temperature control (mean =42.0\u00b0C, root mean square error (RMSE)\u2009=\u20090.3\u00b0C). The power dropped significantly following the injection of microbubbles in muscle and tumors compared to exposures without microbubbles (-21.9%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5% vs -5.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8%, p\u2009=\u2009.009 in muscle; -33.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9% vs -3.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2%, p\u2009<\u2009.001 in tumors). Cavitation monitoring indicated emission of subharmonic, ultraharmonic, and elevated levels of fourth to sixth harmonic frequencies following microbubble injection. The drug delivery was elevated significantly in muscle with the use of microbubble-assisted relative to conventional heating (0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009ng/mg vs 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009ng/mg, p\u2009=\u2009.05), whereas in tumors similar levels were found (11\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009ng/mg vs 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009ng/mg, p\u2009=\u2009.13).",
        "The finding that microbubbles reduce the applied power requirements for hyperthermia has considerable clinical implications. The elevated levels of drug found in muscle but not tumor tissue suggest a complex interplay between the heating effects of microbubbles with those of enhanced permeabilization and possible vascular damage."
