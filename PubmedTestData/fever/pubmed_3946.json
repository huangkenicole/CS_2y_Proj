        "The purpose of the present study was to examine the development of tolerance to three structurally dissimilar pyrogens, i.e., lipopolysaccharide (LPS), muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in rabbits. The possibility of pyrogenic cross-tolerance among these agents has also been studied. It was observed that repeated injection of sublethal doses of LPS and MDP was connected with the changing of biphasic fever to monophasic. The consequence of this was a drop in the fever index. In contrast to LPS and MDP, the repeated administration of poly I:C did not result in such changes. Successive injections of this pyrogen always evoked biphasic fever. We also demonstrated that pyrogenic cross-tolerance between LPS and MDP did not occur. The cross-tolerance between LPS and MDP did not occur. The cross-tolerance among pyrogens was possible if they originated from the same class, for example endotoxin from Salmonella abortus eq. and endotoxin from Escherichia coli."
