        "To study the possibility that responses of fever and discharge of neurons in PVN to intraperitoneal administration of LPS are mediated by vagal afferents.",
        "Rectal temperature of rat was detected by digital temperature detecting instrument. Glass micropipette placed in PVN was used to record unit discharges of neurons in it, before and after LPS was injected into PVN in normal rats and vagotomy rats.",
        "The rectal temperature change value in vagotomy LPS group was significantly decreased compared with that in sham LPS group, and there was striking difference between them (P < 0.05). The discharges of neurons in PVN was increased in the normal rat in response to LPS. The discharges of neurons in PVN had no significant change in the vagotomy rats in response to LPS.",
        "The results indicate that vagus nerve may be one of the pathways of peripheral LPS signal communicating to CNS."
