        "The human body has a perfect thermoregulatory system to meet the needs of normal life activities. The central regulation of body temperature is mainly explained by the theory of \"setting point (setpoint, SP)\". Fever is a positive but nonspecific response of the body to infections and other pyrogens, which causes immune cells to release cytokines, leading to a brain protein-mediated rise in body temperature. Cytokines can be roughly divided into 2 categories: proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 are proinflammatory cytokines, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 are anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-2 is a cytokine that can both activate and inhibit immunity. IL-8 is a neutrophil chemotactic factor, and IFN is a cytokine that plays a key role in the proper induction and maintenance of innate and acquired immunity. This article reviews the pathophysiological characteristics of fever and the cytokines related to fever (IL-2, 4, 6, 8, 10, IFN, TNF, <i>etc.</i>)."
