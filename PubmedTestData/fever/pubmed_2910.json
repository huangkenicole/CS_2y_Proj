        "The purpose of this study was to determine whether ingestion of a small bolus of ice slurry (1.25 g kg(-1)) could attenuate the reduction in maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) torque output during a 2-min sustained task following exercise-induced hyperthermia. On two separate occasions, 10 males (age: 24 \u00b1 3 years, .VO(2peak): 49.8 \u00b1 4.7 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) ran to exhaustion at their first ventilatory threshold in a hot environment (34.1 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C, 49.5 \u00b1 3.6% RH). Prior to and after exercise, subjects performed a 2-min sustained MVC of the right elbow flexors in a thermoneutral environment (24.6 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C, 37.2 \u00b1 4.5% RH). The post exercise MVC was performed immediately following the ingestion of either 1.25 g kg(-1) of ice slurry (-1\u00b0C; ICE) or warm fluid (40\u00b0C; CON), in a counterbalanced and randomised order. Run time to exhaustion (42.4 \u00b1 9.5 vs. 41.7 \u00b1 8.7 min; p = 0.530), and rectal (39.08 \u00b1 0.30 vs. 39.08 \u00b1 0.30\u00b0C; p = 0.934) and skin temperatures (35.26 \u00b1 0.65 vs. 35.28 \u00b1 0.67\u00b0C; p = 0.922) and heart rate (189 \u00b1 5 vs. 189 \u00b1 6 beats min(-1); p = 0.830) at the end of the run were similar between trials. Torque output during the post-exercise 2-min sustained MVC was significantly higher (p = 0.001) following ICE (30.75 \u00b1 16.40 Nm) compared with CON (28.69 \u00b1 14.88 Nm). These results suggest that ice slurry ingestion attenuated the effects of exercise-induced hyperthermia on MVC, possibly via internal thermoreceptive and/or temperature-related sensory mechanisms."
