        "To date, very few studies have addressed nonneutropenic fever (NNF) in children with cancer, and there are no consensus guidelines. This scoping review aims to describe the rate of bacteremia, risk factors for infection and management, and outcomes of NNF in this population. Across 15 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a04106 episodes), the pooled-average bacteremia rate was 8.2%, and risk factors included tunneled external central venous catheter, clinical instability, and higher temperature. In two studies, antibiotics were successfully withheld in a subset of low-risk patients. Overall outcomes of NNF appear favorable; however, further research is required to determine its true clinical and economic impact."
