        "To determine the appropriateness of current postpartum antibiotic use in clinical practice.",
        "Medical records were reviewed for all patients delivering in a 3-month period who received postpartum antibiotics during the delivery hospitalization. Subjects were excluded if they received a single postpartum antibiotic dose as part of a mitral valve prolapse prophylaxis protocol, or if they received no more than one postpartum antibiotic dose for surgical prophylaxis. Characteristics of postpartum antibiotic use were abstracted.",
        "Two hundred and eleven of 1537 (14%) delivering patients met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-four (35%) delivered vaginally and 137 (65%) delivered by Cesarean section. Postpartum fevers were found in 40 (54%) of vaginal delivery cases and 80 (58%) of women delivering by Cesarean section who received postpartum antibiotics (p = 0.54). For vaginal deliveries there were no differences in the duration of antibiotic use or number of antibiotic doses based on fever status. For Cesarean deliveries, a fever was associated with more antibiotic doses and a longer duration of antibiotic use. Physician justification for antibiotic use was documented in only 116 cases (55%).",
        "The high proportion of women receiving postpartum antibiotics having no evidence for infection or documented indication for therapy suggests that antibiotics may not be appropriately used in the postpartum period."
