        "We analyzed the records of 198 patients with West syndrome (WS) seen at a single pediatric neurology center in Argentina between June 2004 and June 2017. Five patients with infection-related spontaneous remission of the electroclinical manifestations were identified.",
        "The following parameters were investigated: personal and family history, clinical characteristics of the seizures - mainly spasms - and EEG findings, type of treatment, and outcome. The inclusion criteria for WS were epileptic spasms (ES) in clusters, hypsarrhythmia, and mental deterioration. Infants with ES without hypsarrhythmia and other epileptic encephalopathies with ES were excluded.",
        "Five children, four boys and one girl, met the inclusion criteria of WS with spontaneous remission after a viral infection. The etiology of ES was unknown in four patients and one had a structural etiology. All patients had spontaneous remission of the ES and normalization of the EEG following acute upper respiratory infection in four and exanthema subitum in one; all of them had fever between 38.5 and 40 \u00b0C.",
        "We report five patients with spontaneous remission of WS following acute viral infection, associated with a respiratory virus in four and exanthema subitum in one."
