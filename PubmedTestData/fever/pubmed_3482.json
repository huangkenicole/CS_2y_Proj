        "Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is a recurrent fever syndrome of early childhood with increasing number of adult-onset cases. Although it is a self-limited disease, it may negatively affect the quality of life. The aim of this review is to present a detailed analysis of PFAPA syndrome and an algorithm for diagnosis, therapeutic options, and evaluation of outcome. A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases. The main topics covered are the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, etiopathogenesis, genetics, management, disease course and prognosis, disease in adults, unsolved issues, and unmet needs in PFAPA. The diagnosis of PFAPA is mainly based on clinical classification criteria. The most relevant hypothesis for pathogenesis is that dysregulated immune system in a genetically predisposed individual responds to a yet unidentified trigger in an exaggerated way. The pedigree analyses suggest a genetic background for the disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. For management, single-dose corticosteroids during attacks and tonsillectomy remain the most effective therapies, while colchicine is a promising option to decrease attack frequency. There remain unsolved issues in PFAPA such as the exact etiopathogenesis and genetic background, the reason why the inflammation is restricted to the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue, reasons for clock-work regularity of attacks, and self-limited disease course. There is need for a valid diagnostic criteria set with a high performance for both children and adults and consensus on management of PFAPA."
