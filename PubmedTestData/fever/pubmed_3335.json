        "To observe the antifebrile effect of Naoreqing oral liquid (NRQ) in treating post-craniotomic fever, its relationship with the Syndrome type of fever, and the effect of treatment in improving main symptoms.",
        "Patients were randomly divided, according to the ward they accommodated, into three groups, the 86 patients in the TCM group treated with NRQ, the 276 in the TCM-WM group with NRQ plus western medicine (WM) and the 89 in the WM group with WM alone. The antifebrile effect of treatment and the degree of body temperature subsidence in groups were compared, relationship between TCM Syndrome type and antifebrile effect was analyzed and the changes of scores of main symptoms before and after treatment were observed.",
        "The degree of body temperature subsidence and the total antifebrile effective rate in the TCM and the TCM-WM group were similar and better than those in the WM group (P < 0.01). In the TCM-WM group, the antifebrile effects in patients with various Syndrome types, in high to low order, were Dampness-Heat type > Inner-Heat type > Phlegm-Heat type, and the treatment showed definite antifebrile effect in improving main symptoms of patients of various types.",
        "Combination of NRQ and WM has definite antifebrile effect in treating post-craniotomic fever, in a Syndrome-effect dependent manner. At the same time, it also could markedly relieve the various symptoms in patients."
