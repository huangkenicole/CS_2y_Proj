        "Most children with fever without source (FWS) require diagnostic laboratory tests to exclude a serious bacterial infection (SBI), often followed by admission and empirical antibiotics. As febrile children with a viral infection are less likely to have a SBI, identifying patients with systemic viral infection could contribute to exclude SBI. We evaluated whether the presence of virus in the blood could be used as a biomarker to rule out SBI. Children\u2009<\u20093\u00a0years old with FWS were prospectively enrolled and had real-time (reverse-transcription) PCR performed on the blood for adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and HHV6. 20/135 patients had SBI, and in 47/135, at least one virus was detected in the blood. Viremia had a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (90% and 96%) to rule out SBI compared to CRP (65% and 93%) and PCT (55% and 90%). The odds ratio (OR) for the presence of SBI among non-viremic patients was 5.8 (p\u2009=\u20090.0225), compared to 5.5 for CRP\u2009\u2265\u200940\u00a0mg/l (p\u2009=\u20090.0009) and 3.7 for PCT\u2009\u2265\u20090.5\u00a0ng/mL (0.0093). This remained significant after adjusting for CRP and PCT (OR 5.6 and 5.9, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.03 for both). Area under the ROC curve for CRP and PCT were 0.754 and 0.779, respectively, but increased to 0.803 and 0.832, respectively, when combined with viremia.",
        "The presence of viremia had a better performance than commonly used biomarkers to rule-out SBI and could potentially be used in conjunction with CRP and/or PCT in the evaluation of children with FWS. Larger studies should evaluate the role of point-of-care testing of viruses by (revere-transcription) PCR in the plasma in management algorithms of children with FWS.",
