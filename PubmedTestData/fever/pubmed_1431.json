        "This study sought to explore the frequency and prognostic implications of infectious and noninfectious fever following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).",
        "We performed a retrospective cohort study including 194 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at our institution. We identified and characterized all patients who developed fever within the first 72 h following the procedure. We determined the etiology of the fevers (infectious vs. noninfectious) and assessed their impact on in-hospital complications and 1-year mortality.",
        "Following TAVI, 65 (33.5%) patients had fever (mean age 83.7 \u00b1 3.8 years, 70.2% female). An infectious etiology was evident in only 17 of the 65 patients (26.1%) with fever, mainly due to pneumonia (52.9%) and a urinary tract infection (41.2%). No significant difference was observed in baseline characteristics, the mean fever temperature/duration, or signs of inflammatory response between infectious and noninfectious fevers. The mean hospital duration was longer (7 \u00b1 4.8 days vs. 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 days, p = 0.01) among patients with an infectious fever; however, fever had no impact on the 1-year mortality rate (5.9 and 4.5%, respectively, p = 0.71).",
        "Our study demonstrates that, although fever was a common phenomenon after TAVI, it represented an infectious complication only in a minority of cases. Nevertheless, fever, infectious or not, had no impact on the 1-year mortality rate following TAVI."
