      "AbstractText": [
        "Published literature has described the temporal relationship of dexmedetomidine with elevated temperatures, but there is limited data to quantify the incidence of fever in ICU patients receiving dexmedetomidine.",
        "The primary objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of temperature greater than or equal to 38.5\u00b0C in ICU patients receiving dexmedetomidine.",
        "This was a retrospective cohort study of ICU patients who received dexmedetomidine with a propensity-matched subgroup analysis comparing dexmedetomidine fever patients to non-fever patients. Patients 18 years of age and older admitted between November 2017 and August 2018 who received continuous dexmedetomidine for 6 or more hours were eligible for inclusion. Included patients with a temperature of great than or equal to 38.5\u00b0C while receiving dexmedetomidine were established as having dexmedetomidine-related fever.",
        "Of 882 eligible ICU patients, 404 dexmedetomidine patients were included in the study. Sixty-one patients (15.1%) met the definition for the primary endpoint. Forty-two patients who received dexmedetomidine but experienced no fever were matched for multivariate analysis. The fever group received a higher mean maximum infusion rate (0.98 \u00b5g/kg/h \u00b1 0.43 vs. 0.68 \u00b5g/kg/h \u00b1 0.42, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and a longer median duration of dexmedetomidine (43.0 hours [range 7-711] vs. 24.3 hours [6-148], <i>P</i> = 0.001) compared to the non-fever group.",
        "Fever greater than 38.5\u00b0C was observed in 15.1% of ICU patients while receiving dexmedetomidine. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings."
