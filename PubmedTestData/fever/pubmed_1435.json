        "Fever is induced in response to the entrance of pathogenic microorganisms into the body and is thought to be mediated by cytokines. Because these pathogens most commonly invade the body through its natural barriers and because body temperature is regulated centrally, these mediators are presumed to be produced peripherally and transported by the bloodstream to the brain, to act. It is generally considered that their febrigenic messages are further modulated there by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However, the detailed mechanism by which these cytokines signal the brain and activate the febrile response is not yet clear. Indeed, the specific role of each cytokine has been difficult to establish due to complex interactions among them. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that different pyrogens may induce different cytokines; for example, i.v. LPS (a model of systemic bacterial infection) induces large increases in IL-6, but only small rises in IL-1 and TNF alpha plasma levels. Moreover, their appearance lags the fever onset. We recently found that subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, decomplementation, and blockade of Kupffer cells suppress the febrile response of guinea pigs to i.v. LPS, and that i.v. LPS rapidly stimulates the release of norepinephrine (NE) and, hence, of PGE2 in their preoptic-anterior hypothalamus (POA, the brain region containing the thermoregulatory controller). Based on these and other data in the literature, we hypothesize that LPS fever may be initiated as follows: i.v., LPS-->complement-->Kupffer cells-->cytokines?-->vagal afferents -->n. tractus solitarius?-->A1/A2 cell groups?-->ventral noradrenergic bundle? -->POA-->NE-->PGE2-->fever."
