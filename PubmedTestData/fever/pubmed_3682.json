        "Heat-related decreases in cerebral perfusion are partly the result of ventilatory-related reductions in arterial CO2 tension. Cerebral perfusion likely contributes to an individual's tolerance to a challenge like lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Thus increasing cerebral perfusion may prolong LBNP tolerance. This study tested the hypothesis that a hypercapnia-induced increase in cerebral perfusion improves LBNP tolerance in hyperthermic individuals. Eleven individuals (31 \u00b1 7 yr; 75 \u00b1 12 kg) underwent passive heat stress (increased intestinal temperature \u223c1.3\u00b0C) followed by a progressive LBNP challenge to tolerance on two separate days (randomized). From 30 mmHg LBNP, subjects inhaled either (blinded) a hypercapnic gas mixture (5% CO2, 21% oxygen, balanced nitrogen) or room air (SHAM). LBNP tolerance was quantified via the cumulative stress index (CSI). Mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAvmean,) and end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) were also measured. CO2 inhalation of 5% increased PetCO2 at \u223c40 mmHg LBNP (by 16 \u00b1 4 mmHg) and at LBNP tolerance (by 18 \u00b1 5 mmHg) compared with SHAM (P < 0.01). Subsequently, MCAvmean was higher in the 5% CO2 trial during \u223c40 mmHg LBNP (by 21 \u00b1 12 cm/s, \u223c31%) and at LBNP tolerance (by 18 \u00b1 10 cm/s, \u223c25%) relative to the SHAM (P < 0.01). However, hypercapnia-induced increases in MCAvmean did not alter LBNP tolerance (5% CO2 CSI: 339 \u00b1 155 mmHg \u00d7 min; SHAM CSI: 273 \u00b1 158 mmHg \u00d7 min; P = 0.26). These data indicate that inhaling a hypercapnic gas mixture increases cerebral perfusion during LBNP but does not improve LBNP tolerance when hyperthermic."
