        "Intrapartum fever is a well-known predisposing factor for severe perinatal outcomes. Herein, we explored the intrapartum features, obstetric outcomes, and neonatal outcomes in relation to the extent of intrapartum fever <i>via</i> three group analyses.",
        "A retrospective cohort analysis consisting of 575 term, singleton live births in one medical center from January 1st to December 31st, 2020 was carried out. Parturients who had experienced a maximal intrapartum fever of <38.0\u00a0\u00b0C were compared with two sub-groups of parturients who had experienced respective maximal fevers of 38.0-38.9\u00a0\u00b0C and \u226539.0\u00a0\u00b0C. We computed the adjusted risks for adverse perinatal outcomes <i>via</i> multiple logistic regression models to control for confounders.",
        "There were statistically remarkable differences among the three groups in 13 items including body mass index, epidural, and WBC before delivery (<i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast with intrapartum fevers of 37.5-37.9\u00a0\u00b0C, intrapartum fevers of 38.0-38.9\u00a0\u00b0C were linked to an elevated risk of neonatal sepsis and neonatal intensive care unit admission with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.28 (95% CI 2.162-8.479) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.125-2.666), nonetheless, the relationship was remarkably higher for intrapartum fever \u226539.0\u00a0\u00b0C, with an OR of 6.40 (95% CI 2.450-16.725) and 2.23 (95% CI 1.021-4.854). Additionally, intrapartum fevers of 38.0-38.9\u00a0\u00b0C and \u226539.0\u00a0\u00b0C were related to remarkably higher risk for operative deliveries (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.373-3.648; OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.398-9.226; respectively) and histological chorioamnionitis (OR 3.77, 95% CI 2.261-6.271; OR 19.24, 95% CI 7.385-50.111, respectively).",
        "Intrapartum fever is an important indicator of adverse perinatal outcomes. The higher the temperature, the higher risk of histological chorioamnionitis, as well as the risk of neonatal sepsis and neonatal intensive care unit admission."
