        "A 23 year old Russian male cargo ship crew member arrived in the port of New Orleans after a one month voyage originating in central Africa. During the month at sea, he developed fever up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit which was unsuccessfully managed with the antipyretic, dipyrone. He subsequently developed back and stomach pain, along with diarrhea. Upon the ship's arrival to New Orleans, he was transported to a local hospital where his axillary temperature was 104 degrees Fahrenheit. He was unresponsive, tachycardic and tachypneic with a plasma bicarbonate of 16mmol/L (24-32mmol/L)."
