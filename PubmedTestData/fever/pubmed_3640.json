        "the Kenema District Surveillance team in Sierra Leone received notifications of patients with suspected Lassa fever on February 20<sup>th</sup> and March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2019. On that day, an investigation started to confirm the diagnosis and search for additional cases.",
        "we used the Lassa fever surveillance case definition and collected demographic and exposure information from suspected cases through interviews and clinical records. Blood samples were collected from the cases to confirm the diagnosis. Active case finding was conducted in the community and health facility.",
        "on February 10, 2019, an eight-year-old male developed a fever (>39.5\u00b0C) and a sore throat. On February 18, 2019, he was admitted to a hospital and treated for malaria and pneumonia. On February 20, 2019, Lassa fever was suspected because the patient was bleeding from orifices and testing. On February 15, a 5-year-old female developed fever and headache and was treated with anti-malarial drugs. On February 26<sup>th</sup> the high fever re-emerged with severe bleeding from the orifices. She was admitted and treated with antibiotics, confirmed for Lassa fever, and died on March 2, 2019.",
        "the two children had Lassa fever, and no additional cases were identified. We sensitized clinicians on suspicion of Lassa fever to improve early detection and treatment."
