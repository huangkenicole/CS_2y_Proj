        "To evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical pathway in achieving antibiotic administration in less than 60\u00a0minutes for children with cancer, presenting with fever and neutropenia. Secondary objectives were to determine association between time to antibiotics (TTA) and other variables including fever duration, location of care and intravenous access types.",
        "Following introduction of the clinical pathway, we collected prospective data about management of all cases that did and did not use the pathway across multiple sites over 16\u00a0months. A follow-up audit was conducted after 12\u00a0months.",
        "We evaluated a total of 453 presentations. Use of the clinical pathway was significantly associated with achieving TTA in less than 60\u00a0minutes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85, p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.001). Despite varying use of the pathway over time, the median time to antibiotics was achieved in both the initial study period (57\u00a0minutes) and sustained at follow-up (60\u00a0minutes). TTA was also associated with types of intravenous access device and location of care and with length of stay. We did not find any association between TTA and any other variables.",
