        "Postoperative complications are common. Major guidelines have been published on stratifying and managing adverse cardiovascular events and thromboembolic events, but there is often less literature supporting management of other, more common, postoperative complications, including acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal complications, postoperative anemia, fever, and delirium. These common conditions are frequently seen in hospital and can contribute to longer lengths of stay and rising health care costs. These complications are often due to the interplay between both patient-specific and surgery-specific risk factors. Identifying these risk factors, while addressing and optimizing modifiable risks, can mitigate the likelihood of developing these postoperative complications. Often, a multidisciplinary approach, including care team members through all phases of the surgical encounter, is needed. Cardiovascular and thrombotic complications have been addressed in prior articles in this perioperative series. We aim to cover other common postoperative complications, such as acute renal failure, postoperative gastrointestinal complications, anemia, fever, and delirium that often contribute to longer lengths of stay, rising health care costs, and increased morbidity and mortality for patients."
