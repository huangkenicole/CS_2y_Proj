        "Gram-negative and gram-positive infections have been considered the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with leukopenia following chemotherapy. However, discrimination between bacterial infections and harmless fever episodes is difficult. Because classical inflammatory signs of infection are often absent and fever is frequently the only sign of infection, the aim of this study was to assess the significance of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) patterns in identifying bacterial infections during start of fever in normal and cyclophosphamide-treated (leukopenic) rats following an injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or muramyl dipeptide (MDP) as a model for gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. We found that, compared to normal rats, immunosuppressed animals exhibited significantly higher fevers and lesser production of all mediators, except IL-6, after toxin challenge. Moreover, compared to rats that received MDP, both groups of animals that received an equivalent dose of LPS showed significantly higher fevers and greater increase in serum cytokine levels. Furthermore, in contrast to those in immunocompetent rats, serum levels of IL-6 and MIP-2 were not significantly changed in leukopenic animals after MDP injection. Other serum markers such as PCT and CRP failed to discriminate between bacterial stimuli in both groups of animals. These results suggest that the use of the analyzed serum markers at an early stage of fever could give useful information for the clinician for excluding gram-negative from gram-positive infections."
