        "Rebound hyperthermia (RH) is frequently seen after completion of targeted temperature management (TTM) in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. However, its clinical significance is not well understood. Previous studies analyzing the association of RH with clinical outcome have reported conflicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine the impact of RH after completion of TTM in patients postcardiac arrest. We reviewed six studies that evaluated the incidence of RH (T\u2009>\u200938\u00b0C) with documentation of outcome based on the presence of hyperthermia. We reviewed all six articles and extracted the data for mortality and neurological outcome. A total of 729 patients were analyzed for neurological outcome and 950 patients were analyzed for mortality. RH was found to be associated with a significantly worse neurological outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-2.14). RH was not significantly associated with a higher mortality (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.00-1.72). We also analyzed three studies totaling 206 patients for neurological outcomes and mortality that included patients with severe RH (T\u2009>\u200938.5\u00b0C). Severe RH was found to be associated with significantly worse neurological outcome (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.28-1.90) and significantly worse mortality (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.50-3.29). RH is common after completion of TTM in comatose patients because of cardiac arrest and is associated with poor neurological outcomes. The clinical impact of RH is likely proportional to the magnitude of RH."
