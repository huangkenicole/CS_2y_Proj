        "Between the 1st of January 1985 and the 31st of december 1989 101 patients were admitted for fever. Their data were analysed retrospectively. The patients were divided into three groups according to the diagnostic procedures. 32 patients belonged to the first group. The causes of their fever were diagnosed within 24 hours by simple clinical and laboratory means. The second group held 42 patients whose diagnosis were made within one week after detailed laboratory and clinical examinations. The third group (21 patients) fulfilled the criteria of FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin), and the authors analyse this group of patients. Most of the FUO group, 11 patients were diagnosed as infectious origin, 1 tumor, 4 autoimmune. In three cases the diagnosis remained unknown. Authors conclude that patients coming to hospital with fever should deserve more attention of specialist infectologists."
