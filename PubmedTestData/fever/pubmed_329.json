        "The pathophysiology of PFAPA syndrome, mainly characterised by regularly recurring periodic fevers associated with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and/or lymphadenitis, and mostly occurring in the paediatric setting, resembles an acquired autoinflammatory disease. The description of PFAPA syndrome in adult patients is largely increasing.",
        "To recognise PFAPA syndrome in a group of adult patients evaluated for recurrent fevers in our Rheumatology Unit.",
        "To apply current diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome in a group of 359 adults with unexplained recurrent fevers monitored in our Unit between January 2007 and June 2011.",
        "We have found 17 out of 359 patients fulfilling the diagnosis of PFAPA syndrome: these patients (10 males, 7 females) were Caucasian with a mean age of 33.3\u00b19.5 years, had recurrent febrile episodes begun at a mean age of 25.9\u00b18.3 years and a mean number of episodes of 8.3\u00b15.2 per year with a mean duration of 5.5\u00b11.8 days. In particular, 7/17 patients had the 3 cardinal signs, the other 10 had a combination of 2 signs. Corticosteroids were given in 14/17 patients; tonsillectomy was performed in 9/17 patients: corticosteroid responsiveness and tonsillectomy efficacy were observed respectively in 11 and 2 patients.",
