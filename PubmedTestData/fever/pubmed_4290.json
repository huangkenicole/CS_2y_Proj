        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence-based guidelines for fever management of critically ill adult patients with brain injury.",
        "We used a pretest-posttest design with 48 patients 19 years or older admitted to an intensive care unit after surgery for brain injury. We applied evidence-based guidelines only to an experimental group of 24 patients and compared with 24 control patients who did not receive evidence-based guidelines. Experimental and control groups were matched 1:1 using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Data included the proportion of patients with reduced fever and time to normalized temperature.",
        "The proportion of patients whose temperature fell to normal after fever was 4.5 times higher in the experimental group than in the control group. The time it took the patients' highest fever to fall to normal during their intensive care unit stay was 4.84 times faster in the experimental group than in the control group (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-13.11; P = .002).",
        "Evidence-based guidelines for fever management in patients with a brain injury can be used in nursing practice with rapid response, improving healthcare efficiency and contributing to better outcomes for critically ill patients."
