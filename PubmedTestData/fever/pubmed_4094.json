        "Pharmacokinetic parameters which describe the distribution and elimination of sulphadimidine were determined in normal dogs and dogs in which fewer was produced by an intravenous injection of escherichia and staphylococcal species of bacteria. Sulphadimidine was injected as a single intravenous bolus at the dose of 100 mg/kg and the kinetics of the drug were described in terms of the biexponential expression: Cp = Ae-alpha t + Be-beta t. The distribution half-times of the drug were 1.52 h in the normal and 0.81 h in the febrile dogs. The drug distribution was significantly more rapid (P less than 0.05) in febrile than in normal dogs. Average +/- SD values for the half-lives of the drug were 16.2 +/- 5.7 h in normal and 16.7 +/- 4.7 h in the febrile dogs. The apparent volume of distribution (V'd(area)) was 628 +/- 251 ml/kg in the normal dogs, and was not statistically different from 495 +/- 144 ml/kg in the febrile dogs. The volume of the central compartment (V'c) was 445 +/- 55 ml/kg in normal dogs and this was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the V'c of 246 +/- 72 ml/kg in the febrile dogs. The body clearance was 22.4 +/- 4.8 and 20.2 +/- 3.6 ml/hour . kg in the normal and febrile dogs, respectively. The investigation revealed that the dosage regimen of sulphadimidine did not differ significantly between normal and febrile dogs."
