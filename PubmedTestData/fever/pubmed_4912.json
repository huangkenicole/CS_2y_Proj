        "Whether hyperthermia (temperature, 40 degrees C), salicylates, acetaminophen or phenacetin has an adverse effect on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) function was examined. Migration experiemnts were carried out in Boyden chambers with bacterial chemotactic factor as the attract, and bactericidal assays were done with Staphylococcus aureus and serum from an AB blood group donor as a source of opsonins. PMNL viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Neither hyperthermia nor any of the drugs tested affected PMNL viability adversely, but sodium salicylate and phenacetin suppressed PMNL migration. Early staphylococcal killing was greater at 40 degrees C; however, after 2 hours the converse was true. Bactericidal activity was suppressed by acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate and phenacetin. Hence it appears PMNL function is similar at 37 degrees and 40 degrees C but that some commonly used antipyretics have an adverse effect on PMNL activity."
