        "The objective of this study was to answer several questions related to the assessment and treatment of fever, as well as other controversies that exist during its management in pediatric patients. First, an advisory board with medical experts was conducted to discuss the clinical journey of these patients, considering the main challenges and possible solutions. After this discussion, a non-systematic literature review was performed, between November 2019 and January 2020, to collect the most relevant evidence available in the scientific databases MEDLINE, Lilacs, and SciELO. A narrative review was carried out based on scientific evidence and on extensive experience of experts in clinical practice. The experts developed a set of recommendations and clarifications about the assessment of the severity of fever in pediatrics, the need for treatment and the choice of the most appropriate antipyretic. The most common controversies in the management of fever in pediatric patients were also addressed, such as alternating antipyretics, persistent fever, and dose equivalence. In primary management of pediatric patients, fever should be seen as a relevant symptom that requires treatment with antipyretics in potentially more complex or severe cases, when it causes discomfort to children or is associated with infectious diseases."
