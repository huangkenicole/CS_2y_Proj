        "The induction of psychological stress is often accompanied by a transient increase in core temperature, commonly referred to as stress induced hyperthermia. Although stress-induced hyperthermia occurs when rats, mice, and pigs are exposed to a novel stimulus (e.g., a simulated open field, restraint, etc.), whether or not it occurs in guinea pigs has not been investigated. The present experiments were therefore carried out to investigate the thermoregulatory responses of both male (n = 7) and female (n = 7) adult guinea pigs when they were exposed to a simulated open field. Unexpectedly, neither the male nor female guinea pigs developed stress-induced hyperthermia. To the contrary, female but not male guinea pigs significantly decreased their core temperature during an open field experiment. The mechanism of the gender-specific thermoregulatory response of the adult guinea pig to psychological stress is presently unknown."
