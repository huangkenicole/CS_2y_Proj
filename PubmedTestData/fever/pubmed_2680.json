        "The effect of air velocity (AV) on weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency was studied in male broiler chickens exposed to a constant 35 C, 60% RH, and continuous illumination from 4 through 7 wk of age. In two separate trials, AV of 0.5, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 m/s (Trial 1) and 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 m/s (Trial 2) were used. The fifth week was used for acclimation to the targeted environmental conditions. Weight gain was significantly higher in broilers exposed to AV of 1.5 and 2.0 m/s in both trials, which coincided with significantly higher feed intake and feed efficiency. Exposure to the low AV (0.5 and 1.0 m/s) resulted in weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency that were less than those of broilers exposed to high AV (2.5 and 3.0 m/s). In all treatments, broilers developed hyperthermia, but there were no significant differences in body temperature (Tb) among the birds. It can be concluded that AV has a significant effect on broiler performance; the optimal AV was found to be 1.5 to 2.0 m/s."
