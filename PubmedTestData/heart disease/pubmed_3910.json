        "Adolescents often fare poorly after heart transplantation. However, whether the effect of age varies according to the etiology of heart failure is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that age-related heart transplantation outcomes are different in patients with myocarditis and congenital heart disease (CHD).",
        "A retrospective analysis of the United Network of Organ Sharing database was performed for patients with myocarditis (n = 709) and CHD (n = 1,631) undergoing heart transplantation from 1987 to 2011. The effect of age on graft survival was assessed. Age was categorized as children (6-12 years), adolescents (13-18 years), younger adults (19-30 years), and older adults (31-50 years).",
        "For myocarditis, the median graft survival for adolescents was 6.9 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-9.6), which was significantly lower than other age groups (children: 14.1 [95% CI, 9.8-10.9] years, p = 0.004; younger adults: 11.8 [95% CI, 8.3-15.2] years, p = 0.172; older adults: 12.0 years [95% CI, 10.0-14.3 years], p = 0.033). For CHD, the median graft survival for adolescents was 7.4 years (95% CI, 6.8-8.6), which was not significantly different from other age groups (children: 9.0 [95% CI, 7.9-11.0] years, p = 0.737; younger adults: 11.2 [95% CI, 8.6-13.3] years, p = 0.744; older adults: 11.6 [95% CI, 9.2-15.3] years, p = 0.608). Multivariable analysis showed adolescent age was independently associated with worse graft survival for patients with myocarditis but not for CHD.",
        "Adolescents with myocarditis have significantly worse graft survival after heart transplantation, but adolescents with CHD have similar outcomes to other patients with CHD. Further study is needed to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."
