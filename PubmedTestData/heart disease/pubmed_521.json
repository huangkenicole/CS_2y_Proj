      "AbstractText": [
        "Korean health statistics and available research were reviewed, focusing on the gender differences in morbidity and mortality rates of heart disease, and factors affecting health outcomes of heart disease internationally with Korea. The growth rate and aging of population, and the morbidity and mortality rate from heart disease among Koreans were compared to the data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN). Both morbidity and mortality rates from heart disease were higher among women than among men in Korea. However, most of the knowledge about heart disease was based on research conducted on men, and not much is known about women with heart disease. The lack of information about women with heart disease may contribute to delay in diagnosis and treatment, longer stays in the hospital, increased medical costs and a higher mortality rate among women than among men in Korea."
