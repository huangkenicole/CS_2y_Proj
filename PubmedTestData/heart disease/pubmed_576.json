        "Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, are very common in cardiac patients and are independently linked to adverse cardiac outcomes, including mortality. Collaborative care and other integrated care models have been used successfully to manage psychiatric conditions in patients with heart disease, with beneficial effects on function and other outcomes. Novel programs using remote delivery of mental health interventions and promotion of psychological well-being may play an increasingly large role in supporting cardiovascular health.",
        "We review prior studies of standard and expanded integrated care programs among patients with cardiac disease, examine contemporary intervention delivery methods (e.g., Internet or mobile phone) that could be adapted for these programs, and outline mental health-related interventions to promote healthy behaviors and overall recovery across all cardiac patients.",
        "Standard integrated care models for mental health disorders are effective at improving mood, anxiety, and function in patients with heart disease. Novel, \"blended\" collaborative care models may have even greater promise in improving cardiac outcomes, and interfacing with cardiac patients via mobile applications, text messages, and video visits may provide additional benefit. A variety of newer interventions using stress management, mindfulness, or positive psychology have shown promising effects on mental health, health behaviors, and overall cardiac outcomes.",
        "Further study of novel applications of collaborative care and related interventions is warranted given the potential of these programs to increase the reach and effect of mental health interventions in patients with heart disease."
