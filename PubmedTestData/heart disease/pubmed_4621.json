        "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and lung cancer are the most common causes of mortality caused by cigarette smoking. However, these conditions are associated with each other more commonly than would be expected by chance, even when their relationship to smoking is considered. This suggests more fundamental relationships among these conditions. Exploration of those relationships promises to advance the understanding of all three diseases and holds the potential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of these common and devastating conditions."
