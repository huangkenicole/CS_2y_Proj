        "The aim of this review of cardiac disease in pregnancy is to delineate current best practices and highlight emerging themes in the literature.",
        "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among pregnant women in the United States. Many clinicians and institutions have developed care pathways to approach care in these high-risk patients including highly coordinated multidisciplinary teams. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is the greatest risk factor for an adverse event in pregnant women. Vaginal delivery, with good neuraxial anesthesia, is usually the preferred mode of delivery in women with cardiac disease, although the rate of cesarean delivery is higher among women with heart disease.",
        "The leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women is cardiac disease. Preconception counseling is useful for optimizing patients for pregnancy and setting appropriate expectations about care and outcomes. Ensuring that women are cared for in centers with appropriate multidisciplinary resources is key for improving outcomes for cardio-obstetric patients."
