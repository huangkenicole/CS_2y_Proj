        "The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) has been increasing in the adult patient population in part as a result of better patient survival. Patients with more severe CHD are living longer. Nearly all adults with known CHD require periodic imaging as a means of monitoring their disease process. Furthermore, adult patients with suspected CHD require imaging as a means of definitive diagnosis. As a result, it is important for both the referring clinician and the imager to be aware of the most appropriate imaging modality needed to obtain the data most needed to direct the next steps in patient care. Imaging procedures for the diagnosis of known or suspected CHD in the adult include chest radiography, fluoroscopy, echocardiography, nuclear scintigraphy, cardiac-gated CT, MRI, and cardiac catheterization/angiography. The physician trying to diagnose these often complex conditions needs complete and reliable information that includes details about intracardiac and vascular anatomy, hemodynamics, and function. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment."
