        "Heart diseases are characterized as heterogeneous diseases comprising multiple subtypes. Early diagnosis and prognosis of heart disease are essential to facilitate the clinical management of patients. In this research, a new computational model for predicting early heart disease is proposed. The predictive model is embedded in a new regularization based on decaying the weights according to the weight matrices' standard deviation and comparing the results against its parents (RSD-ANN). The performance of RSD-ANN is far better than that of the existing methods. Based on our experiments, the average validation accuracy computed was 96.30% using either the tenfold cross-validation or holdout method."
