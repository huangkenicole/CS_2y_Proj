        "One carries out retrospective study to evaluate the paper that had in our Institution, the echocardiogram for the surgical indication, the necessity to supplement with other diagnostic methods and if there was discrepancy between the diagnostic echocardiography and the surgical finding. A the files were revised of patient smaller than 18 years that were subjected to surgical correction of their congenital heart defect among January 19 at June 30 2003. The patients grouped according to the RACHS-1 in 6 groups of surgical risk and the conclusions were obtained you diagnose echocardiography, the established surgical plan as well as the operative discoveries and the finally carried out surgery type. In the studied period they were carried out to heart surgeries of risk 1, 16 patients (11%); risk 2, 59 patients (43%); risk 3, 52 patients (38%) and 9 patients (6%) the risk 4. There were 9 deaths (6%), 6 were of the group of risk 3; three of the group 2, being 7 patients (77%) smaller than 1 year. They were taken to surgery without catheterize study 62% of the patients. The patients that were subjected to previous catheterize to the surgery, the indication was the complexity of the cardiopathy in 70.8%, for some procedure interventionist in 20% and it stops evaluation of the lung hypertension in 8%. In 28 patients (20%) there was not agreement between the surgical discoveries and the one I diagnose echocardiography basically to not find associate anomalies significant or for an inadequate valuation of the hemodynamic repercussion. The surgery drifted based on the study echocardiography had to modify in 14% of the total of the group, none of the patients died. The cardiopathy where there was repercussion in the outlined surgical handling they were: aortopulmonar window, stenosis of lung veins, anomalous connection of lung veins, anomalies of coronary arteries. The echocardiogram is the angular stone where it rests the diagnosis of the congenital heart defect, the obtained information and its accuracy will be bigger as soon as adult is the clinical support."
