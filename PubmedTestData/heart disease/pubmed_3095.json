        "Cardiac fibroblasts play an essential role in maintaining the structural framework of the heart. Upon stress, fibroblasts undergo a cell state transition to activated fibroblasts (also referred to as myofibroblasts), a highly synthetic cell type that proliferates, migrates, and secrets both extracellular matrix as well as signaling factors that can modulate cellular crosstalk [J. Clin. Invest. 132, e148554]. Activated fibroblasts are critical regulators of cardiac wound healing after injury, but their excessive and persistent activation promote tissue fibrosis, a hallmark feature of the pathological remodeling of the heart. While much of the previous work in cardiac fibroblast biology has focused on the role of canonical signaling pathways or components of the extracellular matrix, recent efforts have been focused on deciphering the gene regulatory principles governing fibroblast activation. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that trigger and sustain the fibrotic process in heart disease has the potential to accelerate the development of therapies that specifically target the cardiac activated fibroblasts, which are at the moment unavailable. This concise review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the chromatin and transcriptional regulation of cardiac fibroblast activation. We discuss recent work from our group and others in this space, highlighting the application of single-cell genomics in the characterization of fibroblast function and diversity, and provide an overview on the prospects of targeting cardiac fibroblasts in heart disease and the associated challenges."
