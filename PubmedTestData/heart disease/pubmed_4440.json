        "The objective was to study the development and progression of heart disease in type 2 diabetic patients and to evaluate the influence of revascularisation procedures on its outcome. A 10-year observation study in 385 patients attending a hospital-based outpatient clinic was performed. A total of 156/385 patients developed myocardial infarction (n=68), angina (n=44), heart failure (n=34) or died (n=109). A high mortality was seen in patients with myocardial infarction (73%) and heart failure (71%), in contrast, to patients with angina (25%). Thirty patients had a coronary angiography because of angina, out of which 23 were revascularised. Four (17%) of patients with bypass surgery or angioplasty died compared with 57 (67%) of the patients with no intervention (p<0.001). The occurrence of myocardial infarction was associated with age (p<0.0001), and mean systolic (p<0.05) and diastolic (p<0.05) blood pressure and degree of albuminuria at entry (p<0.05). Heart failure was associated with age (p<0.0001), and mean HbA(1c) levels (p<0.05), while angina was associated with age only (p<0.05). Death was associated with age (p<0.0001), diabetes duration (p<0.05), mean diastolic blood pressure (p<0.05), and degree of albuminuria at entry (p<0.0001). This study shows a high incidence of heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. The prognosis was better in patients who had had a revascularisation procedure. Thus, a more active attitude towards revascularisation may potentially improve the prognosis for type 2 diabetic patients with atherosclerotic heart disease."
