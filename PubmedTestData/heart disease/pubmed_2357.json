        "To analyze the nature and presentation of print media messages regarding cholesterol and heart disease in women. The hypothesis is that print media messages about cholesterol and heart disease may encourage and perpetuate the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in women.",
        "A hand-search of the \"seven sisters\" of American women's magazines and of two Canadian women's magazines. All print material related to cholesterol and heart disease in women was photocopied and the content analyzed qualitatively. The print media content was divided into two categories: magazine articles and drug industry-sponsored advertisements. Themes were identified and were analyzed for the messages they contained about heart disease, cholesterol, and the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in women.",
        "From the magazine articles, three main messages were identified. First, heart disease is the number one killer of women. Second, women must demand recognition of their hig risk of heart disease and demand equal access to prevention and treatment services for heart disease. Third, lifestyles changes are not enough. Cholesterol-lowering drugs should be considered. Drug advertisements also emphasize that postmenopausal women are at high risk of heart disease and that lifestyle changes are inadequate or insufficient to lower this risk. In both cases, high blood cholesterol is considered not as a risk factor for heart disease but as the disease itself.",
        "Magazine articles and drug advertisements act synergistically and may encourage and promote the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in women. Postmenopausal women not on hormone therapy are particularly targeted."
