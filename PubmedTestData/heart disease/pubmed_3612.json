        "There are minimal data regarding ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD).",
        "The medical records of 6 adult patients with complex CHD who underwent VAD implantation were retrospectively analyzed to characterize pre-operative clinical status, implantation techniques and challenges, post-operative management, and post-operative outcomes.",
        "All patients had a systemic right ventricle, including 2 with single-ventricle physiology. The average age at VAD implantation was 41 years. The implanted VADs included 1 HeartMate XVE, 3 HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA), 1 Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New York, NY), and 1 HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare Inc, Framingham, MA). In-hospital outcomes included no sub-pulmonic ventricular failure, no VAD thrombosis or mechanical failure, 30-day mortality in 1 patient, non-fatal sub-arachnoid hemorrhage in 1 patient, and sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring unsynchronized direct current cardioversion in 1 patient. Of the 5 patients who survived to discharge, 1 patient received 171 days of VAD support before cardiac transplantation and survived for 1,484 days after transplantation; 1 patient received 262 days of VAD support before out-of-hospital death of unknown etiology; 1 patient had received VAD support for 988 days as of December 1, 2012, while awaiting a transplant; and 2 patients who received VADs as destination therapy had received 577 and 493 days of VAD support, respectively, and were still alive as of December 1, 2012.",
        "This case series characterizes important post-operative management challenges and clinical outcomes associated with VAD implantation as a bridge-to-transplant or as destination therapy in adult patients with complex CHD."
