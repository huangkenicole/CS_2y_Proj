        "In a series of 256 patients with acromegaly, 10 had evidence of heart disease for which no explanation apart from the acromegaly could be found. Heart disease presented with effort dyspnoea, cardiac failure, palpitation, ECG changes or cardiomegaly. Initial chest radiographs showed cardiac enlargement in seven patients. Electrocardiograms were abnormal in nine patients with repolarisation disorders or intraventricular conduction defects. Rhythm disturbances were found in six. Echocardiograms were performed on six patients; all were abnormal showing left ventricular hypertrophy or impaired function. In five patients radionuclide ventriculography was also performed. Cardiac catheterisation was undertaken on seven patients; all showed either hypertrophy or dilatation of the left ventricle. Coronary arteries were widely dilated in two patients and in another there was dilation of the proximal segment only. In six of the 10 patients, acromegaly was cured by transsphenoidal surgery. This resulted in limited improvement of cardiac function in two patients only. Of the four patients who were not cured, three died and one was lost to the study. Four patients in total died and autopsies were obtained in two: one showed changes suggesting myocarditis and the other diffuse fibrosis. It is concluded that acromegaly may infrequently lead to heart disease, and that if recognised at an early stage progression may, in a proportion of patients, be arrested by successful treatment."
