        "Currently, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are rising in the world and require great concern because the consequences are not only morbidity and mortality, but also a high economic burden. However, the pattern of CVDs in Ethiopia is not well known. Therefore, this study aimed to describe CVD and co-existing morbidities among newly registered cardiac patients in Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital.",
        "A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2016 among newly registered cardiac patients in an adult cardiac referral clinic. Records and cardiac referral clinic logbooks were used to collect relevant information using structured checklists.",
        "Of the total 310 records of cardiac patients, 236 were explored and included in the study, while the records of 74 patients were absent in the cards room when tracing and/or incomplete to assess cardiac pattern. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was the leading cardiac problem and diagnosed in 70 (29.7%) cases followed by non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (55, 23.3%), ischemic heart disease (41, 17.4%), hypertensive heart disease (29, 12.3%), and cor pulmonale (14, 5.9%). The mean age of RHD patients was 28.7 (\u00b113.1) years. Eighty-two (35%) females and 23 (19.8%) males had RHD, while 69 (29.2%) females and 23 (19.8%) males had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The overall rate of mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and aortic regurgitation among patients with RHD were 39 (55.7%), 48 (68.6%), and 26 (37.1%), respectively. Moreover, the overall coexisted morbidity was 81 (34.3%), with a high rate of hypertension alone at 44 (18.6%) followed by hypertension with diabetes at 11 (4.7%).",
        "This study indicated that more than one-third of cardiac patients had at least one of the co-existing morbidities like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma and other diseases. Therefore, careful diagnosis and management of cardiac patients plays an important role to minimize comorbidity-linked complications. Moreover, population-based studies are recommended for better representing and generalization."
