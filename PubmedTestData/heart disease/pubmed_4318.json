        "To evaluate right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic properties in patients with various heart diseases, RV volume curves obtained from 81mKr scintigraphy with continuous infusion were analyzed. The data were acquired in right anterior oblique position for five minutes, and from RV time activity curve and its first derivative curve, ejection fraction and peak ejection rate as systolic indices, and peak filling rate, time to peak filling and 1/3 mean normalized diastolic filling rate as diastolic indices were calculated. Ejection fraction in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was lower than that in controls, but there was no difference in systolic indices among controls and patients with the other heart diseases. However, diastolic indices in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, patients with hypertensive heart disease, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, patients with inferior myocardial infarction, and some patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction were lower than those in controls. In conclusion, analysis of RV time activity curve by 81mKr scintigraphy with continuous infusion provides RV systolic and diastolic indices, which may permit evaluation of RV systolic and diastolic properties in various heart diseases."
