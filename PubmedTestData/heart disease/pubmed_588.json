        "A total of 122 pregnancies in 101 women with organic heart disease were reviewed. The incidence of organic heart disease in pregnant women was 0.25%. The ratio of rheumatic to congenital heart disease was 1.0 to 1.5. In the congenital heart disease group, IUGR was more frequent in the cyanotic group as were preterm births. Patients with cyanotic lesions had a significantly higher maternal mortality rate than those with acyanotic lesions. The cyanotic group without surgical correction had a significantly higher maternal mortality rate and more IUGR than those with correction. Congestive heart failure was the most common maternal complication, with a rate of 38.1%. The patients with good cardiac status control during pregnancy developed less IUGR, had fewer preterm births, less maternal morbidity and less maternal mortality than those in poor condition. Patients in functional classes I and II before pregnancy carried less risk of maternal morbidity than those in classes III and IV."
