        "Objectives\u2003Although the survival rates of patients with heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure, have increased, the incidence of heart disease in elderly individuals has also increased. We compared characteristics of the community-dwelling elderly with heart diseases (heart disease group) and without heart diseases (non-heart disease group).Methods\u2003A total of 758 elderly individuals participated in our survey (\"Otassha-kensin\") in 2014. The heart disease group (47 men, 28 women) and the non-heart disease group (263 men, 420 women) were selected from among these participants. Data on comorbidities, medications, the Kihon check list (KCL), and social background (lifestyle, exercise habits, certification for using long-term care insurance, and Japan Science and Technology Agency Index of Competence [JST-IC]) were obtained through interview. Body composition, grip strength, 5 walking time (usual pace, maximum speed), timed-up and go test (TUG), single-leg standing time, cognitive function, and depression were evaluated to assess physical and psychological function. Frailty was defined by the KCL. For between-groups comparisons, the Student t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To determine factors related to heart disease with functional decline, we used a multiple logistic regression analysis with the group (the non-heart disease group [0] and the heart disease group [1]) as the dependent variable and the decline in physical and psychological function as the independent variable.Results\u2003Men in the heart disease group had less grip strength, worse balance, and lower JST-IC scores than did men in the non-heart disease group. Women in the heart disease group had greater 5 walking times (usual pace, maximum speed) than those in the non-heart disease group. Both men and women in the heart disease group overall used more drugs and statins, and medications for heart disease than did participants in the non-heart disease group. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, 5 walking time (maximum speed) was shown to be associated with heart disease.Conclusions\u2003The community-dwelling elderly with heart disease showed declined physical functions. Our results suggested that these functional declines may be induced via medication and/or declines in daily activity."
