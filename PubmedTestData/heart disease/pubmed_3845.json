        "Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have always been a matter of debate among physicians and a cause for concern for family members of affected patients. The available literature on isolated PVCs in children is limited to case reports and small single-center retrospective series that are consistent in demonstrating the benign course of PVCs and their frequent disappearance during childhood, though many questions remain unanswered. Nevertheless, two key actions should be undertaken in pediatric patients with documented PVCs: 1) to rule out the presence of structural heart disease; 2) to determine whether symptoms are due to PVCs, or whether PVC frequency is responsible for left ventricular dysfunction. This document aims to provide concise and easy to understand recommendations on the diagnostic work-up of healthy children with simple PVCs and the appropriate clinical and therapeutic approach."
