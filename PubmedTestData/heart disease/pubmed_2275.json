        "\u2002 This article is a report of a study exploring health-related quality of life in adults with congenital heart disease and the extent to which it is associated with patients' illness beliefs and emotional health.",
        "\u2002 A reduction in mortality in patients with congenital heart disease has led to an increasingly older population that faces new challenges. Studies in a younger adult population have reported inconsistent findings regarding health-related quality of life. Factors such as, the complexity of the congenital heart defect, have not been found to be associated with quality of life. The association between illness beliefs and health-related quality of life has not previously been reported.",
        "\u2002 A cross-sectional questionnaire study of adults with congenital heart disease attending an outpatient clinic in a specialist centre in the United Kingdom between October 2007 and May 2008.",
        "\u2002 The mean age of the study population was 37\u00b72 years. Participants reported poorer physical functioning, role functioning and general health than a general population. High levels of anxiety were reported in 38% and high levels of depression in 17%. In multivariate analysis, higher levels of anxiety and depression were associated with poorer mental functioning and higher levels of depression with poorer physical quality of life.",
        "\u2002 We have reported that high levels of anxiety and depression in an older population of patients with congenital heart disease are associated with poorer quality of life. This highlights the need to routinely assess anxiety and depression in this patient group and to provide psychological support appropriately."
