        "We examined whether measurement of the plasma BNP concentrations might be useful for the early diagnosis of the existence and severity of disease in patients with heart disease in daily clinical practice.",
        "The plasma BNP and ANP concentrations in 415 patients with heart disease and hypertension and 65 control subjects were measured. Patients with heart disease had higher plasma BNP and ANP concentrations than did those with hypertension or control subjects. Among the etiology of cardiac diseases, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was associated with the highest plasma BNP concentrations, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy was associated with the highest plasma ANP concentrations. Plasma BNP concentrations showed an increase as the severity of the heart disease, as graded according to the NYHA classification of cardiac function, increased. In both patients with heart disease and hypertension, the plasma BNP values were higher in those who had abnormalities in their echocardiogram and electrocardiogram as compared to those without any abnormalities. The plasma BNP levels also showed a significant correlation with left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular mass. On the other hand, the plasma ANP levels showed significant correlations with left ventricular dimension. Receiver operative characteristic analysis revealed that plasma BNP levels showed substantially high sensitivity and specificity to detect the existence of heart diseases.",
