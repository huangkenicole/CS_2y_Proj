        "Percutaneous endomyocardial biopsy was performed for the diagnosis of various heart disorders in 160 consecutive patients in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Tissue specimens were taken from the left ventricle in 150 patients and from the right ventricule in 10. To determine the clinical merit of endomyocardial biopsy, patients were divided into six groups based upon the existing clinical findings, including cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, specific heart muscle disease, alcohol-induced heart disease, major dysrhythmias, and other diagnoses. The clinical value of endomyocardial biopsy was gauged by the number of diagnoses that were histologically confirmed by the procedure. We combined the percentages of histologically suspected clinical diagnoses with those of completely changed clinical diagnoses and found that endomyocardial biopsy provided useful information in 70.6% of cases. Nonspecific histological findings were found in 25.6% of cases. The biopsy proved to be of no clinical value in only 3.8% of the cases. Although some investigators still object to the overall clinical usefulness of diagnostic endomyocardial biopsy, our findings help to underscore the value of this procedure for making an accurate diagnosis."
