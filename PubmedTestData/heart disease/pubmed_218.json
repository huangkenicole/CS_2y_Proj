        "Two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed in 293 patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent open-heart mitral valve surgery during an 18-month period. Diagnostic confirmation of a left atrial thrombus was based on direct inspection of the left atrium during surgery and histopathologic examination. Two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings were reviewed. Of the 293 patients, 33 had left atrial thrombi by two-dimensional echocardiographic criteria. This diagnosis was confirmed at surgery and histopathologic study in 30 (specificity 98.8%). A thrombus was not found in three patients. In 21 other patients, left atrial thrombi were present but were not detected by two-dimensional echocardiography (sensitivity 58.8%). Ten of these 21 had thrombi in the left atrial cavity. In 11 patients, thrombi were located in the left atrial appendage, all of which were missed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Excluding these 11 left atrial appendage thrombi, the sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiography for detecting left atrial cavity thrombi was 75.0%."
