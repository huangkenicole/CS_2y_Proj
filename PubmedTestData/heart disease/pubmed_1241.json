        "Before the introduction of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the operating room, intraoperative echocardiography relied on epicardial imaging. The disadvantages of this approach included interference with the surgical procedure, limited windows, and potential distortion of cardiac structures. Consequently, multiplane TEE has now emerged as the intraoperative imaging method of choice. It provides high-resolution images of cardiac structures and excellent portraits of flow abnormalities. Intraoperative TEE does not interfere with the surgical field and procedure. TEE provides better imaging of the valves, atria, aorta, pulmonic vasculature, and pericardium, which are sometimes difficult to visualize by transthoracic echocardiography. TEE is especially beneficial in surgeries for valve replacement, valve repair, cardiac mass, aortic disease, congenital heart disease, and pericardial disease. Presurgical TEE provides information for surgical planning. TEE is helpful for the assessment of the immediate result of surgery and detection of complications that may need a prompt response. Thus, intraoperative TEE has a vital impact on management of cardiac surgery."
