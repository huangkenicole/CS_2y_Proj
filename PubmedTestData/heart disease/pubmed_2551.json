        "Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is a useful echocardiographic technique to evaluate global and regional myocardial systolic as well as diastolic function. It can also be used to quantify right ventricular and left atrial function. Recent studies have demonstrated its utility as a diagnostic as well as prognostic tool in different cardiac conditions including coronary artery disease, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies as well as constrictive pericarditis. TDI measurements are also helpful to identify patients who will benefit from cardiac resynchronisation therapy. Even though it is reproducible and relatively easy to obtain, it is underutilised in routine clinical practice. TDI is readily available on most commercially available echocardiographic systems, and we recommend that TDI be used for routine clinical echocardiographic evaluation of patients."
