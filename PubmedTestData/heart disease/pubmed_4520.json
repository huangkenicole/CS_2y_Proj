        "To review the prognosis and management of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) in persons with and without heart disease with emphasis on older adults.",
        "A computer-assisted search of the English language literature (MEDLINE database) followed by a manual search of the bibliographies of pertinent articles.",
        "Studies on the prognosis and management of VA in persons with and without heart disease were screened for review. Studies in older people and recent studies were emphasized.",
        "Pertinent data were extracted from the reviewed articles. Emphasis was on studies involving the older persons. Relevant articles were reviewed in depth.",
        "Available data about the prognosis and management of VA in persons with and without heart disease, with emphasis on studies involving older people, were summarized.",
        "VA in older persons without heart disease should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs should not be used to treat VA in older persons with heart disease. Beta blockers should be used to treat complex VA in older persons with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease if there are no contraindications to beta blocker therapy. The use of amiodarone in treating complex VA should be reserved for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in older persons who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta blockers. VA associated with congestive heart failure should be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. If older patients have life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs, invasive intervention should be performed. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended in older patients who have medically refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation."
