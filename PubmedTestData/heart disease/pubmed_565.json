        "The study was carried out to ascertain the experience of pregnant women with cardiac disease in one referral center.",
        "From 1986 to 2004, 242 pregnant women with heart disease were followed by the same obstetrical and cardiology center. The cardiac diagnosis was additionally confirmed with echocardiography and heart catheterization during cardiosurgery. The subjects were classified into groups with respect to the congenital heart abnormality type, and cardiovascular insufficiency according to the NYHA classification. The results from the evaluated groups were compared to a control group.",
        "A significant increase in percentage of congenital heart disease was found, however acquired cardiac defects prevailed. A significant increase in rate of congenital heart disease was found. A higher incidence of cesarean sections in women with underlying heart disease with respect to the control group was also found.",
        "In pregnant women with underlying heart disease, congenital heart disease is presently more frequent than acquired heart disease compared to the situation in the beginning of the analysis. Pregnancy duration time depends on cardiac sufficiency and it is statistically shorter in NYHA class III and IV patients."
