        "Thirty nine cases, in which sudden cardiac death (SCD) was suspected, were studied to evaluate the mechanism and the prediction of SCD in arrhythmia-patients using electrophysiological studies (EPS). The 39 cases (28 male and 11 female) were located by surveying 2098 patients who underwent EPS for the evaluation of arrhythmias. Age at time of EPS ranged from 4 to 86 years, average 50.5 years. Time from EPS to death was 2 to 163 months, average 27.9 months. Underlying heart disease was: dilated cardiomyopathy in 11, old myocardial infarction in 5, ischemic heart disease in 5, hypertensive heart disease in 5, valvular heart disease in 3, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 1, myocarditis in 1, sarcoidosis in 1, cor pulmonale in 1, and no obvious heart disease in 4. Fifteen had a permanent pacemaker implanted. SCD in cases without a permanent pacemaker (24 cases): 2 had chronic complete A-V block (one BH block, one HV block), 1 had advanced A-V block (HV block), 3 had bundle branch block with first degree HV block, 9 had ventricular tachycardia (VT), 3 had sick sinus syndrome (SSS), 3 had paroxysmal atrial flutter, 1 had WPW syndrome and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 1 had paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and 3 had premature ventricular beats and first degree HV block. SCD in cases with permanent pacemaker (15 cases): 5 had SSS, and 10 had A-V block. In 3 of the 5 with SSS and 7 of the 10 with A-V block, VT was found before pacemaker implantation. In our study, brady and tachyarrhythmias coexisted in 25 cases (64%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
