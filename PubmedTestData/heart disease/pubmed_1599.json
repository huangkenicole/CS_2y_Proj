        "Paediatric cardiology is a dynamic field of progress for results. Those which have marked the year 1999 include the introduction of new techniques of cardiovascular imaging and interventional cardiology, and the new consequences of collaboration with workers in foetal cardiology and medical and molecular genetics. The advances in imaging are the result of those of microprocessors which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of ultrasonic, radiological or magnetic resonance images. This provides intracardiac or intravascular views which are very similar to those seen by the surgeon. This is a major tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. Similarly, the introduction of programmes of tissue recognition enables fine ultrasonic analysis of the vascular wall and of endothelial function leading to the opening of a new chapter of preventive vascular medicine from the earliest age. Paediatric interventional cardiology has also progressed rapidly and the past year has been that of a consensus on the closure of a great number of atrial septal defects by new prostheses implanted and anchored in a simpler and safer manner. Prenatal diagnosis has become a crucial factor in the treatment and prognosis of congenital heart disease which is life-threatening in the first hours of life, explaining the benefit when this is applied to transposition of the great vessels or to coarctation of the aorta. Finally, advances in genetics have led to the identification of several genes of heart malformations and the correlations between interstitial microdeletions and syndromes often associated with heart disease: chromosome 22q11 and the Di George syndrome, chromosome 7q and the Williams syndrome. They have even allowed linking of myocardial and cerebellar abnormalities of a degenerative neuropathy (Friedreich's disease) to an abnormality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus giving the opportunity of a real treatment."
