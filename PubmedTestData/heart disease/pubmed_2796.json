        "The aim of this paper is to study the correlation between the cardiac output index value and the prognosis of patients with heart disease with the help of Pulse-induced Contour Cardiac Output (PICCO) and computed tomography (CT). Three hundred eighteen patients with pathologically confirmed heart disease were selected as study subjects. The Sime ns Av anto 1.6T type superconducting magnetic resonance meter and GE Light Speed Pro 48 slice spiral CT were used for the phased array coil scanning and enhanced scanning, respectively and to analyze the relationship between the cardiac output index value and prognosis in patients with heart disease with the help of PICCO and CT. The accuracy rates of PICCO and CT in determining the cardiac output index of heart disease were 93.2% and 76.1%, respectively, which were significantly different (P less than 0.05). The coincidence rate between the results of the cardiac output index and pathological results of heart disease from PICCO and CT were 57.6%and 54.7%, respectively. According to the \u03c72 test results, the diagnostic results of PICCO were consistent with the pathological results of the heart disease group (Kappa = 0.039, 0.496, P less than 0.05). The coincidence rate for the five-year survival rate of PICCO/CT with the total survival rate and the results of the patients were 56.7% and 43.8%, respectively. The coincidence rate of PICCO and CT diagnosis results with the cardiac output index values, as well as prognosis results, was high. In judging the value of the cardiac output index and the prognosis of patients with heart disease, PICCO was superior to CT. The diagnostic results of PICCO have a strong correlation with the pathological results, therefore, PICCO can be used to accurately determine the cardiac output index and the prognoses of patients with heart disease."
