        "An analysis of cardiac fatal cases from elementary, junior and senior high school students of Osaka revealed the following features: 1) The mortality rate of the cardiacs under the heart disease program is two times as high in senior high school students as in elementary school and junior high school students. The same rate for males is significantly higher than the rate for females. 2) The mortality rate according to types of heart disease is the highest among cardiomyopathy. This rate is followed by the rates for acquired valvular heart disease, for unoperated congenital heart disease and for operated congenital heart disease in that order. However, the actual number of fatal case is largest among those with congenital heart disease exceeding more than half of the total number of deaths. 3) Recently the mortality rate showes a decreasing tendency. The number of deaths due to chronic congestive heart failure has decreased, but sudden deaths have increased. 4) Sudden deaths are mostly encountered in moderate or severe cardiac cases. Therefore, it is mandatory to accurately locate the cases with high potentiality for sudden death and to place them under proper supervision. 5) In one third of the cases of sudden death, no significant physical or behavioral causes were found to trigger the death. It seems to be difficult to prevent all the sudden deaths, therefore, it is important to establish successful emergency programs."
