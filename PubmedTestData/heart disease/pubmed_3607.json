        "Two-dimensional visualization of complex congenital heart disease has limitations in that there is variation in the interpretation by different individuals. Three-dimensional printing technology has been in use for decades but is currently becoming more commonly used in the medical field. Congenital heart disease serves as an ideal pathology to employ this technology because of the variation of anatomy between patients. In this review, the authors aim to discuss basics of applicability of three-dimensional printing, the process involved in creating a model, as well as challenges with establishing utility and quality."
