        "This study had two aims: a) to investigate the diagnostic value of right heart catheterization at rest and during exercise in patients with angina pectoris and dyspnea, and b) to find out whether right heart catheterization during exercise provides additional diagnostic information when the correct diagnosis has been established by invasive means. The findings in 109 patients with coronary or myocardial heart disease (average age 50 years) were investigated retrospectively. Right heart catheterization is a semiinvasive measure which permits the differentiation of normal ventricles from ventricles with impaired function during exercise; further diagnostic information cannot be obtained, however. In patients with angina pectoris, right heart catheterization has no greater diagnostic value than the ECG during exercise. The patients were divided into five groups according to the final diagnosis: 55 with coronary heart disease, 11 with dilatative and 6 with latent cardiomyopathy, 26 with systemic hypertension, and 11 without heart disease. The results show that right heart catheterization during exercise is absolutely necessary in addition to invasive measures in patients with normal function of the left ventricle at rest and without coronary heart disease, as these patients show either a normal (patients with systemic hypertension, patients without heart disease) or an abnormal increase in pulmonary artery pressure during exercise (patients with systemic hypertension, patients with latent cardiomyopathy). Patients without coronary heart disease but with impaired left ventricular function even at rest always show a pathological increase in pulmonary artery pressure during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
