        "We treated 10 cases of thoracic malignancy accompanied with cardiovascular disease. Among thoracic malignancy, 7 cases were lung cancer and 3 were esophageal cancer. Accompanied cardiovascular diseases were ischemic heart disease (2 cases), valvular disease (3 cases), WPW syndrome (1 case), aortic aneurysm (4 cases). The mean age was 66, ranged from 51 to 79. The simultaneous occurrence of the two lesions were observed in 6 cases and thoracic malignancy was diagnosed after a varying interval of time following surgery of cardiovascular disease in 4 cases. In cases of thoracic malignancy accompanied with heart disease, the treatment of heart disease should precede the operation of malignant disease to reduce the risk of surgery. For the patient with esophageal cancer, posterior mediastinal esophagostomy should be applied who may have heart surgery in future. In cases of coexisting malignancy and aortic aneurysm, the priority of treatment should be determined considering the size of aneurysm. If the transverse diameter of aneurysm is larger than 7 cm, there is a high risk of rupture, so surgery for the aneurysm precedes operation of malignant diseases. It is desirable to avoid concomitant operation of malignancy and cardiovascular disease."
