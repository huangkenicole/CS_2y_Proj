        "Few data are available on the spectrum and frequency of issues addressed in the paediatric cardiology consultation service of tertiary academic hospitals.",
        "Those activities were collected prospectively during 6 months.",
        "A total of 967 consultations were performed. The origin was mostly the medical ward (n = 535), the intensive care unit (n = 195), the neonatal unit (n = 97), the operating room (n = 84) and the nursery (n = 44). In 553 cases, a heart disease was previously known and the most common reasons of consultation were postoperative (n = 279) and preoperative evaluations (n = 129). Thirteen newborns had a prenatal suspicion of congenital heart disease, which was confirmed in 11 cases. For the other 401 consultations, the most common clinical concerns included cardiac function in oncological disease (n = 60), murmur (n = 48), syncope (n = 33), diabetes mellitus (n = 28), prematurity (n = 27), syndrome (n = 19), unexplained stridor or respiratory distress (n = 19) and unexplained fever (n = 15). There were new diagnoses of congenital heart disease, acquired heart disease and arrhythmias in 35, 17 and 5 cases, respectively.",
        "The workload of the paediatric cardiology consultation service is increasing alarmingly. These data may be helpful in future planning of consultant manpower and in curriculum development in cardiac training of students and residents."
