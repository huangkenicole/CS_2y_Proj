      "AbstractText": [
        "On the bamboo slips found in the No. 2 Chu Grave unearthed in Baoshan, Jingmen, Hubei Province in 1986, there were records about its host, Shao Tuo, consulting a sorcerer for his disease from March 4 (Chu Calendar) 317 B.C. to May 7th (Chu calendar), 316 B.C. As a result of textual research on the name of disease recorded as heart disease, lower heart disease and abdominal heart disease; the symptoms such as short breath, upper abdominal distension and dropsy; the characteristics of the disease such as sudden and intermittent onset, more and more severe condition, relatively rapid death and so on, it is considered that Shao Tuo died of cardiac disease. The two possible reasons why Shao Tuo suffered from cardiac disease are also discussed."
