      "AbstractText": [
        "The development of Bad Nauheim, a German spa that over 2 centuries became dominant in the attraction of patients with heart disease is described. Here, patients experienced a regimen of saline baths and mostly static exercises developed by the Schotts, 2 physician brothers. Concomitant with the bathing and exercises, there was a social atmosphere conducive to relaxation. Many visiting physicians were impressed that there were improvements in the patients' cardiac status. One skeptical exception was Sir James Mackenzie, whose views are synopsized. The reported improvements may have had a modicum of a physiologic base, from recent investigations on the nature of heart failure, and may have anticipated the current use of exercise in cardiac rehabilitation."
