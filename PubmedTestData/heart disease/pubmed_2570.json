        "CAD is the most common cause of death in older persons and was present in 43% of 1,160 men and in 41% of 2,464 women, mean age 81 years. Hypertension was present in 60% of these older women and in 57% of these older men. The prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and MAC increases with age in older men and in older women. The prevalence and incidence of CHF increase with age. CHF is the most common cause of hospitalization in persons aged 65 years and older. The prevalence of normal LV ejection fraction associated with CHF increases with age and is higher in older women than in older men. The prevalence of chronic atrial fibrillation increases with age and was present in 16% of 1,160 older men and in 13% of 2,464 older women. Atrial fibrillation is an independent predictor of new coronary events and thromboembolic stroke in older persons. Older persons who have unexplained syncope should have 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms to determine whether pauses of longer than 3 seconds are present that require permanent pacemaker implantation."
