        "Dental procedures are a common reason for general anesthesia, and there is widespread concern among veterinarians that heart disease increases the occurrence of anesthetic complications. Anxiety about anesthetizing dogs with heart disease is a common cause of referral to specialty centers. To begin to address the potential effect of heart disease on anesthetic complications in dogs undergoing anesthesia for routine dental procedures, we compared anesthetic complications in 100 dogs with heart disease severe enough to trigger referral to a specialty center (cases) to those found in 100 dogs without cardiac disease (controls) that underwent similar procedures at the same teaching hospital. Medical records were reviewed to evaluate the occurrence of anesthetic complications. No dogs died in either group, and no significant differences were found between the groups in any of the anesthetic complications evaluated, although dogs in the heart disease group were significantly older with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. Midazolam and etomidate were used more frequently, and alpha-2 agonists used less frequently, in the heart disease group compared to controls. This study suggests dogs with heart disease, when anesthetized by trained personnel and carefully monitored during routine dental procedures, are not at significantly increased risk for anesthetic complications."
