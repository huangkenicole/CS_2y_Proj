        "Clinical trials traditionally aim to show a new treatment is superior to placebo or standard treatment, that is, superiority trials. There is an increasing number of trials demonstrating a new treatment is non-inferior to standard treatment. The hypotheses, design and interpretation of non-inferiority trials are different to superiority trials. Non-inferiority trials are designed with the notion that the new treatment offers advantages over standard treatment in certain important aspects. The non-inferior margin is a predetermined margin of difference between the new and standard treatment that is considered acceptable or tolerable for the new treatment to be considered 'similar' or 'not worse'. Both relative difference and absolute difference methods can be used to define the non-inferior margin. Sequential testing for non-inferiority and superiority is often performed. Non-inferiority trials may be necessary in situations where it is no longer ethical to test any new treatment against placebo. There are inherent assumptions in non-inferiority trials which may not be correct and which are not being tested. Successive non-inferiority trials may introduce less and less effective treatments even though these treatments may have been shown to be non-inferior. Furthermore, poor quality trials favour non-inferior results. Intention-to-treat analysis, the preferred way to analyse randomised trials, may favour non-inferiority. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses should be recommended in non-inferiority trials. Clinicians should be aware of the pitfalls of non-inferiority trials and not accept non-inferiority on face value. The focus should not be on the p values but on the effect size and confidence limits."
