        "From 95,196 sample adults in the combined 2010, 2013, and 2015 U.S. National Health Interview Survey, we estimated the association between histories of epilepsy and heart disease after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors. Adults 18\u202fyears old or older with an epilepsy history reported heart disease (21%) about nine percentage points more often than those without such a history (12%), overall and within levels of characteristics and risk factors. These increases in heart disease history for adults with an epilepsy history compared with adults without such a history were greater in those 45-64\u202fyears old or at the lowest family income levels. These increases of heart disease in adults with an epilepsy history highlight two needs-to prevent the occurrence of heart disease and to reduce its consequences. Because comorbidity from heart disease can complicate epilepsy management, physicians caring for those with epilepsy should be aware of these increased risks, identify risk factors for heart disease, and recommend to their patients with epilepsy ways to diminish these risks."
