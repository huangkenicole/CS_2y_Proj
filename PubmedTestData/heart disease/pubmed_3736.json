        "Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is a late complication of chronic high blood pressure. Each year HHD claims the lives of more than 20,000 people in the United States. Between 1979 and 2003, 8735 Wisconsin residents died as a direct result of the condition. While annual death rates were relatively stable over this time period, racial and regional variations were observed. Wisconsin's African American community had an age-adjusted death rate of 26.1 per 100,000 for HHD. In comparison, rates among whites and other races were 6.5 and 4.3 per 100,000, respectively. Regional rates were highest among residents of Milwaukee County. While additional research is needed to determine the cause of these disparities, our findings suggest that hereditary and environmental factors are important determinants of risk and demonstrate the importance of early screening and aggressive treatment of hypertension among high-risk populations."
