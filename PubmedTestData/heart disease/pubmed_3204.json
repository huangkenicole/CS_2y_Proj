        "This study aims to investigate the relationship between the value of cardiac output index (COI) and pathological Gleason score of heart disease by color Doppler. The dynamic contrast-enhanced color Doppler data of 312 patients with heart disease were collected. Multi-parameter oxygen concentration images based on color Doppler were used to detect the COI of heart disease. Multi spin relaxation time editing sequence and weak diffusion model were used to estimate the oxygen saturation level and pO2. The biological behavior and prognosis of the patients were determined according to the haematoxylin and eosin staining of the cardiac pathological tissues and Gleason score, and the relationship between the COI and Gleason score level of heart disease was evaluated. Of the 312 patients, 28 cases had a Gleason score 10, 112 had score 9, 56 had score 8, and 116 had score \u2264 7. According to the degree of differentiation, they were divided into middle-high differentiation group (Gleason scores \u2264 7) and low differentiation group (Gleason scores 8-10). Multi-parameter oxygen concentration images based on color Doppler were successfully built, the COI was measured, and the Gleason scores and classification for the patients were made. There was a positive correlation between the value of COI and Gleason score (r =0.349, P less than 0.05). There was significant difference in the value of COI between the middle-high differentiation group and the low differentiation group (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, the value of COI is positively associated with Gleason score; COI values may be used to evaluate the classification of heart disease and the prognosis of patients."
