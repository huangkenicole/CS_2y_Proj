        "Patients with pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) secondary to left heart disease can be further classified according to their hemodynamic profile: pulmonary hypertension (PH) in proportion to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and PH out of proportion to the PCWP or reactive PH. Currently, there are no measures that enable prediction of the development of reactive PH in patients with left heart disease.",
        "In this study, we aim to characterize PVH patients with reactive PH as compared to proportional PH in an attempt to create a distinct profile for patients with left heart disease carrying a high risk for the development of reactive PH.",
        "Thirty-three PVH patients with reactive PH and 29 PVH patients with proportional PH were analyzed retrospectively over a 6-year period. Clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters were noted and compared between subgroups.",
        "There was no significant difference between PVH patients with reactive and proportional PH with regard to gender, age (65.91 \u00b1 11.9 vs. 66.69 \u00b1 10.5 years) and body surface area (1.89 \u00b1 0.24 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.23 m(2)). Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome components was similar in both groups. Interestingly, PCWP was similar in both groups, as were the structural and functional parameters of the left heart.",
        "PVH patients with reactive PH have a similar profile as patients with proportional PH; consequently, the evolution of reactive PH is unpredictable. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians maintain a high index of suspicion for the development of reactive PH even in the early stage of heart disease."
