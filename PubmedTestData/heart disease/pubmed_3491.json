        "Transcatheter interventions have assumed an important role in the management of many forms of congenital heart disease. While complications of transcatheter interventions are uncommon and usually minor, significant complications requiring operation do occur on occasion. The purpose of this report is to present our experiences with seven such complications, and to review the literature on this topic.",
        "Seven patients who required operation after a transcatheter dilation procedure between 1992 and 1998 are described. Three patients required retrieval of retained foreign bodies (stents or balloons), and repair of the underlying abnormality. Two patients underwent repair of fistulas between 2 great vessels, or a great vessel and a cardiac chamber. One patient required operation for a postdilation aneurysm. One patient underwent urgent repair of severe aortic regurgitation after balloon aortic valvuloplasty.",
        "All patients survived and are doing well, with no further need for catheter or operative intervention, from 8 months to 6 years after operation. Additional reported complications requiring operation are discussed as well.",
        "Operation for complications of catheter interventions in congenital heart disease is seldom necessary. Though uncommon, a variety of such complications may occur, including vascular, valvar, intracardiac, and foreign body complications. When operation is required, results are typically very good."
