        "In contrast to the adult age group, epidemiologic studies on heart failure (HF) in the pediatric population are lacking. The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the epidemiology of HF during infancy and childhood.",
        "Of the 1,196 children with congenital and acquired heart diseases, primarily diagnosed during a 10-y period in one hospital, we identified those patients who developed HF.",
        "Within 10 y, 1,196 children with heart disease were indexed. Heart failure occurred in 124 of these patients (10.4%): 64 out of 1,031 children with congenital heart diseases (6.2%), 13 out of 96 children with rhythm or conduction disturbances (13.5%), 23 out of 39 children with acquired heart diseases (59.0%), and 24 out of 30 children with cardiomyopathies (80.0%). Heart failure occurred in 72 cases (58.1%) during the first year of life. The incidence in infancy was much more pronounced for congenital heart diseases than for other cardiac conditions. The mortality associated with HF and its cause was also lower for children with congenital heart disease (4.7%) than for the other cardiac conditions (8.7%, 23.0%, and 25.0%, for acquired heart diseases, rhythm disturbances, and cardiomyopathies, respectively).",
        "Clear differences exist between HF in infants and HF in children. Our study supports the observation that congenital heart disease is the most common causative factor of HF during infancy. Older children with HF are more likely to have acquired heart diseases, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias, and these conditions have a considerable mortality."
