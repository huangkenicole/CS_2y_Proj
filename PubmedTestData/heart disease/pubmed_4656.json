        "Cardiac computed tomography in its present form provides useful information about the heart for clinical use in patients with heart disease and for investigative work in such patients and living animals. Its great reconstructive power and unmatched density resolution are particularly advantageous in the study of ischemic heart disease. Because of its non-invasive character cardiac computed tomography has the potential of becoming an effective screening tool for large numbers of patients with suspected or known coronary heart disease. Other cardiac conditions such as valve disease and congenital lesions can also be examined with high diagnostic yield. However presently available scanners suffer from low repetion rate, long scan times and the fact that only one transverse cardiac level at a time can be obtained. The development which must be accomplished in order to eliminate these weaknesses is technically feasible. The availability of a dynamic cardiac scanner would greatly benefit the treatment of patients with heart disease and facilitate the inquiry into the pathophysiology of such diseases."
