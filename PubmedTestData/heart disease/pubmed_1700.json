        "Over a five-year period, we reviewed 19 fetuses who were prenatally diagnosed with congenital heart disease, including hemodynamically significant arrhythmias. Five of them had fetal tachyarrhythmias, and 14 had structural heart disease. The outcomes were: six intrauterine deaths, five neonatal deaths, and three infant surgeries. Six of the fetuses had chromosomal abnormalities, four had extracardiac anomalies, and two had hydrops fetalis. Of the 96 neonates with congenital heart disease found during the study period, the overall detection rate was 20%; 16% of the neonates with structural cardiac defects and 83% of the neonates with arrhythmias. Some of the complex cardiac defects with normal fetal four-chamber view were difficult to detect prenatally. During the course of the pregnancy, 37% of the fetuses with prenatally diagnosed congenital heart disease were found to have intrauterine growth retardation, and 26% were found to have an abnormal amniotic fluid volume. In view of our findings, a comprehensive screening system should be more frequently considered in order to improve both detection rate and perinatal management."
