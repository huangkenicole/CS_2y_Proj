        "To study the concurrence of congenital heart disease and hypospadias and the relationship between the two diseases.",
        "We investigated the incidence and types of congenital heart disease accompanied by hypospadias in male children received in our hospital from January 2002 to December 2012, compared them with those in the general population, and analyzed the correlation of different types of heart disease with the incidence rate of hypospadias.",
        "Of the 7 385 male children with congenital heart disease, 134 (1.81%) were found with hypospadias, with a significantly higher morbidity than in the general population (0.33% -0.40%) (P < 0.01). The incidence rates of hypospadias were significantly higher in the groups of ventricular septal defect (65/3 275, 1.98%), Fallot's tetralogy (17/770, 2.21%), macroangiopathy (15/788, 1.90%) and other congenital heart abnormalities (21/972, 2.16%) than in the atrial septal defect (10/1 015, 0.99%) and patent ductus arteriosus (6/565, 1.06%) groups (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the type of hypospadias among different heart disease groups (P > 0.05).",
        "Hypospadias is a common concurrent condition in male children with congenital heart disease. The incidence rate of hypospadias is related with the type of congenital heart disease, and the two conditions may have some common pathogenic or susceptive factors."
