        "Cardiovascular risk factors are those environmental, behavioral, genetic, and/or personal factors whose presence indicates a heightened risk of subsequent vascular disease events. Smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, initially identified by astute clinicians, were all subsequently confirmed and defined as risk factors through formal prospective epidemiologic study, long before evidence of causality was available. Ultimately, clinical trials demonstrated a reversible contribution of both high blood pressure and elevated lipids to stroke and heart disease. As a result, these risk factors are now the cornerstones for both assessment of relative cardiovascular risk and targets for preventive intervention. The criterion for risk factor status is a strong, consistent, timely, and statistically significant association to disease events that is independent of and unconfounded by other known risk factors. The purpose of this review is to assess available data to determine whether or not serum uric acid meets the standard for designation as a risk factor."
