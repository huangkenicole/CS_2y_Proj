        "This article offers a symbolic analysis of the cultural construction and signification of three of the major \"pandemics\" of the late 20th century: AIDS, cancer, and heart disease. It is based on unstructured interviews conducted in Israel between 1993-94 with 75 nurses and 40 physicians and between 1993-95 with 60 university students. Two key symbols, \"pollution\" and \"transformation,\" are shown to constitute AIDS and cancer within a symbolic space that I suggest is \"beyond culture,\" where body boundaries are dissolved and cultural categories are dismantled. Heart disease, in contrast, is metaphorized as a defect in the \"body machinery.\" The article concludes by arguing that heart attack is depicted as the pathology of the Fordist, modernist body, while AIDS/cancer are pathologies of the postmodern body in late capitalism."
