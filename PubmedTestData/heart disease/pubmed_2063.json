        "Scarce data on crowdfunding report a maximal funding of \u20ac10.000,-, and state that research is needed to attract attention of larger granting organizations. The aims of this project were 1) to fund an eHealth study in grown-up congenital heart disease (GUCH) patients 2) to contemplate on critical success factors.",
        "After peer review of the Dutch Heart Foundation a project was published at a donation platform, which was open for donations during a predetermined period of two months. Copywriters were hired to create an easy-to-understand message to donors. A video teaser was created with a motivated patient, and rewards were available. The crowdfunding targeted \u20ac25.000 and the Dutch Heart Foundation doubled the donations to \u20ac50.000, and return of donations were guaranteed in case this was not met.",
        "Initially, donations came from the investigators' private inner circle. In total, 44 potential donors were contacted, but refused to donate originally. Multiple (social) media campaigns were published to promote the project, and an offline mailing was sent to contributors to the Dutch Heart Foundation. During the project support emerged, resulting in extra donations and public awareness. In the lasts three weeks, after sufficient private donations, five major donors decided to support the project. The project became a big success: the predetermined target was exceeded and a total of \u20ac74.450,- was raised.",
        "Innovative crowdfunding gave the opportunity to start eHealth research in GUCH patients. Critical success factors include support of a professional organization, support of stakeholders, and easy-to-understand messages."
