        "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) with involvement of the His-Purkinje system (HPS) can be difficult to recognize in patients with heart disease, but it may be particularly susceptible to ablation targeting the HPS. This study defines the incidence and types of HPS involvement in VT.",
        "Involvement of the HPS was sought during electrophysiologic study with catheter mapping in 234 consecutive patients referred for catheter ablation of recurrent VT associated with heart disease. HPS VT was observed in 20 (8.5%) patients (mean ejection fraction 29%+/- 17%); in 9 (11%) of 81 patients with nonischemic heart disease and 11 (7.1%) of 153 patients with coronary artery disease (P = NS). Three types of HPS VT were observed: 16 patients (group 1) had typical bundle branch reentry, 2 patients (group 2) had bundle branch reentry and interfascicular reentry, and 2 patients (group 3) had VT consistent with a focal origin in the distal HPS. In all three groups, the VT QRS had morphologic similarity to the sinus rhythm QRS. Ablation of HPS VT was successful in all patients in whom it was attempted but produced high-degree AV block in 6 (30%). In 12 patients (60%), other VTs due to reentry through scar also were inducible.",
        "Involvement of the HPS in VT associated with heart disease has three distinct clinical forms, all of which are susceptible to ablation. Ablation often is not sufficient as the sole therapy due to other induced VT's and conduction abnormalities, requiring pacemaker and/or defibrillator implantation."
