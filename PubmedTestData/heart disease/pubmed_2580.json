        "The long-term prognosis and prognostic factors were assessed in patients with left ventricular dilatation with impaired function secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or to heart diseases of various pathogeneses masquerading as DCM (DCM-like). The echocardiographic criteria for DCM-like disease were 1) left ventricular end-diastolic dimension exceeding 60 mm and 2) fractional shortening less than 15%. Those who showed improvement in either of these 2 parameters within 3 months were excluded from this study. One hundred and fifty-eight of 35,250 serially examined patients fulfilled the definitions. The pathogeneses of diseases were valvular heart disease (VHD) in 30 patients, ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 37, alcoholic cardiomyopathy (AC) in 12, hypertensive heart disease (HHD) in 31 and DCM in 48. All of the survivors were followed for more than 24 months; an average of 40 months. During this period, there were a total of 75 deaths, 18 (27%) of whom were judged as sudden death. Five-year survival rates calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method in AC and HHD were 86% and 77%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in DCM (48%; p < 0.05); whereas, patients with VHD and IHD had lower values (60% and 46%, respectively) which were nearly equal to those in DCM. Factors that contributed to the increase in total cardiac mortality were advanced age, higher NYHA functional class, larger cardiac size on chest radiograph and history of heavy alcohol intake. Each of these factors were closely related to the specific pathogeneses as follows: age to IHD, cardiac size to VHD, and NYHA functional class to DCM. Long-term prognosis of DCM-like heart diseases, especially those of IHD and VHD, seemed to be as bad as those of DCM."
