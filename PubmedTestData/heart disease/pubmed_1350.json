        "In Georgia, like the other post soviet republics CHD morbidity is increasing, especially among young and middle aged people i.e. among those who should have the most working ability that points at both individual and social significance of the problem. CHD is becoming more and more common among rural inhabitants, different professional groups involved not only in mental but also in physical work. There is growing evidence that socio-economic status (SES) is one of predictors of coronary heart disease and its risk-factors, though the direction of the relationship is not stable and differs by countries. SES is characterized by factors as education, occupation, income, housing conditions, etc. Education is the most widely used measure of socio-economic status in epidemiologic studies. Our research aimed assessment of the relationship between education and coronary heart disease that will contribute to selection of target groups and correct planning of primary and secondary prevention measures. A case-control study was carried out. The study results indicate that Georgia is in the transitional period and probably in several years education and CHD will have negative correlation."
