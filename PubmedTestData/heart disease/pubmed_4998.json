        "To determine the prevalence of heart disease diagnosed de novo in pregnancy in a West London population and to re-examine the current role of routine cardiovascular examination in antenatal care in the UK.",
        "Retrospective study.",
        "Obstetric medical clinics at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, University College Hospital and Northwick Park Hospital.",
        "Three hundred and twenty women referred for cardiac evaluation during pregnancy.",
        "The majority of the 139 women referred specifically for evaluation of murmurs during pregnancy were found to have physiological murmurs (97%). Only four women (3%) were found to have significant cardiac lesions de novo in their pregnancy. Three of these four women were immigrants who had no previous history of heart disease. The only woman from the UK was already known to have a murmur from childhood.",
        "Our study shows that heart disease diagnosed de novo in pregnancy in a West London population is an uncommon problem with low prevalence. It also appears to be a problem seen mainly in the immigrant population. The results emphasise the importance of taking a thorough medical history in all pregnant women. However, our results if they are confirmed, would suggest that only immigrants and those with significant symptoms or a known history of heart murmur or heart disease need undergo cardiovascular examination during pregnancy. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger group in other parts of the UK before further recommendations on selective cardiovascular examination can be made. This will have significant implications for midwifery-led care."
