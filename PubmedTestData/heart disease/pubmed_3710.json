        "Patients hospitalized with acute heart disease [acute myocardial infarction (MI); heart disease exacerbation] may require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. These patients are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Hematological biomarkers may help to identify increased mortality risk. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between hematological biomarkers and survival in these patients.",
        "A historical cohort study of all patients admitted to an internal medicine department, who were diagnosed with acute heart disease and requiring RBC transfusion, was carried out in a tertiary medical center between 2009-2014. The association between hematological biomarkers and 30-, 90-day and 5-year mortality was studied.",
        "A total of 254 patients (median age 80 years, IQR 74-86.25; 40.9% females; acute MI 24.8%), were included. During the 5-year follow-up 212(83.5%) patients died. In a multivariate analysis the lower platelet to neutrophil ratio (PNR) was significantly associated with increased 30-, 90-day and 5-year mortality (p<0.001, 0.041, 0.003 respectively). A higher red cell distribution width (RDW) was significantly associated with 30- and 90-day mortality (p=0.003, 0.023 respectively), while higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was associated with increased 30-day and 5-year mortality (p= 0.036, 0.033 respectively).",
