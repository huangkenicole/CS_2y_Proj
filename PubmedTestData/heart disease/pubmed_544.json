        "Improved surgical care from the last five decades, together with the advances in medical management, led to a remarkable increase of survival of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). However, aging of the CHD population brings new challenges. Given that many patients with CHD are prone to residua and sequelae, life-long surveillance is essential. Therefore, the first of many challenges is to optimize the transition of patients with CHD from pediatric to adult cardiology to prevent lost to follow-up, and to ensure that there are enough specialized adult cardiologists to take care of this expanding patient population. Another important challenge is the expansion of knowledge on long-term complications and comorbidity in these patients. Increased efforts are needed to gain further understanding on how to prevent and treat these. Furthermore, as patients reach the reproductive age, family planning becomes more important and research on the risks and management of pregnancy should be further extended. Finally, to improve the well-being and social life of adults with CHD efforts should be made to improve employability and insurability."
