        "Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in Japan, North America and Europe. It is now being increasingly recognized from the developing countries as well. If not diagnosed and treated in time, KD can result in coronary artery abnormalities in approximately 15-25% cases. The long-term consequences of these abnormalities may manifest in adults as myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) remains the drug of choice for treatment of KD, but several new agents like infliximab, cyclosporine, glucocorticoids and statins are now being increasingly used in these patients. While echocardiography has been the preferred imaging modality hitherto, CT coronary angiography has emerged as an exciting new supplementary option and provides an entirely new dimension to this disease. The incidence of KD has shown a progressive increase in several countries and it is likely that this disease would impact public health programmes in the near future even in the developing countries."
