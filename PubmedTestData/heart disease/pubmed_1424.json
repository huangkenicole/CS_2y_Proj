        "In patients with congenital and acquired heart disease clinical applications of Two dimensional Doppler Echocardiography were discussed, and the literature was reviewed. Clinical applications and limitations in patients with congenital and acquired heart disease were discussed. Different views of the combined two-dimensional echo and pulsed wave Doppler transducer are proposed: The apical four chamber view was used to measure inflow velocities into both ventricles, the apical two chambers view to get signals from the left ventricular outflow tract (sometimes a suprasternal or a subxiphoidal approach was necessary). Right ventricular outflow was obtained from a short axis parasternal view. For the spectrum of the descending aorta a subxiphoidal cross sectional plane was used. The typical Doppler images for stenotic valves, regurgitations, shunts, coarctations and total anomalous pulmonary veins were shown. Calculations of stroke volume, flows, shunts and pressure-gradients were discussed. Potential misinterpretation sources as touching valves or walls by the sample volume, and wrong settings of filters and gain systems, as well as limitations of the equipment were described."
