        "Cardiac and pulmonary disease are so closely interrelated that it is often difficult to determine in young infants which is the primary offender. As illustrated in these case reports, failure to recognize the true nature of the disease process may lead to unnecessary procedures and delays which can be life-threatening. Statistically, the wheezing infant very likely is suffering from primary pulmonary disease; however, congenital cardiac abnormalities can cause pulmonary symptoms which completely dominate the clinical picture and lead to erroneous diagnoses. Although rare, the basis of cough and wheezing may be a vascular ring which encircles and compresses the trachea. Lesions associated with large left-to-right shunts, such as ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus, also can cause cough and wheezing because of bronchial compression by a large tense pulmonary artery and a distended left atrium. These same lesions also produce isolated left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous congestion and episodes of cough and wheezing. Anomalous pulmonary venour return, cor triatriatum, supravalvular mitral ring, or mitral stenosis are other lesions which can cause cough and wheezing secondary to pulmonary venous obstruction."
