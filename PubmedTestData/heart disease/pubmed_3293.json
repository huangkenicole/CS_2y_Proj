        "Postmortem findings within the cardiac conduction system are described from the case of a black woman with sarcoid heart disease who died suddenly. Her clinical course had been characterized by recurring ventricular arrhythmias and bouts of syncope. Both the sinus node artery and the atrioventricular (A-V) node artery were sites of focal fibromuscular dysplasia, which thickened slightly the wall of the former but markedly narrowed the lumen of the latter. Small foci of sarcoid infiltration were present in the sinus node and the A-V node. Fatty replacement within the His bundle was attributable to the probable ischemia caused by narrowing of the A-V node artery. Sarcoid granulomata and infiltration with epithelioid cells were present throughout the ventricular myocardium, but were conspicuously less prevalent in the atria. All the large coronary arteries were normal. Many small coronary arteries in the ventricular myocardium were involved by the sarcoidosis and their lumen were narrowed. These findings and analogous ones reported by others are discussed relative to the pathogenesis of syncopal attacks and sudden death which seem to peculiarly prevalent in sarcoid heart disease."
