        "Diastolic heart failure is common, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. Although it does not contribute to heart failure mortality to the same degree as systolic dysfunction, it is responsible for significant morbidity. Clinical suspicion is a prerequisite to the diagnosis, which should be considered in all patients with exercise intolerance due to dyspnoea, particularly if associated with a history of ischaemic heart disease or hypertension. Although invasive haemodynamic studies are the gold standard investigation, this method of assessment is limited to a very small proportion of these patients, and echocardiography remains the single most useful investigation. It is important to realize that the management of diastolic heart disease depends to a large extent on the aetiology, which contrasts with the treatment of systolic dysfunction. As indicated, a wide variety of different drugs may potentially be of benefit, although considerable further research will be needed to more clearly define this heterogenous condition and its optimal treatment."
