        "The many responsibilities of primary care, cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is a growing concern. Demanding standards have been given to primary care in the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease. This article reports an evaluation of an intervention to support primary care service providers in this responsibility. A part-time specialist nurse and a part-time exercise worker were appointed to work in a group of 11 GP practices in a primary care trust in a city in the north of England. The evaluation component reported here is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals on secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Interviews were conducted with 18 primary care staff from practices in both intervention (n = 11) and control (n = 11) groups. The evaluation revealed support for the development of nurse-led clinics, increased confidence and skills development among practice nurses, but some concern about competing demands on practice nurses' time. Primary healthcare professionals found their resources stretched by competing demands on their time from government initiatives."
