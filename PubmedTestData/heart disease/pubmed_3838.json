        "<b>Introduction</b>: Disturbances in myocardial lipid metabolism are increasingly being recognized as drivers of the development and progression of heart disease. Therefore, there is a need for treatments that can directly target lipid metabolic defects in heart failure. The membrane-associated glycoprotein CD36 plays a pivotal role in governing myocardial lipid metabolism by mediating lipid signaling and facilitating the cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids. Emerging evidence suggests that CD36 is a prominent target in the treatment of heart failure.<b>Areas covered</b>: This article provides an overview of the key role of CD36 for proper contractile functioning of a healthy heart, its implications in the development of cardiac disease (ischemia/reperfusion, cardiac hypertrophy, and diabetic cardiomyopathy), and its application as a target to normalize cardiac metabolism as part of so-called metabolic modulation therapy.<b>Expert opinion</b>: CD36 appears a promising and effective therapeutic target in the treatment of heart failure. Natural compounds and chemical agents known to alter the amount or subcellular distribution of CD36 or inhibit its functioning, should be evaluated for their potency to correct cardiac metabolism and cure heart disease."
