        "Background Recognizing the etiology of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) has an enormous impact on the management of victims and their immediate families. A significant proportion of SCA survivors with a structurally normal heart are not offered a diagnosis and there is no clear consensus on the type and duration of follow-up. We aimed to assess the utility of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing diagnosis of cardiac arrest etiology during follow-up. Methods and Results We retrospectively assessed 327 consecutive SCA survivors (mean age 61.9\u00b116.2\u00a0years, 80% men) who underwent secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators between May 2015 and November 2018. The initial diagnosis was recorded at the time of admission and follow-up diagnosis was deduced from subsequent clinic records, investigations, and outcomes of multidisciplinary team meetings. Structural heart disease accounted for 282 (86%) of SCAs. Forty-five (14%) patients had a structurally normal heart and underwent comprehensive testing and follow-up (mean duration 93\u00b152\u00a0weeks). On initial evaluation, 14/45 (31%) of these received a diagnosis, rising to 29/45 (64%) with serial reviews during follow-up. Discussion in multidisciplinary team meetings and imaging reassessment accounted for 47% of new diagnoses. No additional diagnoses were made beyond 96\u00a0weeks. Nineteen (5.8%) fatalities occurred in the entire cohort, exclusively in patients with structural heart disease. Conclusions Systematic comprehensive testing combined with multidisciplinary expert team review of SCA survivors without structural heart disease improves the yield and time to diagnosis compared with previously published studies. This approach has positive implications in the management of SCA survivors and their families."
