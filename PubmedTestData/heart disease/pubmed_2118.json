        "Recognizing heart disease is relevant to oncologists because cancer patients are at an increased risk of cardiac mortality due to shared risk factors and the adverse effects of cancer therapy. This study assessed the extent to which the measurement of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) aids in the diagnosis of heart disease in addition to a history of coronary artery disease and the presence of atrial fibrillation (composite test). The NT- proBNP cutoff value was 100 pg/ml.",
        "A series of 583 consecutive cancer patients (68.4 \u00b1 11.0 years) who were referred because of cardiac or pulmonary symptoms prospectively underwent a diagnostic work-up. Heart disease was diagnosed if at least one of the following conditions was present: (a) history of coronary artery disease, (b) atrial fibrillation, (c) impaired left ventricular systolic function, (d) significant valvular disease, (e) pulmonary hypertension, or (f) left ventricular hypertrophy.",
        "Except for (a), all 6 conditions were associated with NT-proBNP >100 pg/ml. The sensitivity/specificity values of the composite test were 0.92/0.50 for any heart disease. Several extracardiac covariates were associated with NT-proBNP >100 pg/ml, which contributed to the low test specificity.",
        "The low specificity of NT-proBNP limits its value for the diagnosis of heart disease in cancer patients."
