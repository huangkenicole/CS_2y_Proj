        "Focal deficits, seizures and epilepsy, altered consciousness, and disturbed behaviours can complicate heart diseases and their medical treatment as well as cardiological procedures and cardiac surgery. Neurological complications of common cardiac conditions are discussed. These cardiac conditions are acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, valvular heart diseases, infective endocarditis, congenital heart disease, invasive cardiological procedures and cardiac surgery. As transient ischaemic attack, stroke, seizures and epilepsy are the most common neurological complications, their management is also reviewed. Precautions should be taken to prevent neurological complications of heart disease. Regular surveillance for these complications would allow early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management."
