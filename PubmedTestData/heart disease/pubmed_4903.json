        "To investigate the factors which effect maternal-fetal outcomes in pregnant women complicated with organic heart disease.",
        "Clinical data of 62 pregnant cases with either rheumatic or congenital heart diseases, collected from Beijing Anzhen Hospital during 1985-1994, were analysed retrospectively.",
        "The prevalence of organic heart diseases in total pregnant women during the same period was 0.97%. No significant difference was found in maternal-fetal complications between the two types of heart diseases. However, the incidences of maternal heart failure, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation were significantly higher in patients without previous surgical treatment as compared with those with previous surgical therapy, and were also higher in patients with heart function of grade III-IV in comparison with those with grade I-II.",
        "Patients with organic heart diseases should be treated and operated on in order to achieve grade I-II heart function before pregnancy. Cesarean section is the better choice of delivery."
