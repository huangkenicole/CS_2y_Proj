        "To investigate the value of iodine-131 therapy for hyperthyroidism complicated hyperthyroid heart disease(HHD) induced by Graves' disease or Plummer disease.",
        "Totally 40 HHD cases who were confirmed in our department from 2009 to 2010 were enrolled in this study. All patients received serum thyroid hormones and associated antibodies tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and/or thyroid imaging before and after iodine-131 therapy to access the treatment effectiveness.",
        "Among 31 patients with HHD due to Graves' disease and 9 due to Plummer disease, iodine-131 treatment resulted in euthyroidism in 15 and 5 patients and hypothyroid in 7 and 2 patients, while 9 and 2 remain hyperthyroid, respectively.Serum free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were statistically significant(P<0.05) before and after iodine-131 therapy, while no significant difference for serum thyrotrophin receptor antibody, antithyroid peroxidase autoantibody, and anti-thyroglobulin antibody.Atrial fibrillation was the most common cardiac complication of hyperthyroidism(n=25, 62.5%) .The remission rate after iodine-131 treatment was 76.0%.",
