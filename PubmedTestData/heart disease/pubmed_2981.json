        "Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death among U.S. adults. Adults with diabetes have a twofold to fourfold greater risk for dying from cardiovascular diseases than adults without diabetes. In addition, although the annual incidence of deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases declined substantially among U.S. adults during 1970-1994, it decreased less among those with diabetes. To compare the prevalence of heart disease and stroke among adults with and without diabetes, CDC analyzed data from the 1999-2001 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that the age-adjusted prevalence of heart disease and stroke is approximately two to three times greater among adults with diabetes than among adults without diabetes. Increased efforts are needed to prevent diabetes and reduce the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., hypertension and high cholesterol) in the United States, particularly among adults with diabetes."
