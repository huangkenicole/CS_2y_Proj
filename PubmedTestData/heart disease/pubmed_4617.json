        "Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a significant cause of morbidity in breast and other mediastinal cancers. The many molecular and cellular patho-mechanisms that have a role in RIHD are not completely understood. Endothelial injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial damage, are considered the primary causes of RIHD. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death that results from irondependent lipid peroxide accumulation. As ferroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, it seems that it has a significant effect on RIHD. It was recently shown that ionizing radiation (IR) generates severe ferroptosis, which is a critical component of Radiotherapy-mediated normal cell toxicity. These findings support the use of a ferroptosis inhibitor to reduce RIHD. In this perspective review, we summarize the role of ferroptosis in pathogens of cardiovascular disease and radiation toxicity, and we will introduce ferroptosis inhibitors as a new strategy to prevent or reduce RIHD."
