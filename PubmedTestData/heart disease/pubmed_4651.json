        "Atrial fibrillation or flutter is frequently inducible during endocavitary or transesophageal electrophysiologic study. However, its clinic and prognostic significance has not yet been clarified. We studied 443 patients: 276 underwent endocavitary electrophysiologic study, 228 underwent transesophageal electrophysiologic study and 61 underwent both methods. In 343 of them a satisfactory echocardiogram was obtained. Patients were divided in three groups: gr. I, 93 patients with documented episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter; gr. II, 257 patients with or without heart disease without clinical atrial fibrillation or flutter; gr. III, 93 symptomatic or asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients without clinical atrial fibrillation or flutter. Gr. I included patients without overt heart disease (20), with WPW (11), mitral valve prolapse (4), and miscellaneous (58). Gr. II included patients without overt heart disease (49), with concealed Kent bundles (7), Mahaim (1) or James fibers (1) mitral valve prolapse (6), sick sinus syndrome (40), miscellaneous (91), or syncope of an unknown origin (62). Atrial vulnerability was evaluated both by endocavitary and transesophageal electrophysiologic study using two different protocols; the first protocol was moderately aggressive (prot. A), while the second was aggressive (prot. B). Endocavitary electrophysiologic study. Prot. A: single and double extrastimuli at the three heart rates (sinus, 100 and 150/m'), 10/m' incremental atrial pacing from 160 to 250/m; prot. B: prot. A + incremental atrial pacing from 260/m' up to 2:1 St-A block. Transesophageal electrophysiologic study. Prot. A: 10\" atrial burst at 100-600/m' prot. B: prot. A + 6-9\" increasing rate bursts from 200 to 800/m'. End point of all protocols: initiation of greater than 1' atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.",
        "Endocavitary electrophysiologic study. A greater than 1' atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter was induced with the two protocols respectively in 67% (52/78) and 85% (51/60) of gr. I, in 17% (26/150) and 36% (38/105) of gr. II and in 35% (17/48) and 44% (21/48) of gr. III (gr. I vs gr. II p less than 0.001 for prot. A and p less than 0.01 for prot. B; gr. II vs gr. III p less than 0.001 for prot. A and NS for prot. B). Induced atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter using the two protocols had a greater than 5' duration respectively in 83 and 78% of gr. I, 62 and 42% of gr. II and in 41 and 38% of gr. III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
