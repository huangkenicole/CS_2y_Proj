        "Radiation therapy (RT) is a very important part of multimodality cancer therapy. Addition of RT improves survival in many cancers, but there are some accompaniments of radiation. One of them is radiation induced heart disease (RIHD). RT for mediastinal lymphoma, breast, lung and oesophageal cancer is associated with the development of RIHD. The problem can be intensified with the addition of chemotherapy. Therapeutic modalities for RIHD are the same as in the non-irradiated population. However, surgery may be difficult in the irradiated patients. The long latent period is the reason why RIHD is not extensively studied. Survival of cancer patients has improved over past few decades, so RIHD is a growing concern especially in younger patients. In this review article, we have discussed the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and management of RIHD along with impact of chemotherapeutic agents."
