        "Quantitative one-plane cineangiocardiography in right anterior oblique position for evaluation of LV performance was carried out in 62 patients with various heart diseases and in 13 subjects with normal LV. Parameters for evaluating both pump and muscle performances were derived from volume and pressure measurements. Of 31 patients with either systolic hypertension or LV myocardial diseases (coronary artery disease or idiopathic cardiomyopathy), 14 had clinical evidence of LV failure before the study. It was found that mean VCF and EF were most sensitive indicators of impaired LV performance among the various parameters. There was a close correlation between mean VCF and EF, yet discordant changes of both parameters were noted in some patients. Furthermore, wall motion abnormalities were not infrequently observed in patients with coronary artery disease or primary cardiomyopathy. Therefore, assessment of at least three ejection properties (EF, mean VCF and wall motion abnormalities) are considered to be essential for full understanding of derangement of LV function in heart disease. This is especially true of patients with coronary artery disease. LV behavior in relation to different pathological stresses or lesions, such as chronic pressure or volume load, myocardial disease and mitral stenosis, was also studied and possible cause of impaired LV myocardial function in mitral stenosis was discussed."
