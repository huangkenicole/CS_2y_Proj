        "Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, are the most potent and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of human cancers, including solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, their clinical use is hampered by severe cardiotoxic side effects and cancer therapy-related heart disease has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors. The identification of therapeutic strategies limiting anthracycline cardiotoxicity with preserved antitumor efficacy thus represents the current challenge of cardio-oncologists. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity has been originally ascribed to the ability of this class of drugs to disrupt iron metabolism and generate excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, small clinical trials with iron chelators and anti-oxidants failed to provide any benefit and suggested that doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is not solely due to redox cycling. New emerging explanations include anthracycline-dependent regulation of major signaling pathways controlling DNA damage response, cardiomyocyte survival, cardiac inflammation, energetic stress and gene expression modulation. This review will summarize recent studies unraveling the complex web of mechanisms of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity, and identifying new druggable players for the prevention of heart disease in cancer patients. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte Biology: Integration of Developmental and Environmental Cues in the Heart edited by Marcus Schaub and Hughes Abriel."
