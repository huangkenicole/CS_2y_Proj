        "Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for heart failure. Diabetic heart damage is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS generation. However, clinical trials have shown no effects of antioxidant therapies on heart failure in diabetic patients, suggesting that simply antagonizing existing ROS by antioxidants is not sufficient to reduce diabetic cardiac injury. A potentially more effective treatment strategy may be to enhance the overall capacity of mitochondrial quality control to maintain a pool of healthy mitochondria that are needed for supporting cardiac contractile function in diabetic patients. Mitochondrial quality is controlled by a number of coordinated mechanisms including mitochondrial fission and fusion, mitophagy and biogenesis. The mitochondrial damage consistently observed in the diabetic hearts indicates a failure of the mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. Recent studies have demonstrated a crucial role for each of these mechanisms in cardiac homeostasis and have begun to interrogate the relative contribution of insufficient mitochondrial quality control to diabetic cardiac injury. In this review, we will present currently available literature that links diabetic heart disease to the dysregulation of major mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. We will discuss the functional roles of these mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetic heart disease and their potentials for targeted therapeutical manipulation."
