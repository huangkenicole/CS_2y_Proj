        "Heart disease such as myocardial infarction is the first cause of mortality in all countries. Today, cardiac cell-based therapy using de novo produced cardiac cells is considered as a novel approach for cardiac regenerative medicine. Recently, an alchemy-like approach, known as direct reprogramming or direct conversion, has been developed to directly convert somatic cells to cardiac cells in vitro and in vivo. This cellular alchemy is a short-cut and safe strategy for generating autologous cardiac cells, and it can be accomplished through activating cardiogenesis- or pluripotency-related factors in noncardiac cells. Importantly, pluripotency factors-based direct cardiac conversion, known as partial reprogramming, is shorter and more efficient for cardiomyocyte generation in vitro. Today, this strategy is achievable for direct conversion of mouse and human somatic cells to cardiac lineage cells (cardiomyocytes and cardiac progenitor cells), using transgene free, chemical-based approaches. Although, heart-specific partial reprogramming seems to be challenging for in vivo conversion of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiac cells, but whole organism-based in vivo partial reprogramming ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and prolongs lifespan in mouse. Notably, cardiac cells produced using partial reprogramming strategy can be a useful platform for disease modeling, drug screening and cardiac cell-based therapy, once the safety issues are overcome. Herein, we discuss about all progresses in de novo production of cardiac cells using partial reprogramming-based direct conversion, as well as give an overview about the potential applications of this strategy in vivo and in vitro."
