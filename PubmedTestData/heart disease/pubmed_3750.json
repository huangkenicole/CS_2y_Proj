        "Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries, including Lebanon. The continuing advances in the treatment of heart disease have improved patient outcomes significantly over the years. Nevertheless, prompt treatment remains essential to treatment success, which depends on the person's early recognition of cardiac symptoms and quick seeking of care.",
        "The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between knowledge of symptoms of heart disease, perceived cardiac risk and the potential response to a heart attack in a sample of Lebanese adults.",
        "A cross sectional descriptive survey design was used. A convenience sample of 399 adult hospital visitors who did not have heart disease were interviewed in two major referral hospitals in Beirut.",
        "The Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used; in addition an open-ended question was asked to elicit what the visitor would do in case he/she experienced cardiac symptoms.",
        "While most participants (94%) correctly recognized major symptoms of heart disease (like chest pain and dyspnea), they also reported irrelevant symptoms to be associated with heart disease (like irritability by 68% and muscle cramps by 52%). Only 21% of participants reported that they would seek emergency care as their first response if they were experiencing a heart attack. Knowledge of symptoms and perceived cardiac risk were not associated with the response to a heart attack. Being single was the only significant predictor of choosing the appropriate response when experiencing a cardiac event.",
        "The findings suggest lack of adequate knowledge of cardiac symptoms and a high potential for inappropriate responses when symptoms occur. Public health heart health campaigns are needed to raise awareness about heart disease in Lebanon."
