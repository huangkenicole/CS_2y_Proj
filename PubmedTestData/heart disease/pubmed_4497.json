        "This article is the first of two looking at health promotion projects which go some way towards meeting the targets set out in 'The Health of the Nation' White Paper. In an attempt to encourage healthier lifestyles that reduce the risk of heart disease, a project was set up in an inner city area of Staffordshire using the Look After Your Heart approach. Ten people took part in ten sessions which each covered aspects of exercise, a subject related to healthy living and relaxation. At the end of the course, the participants felt they had benefited from the course and six months later several were still maintaining their lifestyle changes."
