        "The purpose of this study was to calculate the burden of 3 major diseases (cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease [CVD]) using the cost of illness (COI) method.",
        "As a modification of the original COI method developed by Rice, the estimated comprehensive COI (C-COI) of cancer, heart disease, and CVD were redefined. C-COI consists of medical direct, morbidity, and mortality costs (MtCs; components of the original COI); long-term care (LTC) direct cost (DC); and family burden (FB). LTC DC is an insurance benefit, and FB is the unpaid care cost incurred by the family, relatives, and friends for in-home and in-community medical expenses (opportunity cost). All costs for 2008-2014 were calculated using official statistics of the Japanese government.",
        "The C-COI of cancer, heart disease, and CVD in 2014 amounted to 9815 billion Japanese yen (JPY), 4461 billion JPY, and 6501 billion JPY, respectively. As for the composition of the C-COI, the MtC accounted for the largest portion of medical expenses for treatment of cancer (63.5%) and heart disease (50.6%), but the DC (LTC) accounted for the largest portion of medical expenses for CVD (26.7%).",
        "This study, based on government statistics, demonstrated that C-COI, including LTC DC and FB, could be estimated, and the latter was found to be a major cost component in CVD, whereas long-term disability is a salient feature of the disease."
