        "We sought to measure plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentrations in normal dogs and to compare them with those measured in dogs with acquired heart disease with or without pulmonary edema. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was validated and used to measure ET-1 immunoreactivity in plasma samples obtained from 32 normal dogs and 46 dogs with either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 27) or degenerative valvular disease (CDVD, n = 19) with (n = 30) or without (n = 16) overt congestive heart failure (CHF). Plasma ET-1 concentrations (geometric mean, 95% confidence interval of geometric mean) were 1.17 (1.04-1.32) fmol/mL in the 32 normal control dogs, 1.25 (0.981-1.60) fmol/mL in 16 dogs with DCM (n = 9) or CDVD (n = 7) without CHF, and 2.51 (2.10-3.01) fmol/mL in 30 dogs with DCM (n = 18) and CDVD (n = 12) with CHE Plasma immunoreactivity of ET-1 was significantly higher in dogs with CHF in comparison with normal dogs (P < .001) and dogs with heart disease without CHF (P < .001). No significant difference was found between normal dogs and dogs with heart disease but without CHF (P > .05). Significant correlations were between plasma ET-I concentrations and left atrial:aortic ratio (P < .0001, r2 = .39), left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole indexed to aortic diameter (P < .0001, r2 = .30) or body surface area (BSA) (P = .0071, r2 = .10), and left ventricular internal dimension at end-systole indexed to aortic diameter (P = .0003, r- = .17) or BSA (P = .0008, r2 = .15)."
