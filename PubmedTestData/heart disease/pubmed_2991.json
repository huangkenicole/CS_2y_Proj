        "None.",
        "A total of 190 neonates met inclusion criteria during this 1-yr period, of which 146 (77%) had at least one surgical procedure. Single ventricle heart disease was present in 42%. The most common mode of presentation was following a prenatal diagnosis (53%), followed by diagnosis in the newborn nursery (38%) and diagnosis after newborn hospital discharge (8%). The most common presenting findings in the newborn nursery were isolated murmur (38%) or cyanosis (32%), while circulatory collapse (38%) was the most common presentation after discharge. For the entire study cohort, 13% had a known genetic syndrome, 23% had a major noncardiac congenital anomaly, and 16% weighed < 2.5 kg. The hospital mortality for the entire cohort was 7.4%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality included younger age at admission, higher number of cardiopulmonary bypass runs, and need for postoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Total hospital length of stay was > 1 month in 17% of neonates.",
        "In patients with complex congenital heart disease, including nearly half with single ventricle heart disease, neonatal hospital mortality was 7%. These patients have a high frequency of multiple congenital anomalies, genetic syndromes, low birth weight, and prolonged length of stay."
