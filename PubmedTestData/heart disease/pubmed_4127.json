        "This study sought to determine the cause of recurrent syncope and clinical outcomes by using the head-up\u00a0tilt test (HUTT) and an insertable loop recorder (ILR) in patients with structural heart disease (SHD) and negative electrophysiology study (EPS) results.",
        "Patients with syncope and SHD with negative EPS findings have a low risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, the cause of recurrent syncope and the outcomes in these patients are not well characterized.",
        "This prospective study evaluated syncope patients with SHD and negative EPS results by using HUTT (with sublingual nitroglycerine [NTG] provocation as needed) and ILR. A total of 41 SHD patients (27 patients [66%] had coronary arterial disease, and 14 patients [34.15%] had dilated cardiomyopathy with mean EF of 42 \u00b1 4.8% [range 30% to 49%]) were included.",
        "HUTT findings were positive in 25 patients (61%) in group A and negative in 16 patients (39%) in group B. An ILR was implanted in 21 of 25 group A patients (84%) and in 12 of 16 group B patients (75%), and they were followed for 15 \u00b1 8 months. During follow-up, 17 of 21 patients (81%) in group A and 5 of 12 patients (41.7%) in group B had ILR evidence consistent with reflex syncope. One group B patient had documented atrioventricular block and underwent pacemaker implantation. There were no malignant ventricular arrhythmias or deaths on follow-up.",
        "Reflex syncope is the most common cause of syncope and accounts for approximately 60% of cases in patients with SHD, negative EPS results, left ventricular systolic dysfunction with left ventricular EF >30%, and not in heart failure."
