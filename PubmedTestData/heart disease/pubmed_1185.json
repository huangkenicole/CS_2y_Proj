        "Persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have much higher heart disease mortality rates than the general population. The objective was to compare the general population with persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychiatric disorders in terms of rates of somatic hospitalization and invasive heart disease procedures, and in terms of heart disease mortality during the period 1994 to 2006. Survival analysis was used to analyze heart disease mortality and somatic care trends in a cohort of all persons residing in Denmark. During the study period, heart disease mortality rose significantly among persons with schizophrenia: compared with the general population, the rise in the mortality rate ratio equalled 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.15) every second year. This was not the case for persons with bipolar disorder [1.02 (0.98-1.05), not significant] or other psychiatric disorders [1.00 (0.99-1.01), not significant]. The entire period saw a lower hospitalization rate and fewer invasive cardiac procedures among persons with schizophrenia than among the general population. The higher mortality (with increasing trends) from heart disease in persons with schizophrenia compared to the rest of the cohort members can be explained partly by low rates of invasive cardiac procedures. However, other reasons, such as antipsychotic-induced weight gain, primary prevention, and difficulty following smoking cessation advice could also be part of the explanation. The results call for a greater focus on improvement in somatic care and lifestyle factors for this group of patients."
