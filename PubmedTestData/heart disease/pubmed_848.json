        "As the Shanghai Obstetrical Cardiology Intensive Care Center, our hospital has accumulated a large number of clinical data of pregnant women with heart disease. This paper is a retrospective analysis of 1142 pregnancies in women with heart disease so as to evaluate the maternal and fetal outcomes of these patients.",
        "A retrospective analysis was carried out for pregnancies in 1142 women with heart disease who delivered in Shanghai Obstetrical Cardiology Intensive Care Center between 1993 and 2007.",
        "In this study, main heart diseases in pregnancy were arrhythmia (n = 359, 31.4%), congenital heart disease (CHD; n = 291, 25.5%), and myocarditis and its sequelae (n = 284, 24.9%); based on the functional classification criteria of New York Heart Association (NYHA), more than half (n = 678, 59.4%) of patients were classified NYHA Class I; pregnant women in NHYA Class I-II (n = 951, 83.3%) commonly had arrhythmia, myocarditis and its sequelae, while those in NHYA Class III-IV (n = 191, 16.7%) mainly had CHD, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), cardiopathy induced by hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM). Cardiac failure occurred in 97 (8.5%) patients, and 8 (0.7%) maternal deaths and 12 (1.1%) perinatal deaths were reported in this study. Compared with those in NHYA Class I-II, women in NHYA Class III-IV had a significantly lower gestational age at birth (P < 0.05), lower birth weight (P < 0.01), and higher incidence of preterm delivery, small for gestational age and perinatal death (P < 0.01). The incidence of cardiac failure in pregnant women with cardiopathy induced by hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy and PPCM was relatively high, with a rate of 80% and 52.2%, respectively. After cardiac operation, 131 (90.3%) women were in classified NHYA Class I-II and 14 (9.7%) in NHYA Class III-IV.",
        "Arrhythmia is the type of heart disease that has a highest incidence in patients with heart disease in pregnancy, while main types of heart disease that impair cardiac function are CHD and RHD; cardiac failure is more frequently caused by cardiopathy induced by hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy and PPCM; impaired cardiac function increases perinatal morbidity; cardiac surgery before pregnancy could improve the cardiac function."
