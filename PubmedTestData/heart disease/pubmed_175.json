        "Poor quality and quantity maternal nutrition during pregnancy exerts permanent and damaging effects on the heart of the developing fetus. The developmental origin of adult heart disease is considered an important and critical factor in the pathogenesis of myocardial abnormalities in later life. Low birth mass, a marker of intrauterine stress, has been linked to a predisposition to heart disease. In this article, our work on the impact of exposure to a low-protein diet, in utero, on the developing heart and its long-term consequences are discussed. Other studies providing some supportive evidence are also described. It is proposed that normal fetal nutrition, growth, and development through efficient maternal nutrition (as well as other predisposing factors) before and during pregnancy may serve as a strategy for the primary prevention of heart disease."
