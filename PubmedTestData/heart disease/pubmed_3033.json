        "This chapter looks at the evolution over fifty years of government recommendations for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease amongst the British population. It also explores how non-governmental organisations such as the BMA established their own nutritional advice giving mechanisms and tried to influence such recommendations--and how networks of scientists constituted advisory committees. Scientists tended to favour recommendations which would lead to interventions within the scope of their own disciplines. It was also the case that consensus was lacking for a long while; this was only arrived at during the end of the period under consideration."
