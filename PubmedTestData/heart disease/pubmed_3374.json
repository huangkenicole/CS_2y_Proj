        "Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a common radiotherapy complication. Reducing radiation exposure and post-irradiation antioxidant therapy are promising approaches. Here, a liquid metal-based core-shell nanomedicine (LMN) composed of a gallium core and a multifunctional polymeric shell with radiopaque, X-ray shielding, and X-ray-responsive antioxidation properties for preventive therapy of RIHD is developed. The liquid metal provides radiopaque properties to enhance X-ray and computed tomography imaging and attenuate radiation to prevent primary myocardial damage. Under X-ray radiation, cleavage of the diselenide bond on the polymeric shell results in the release of LMN and controlled antioxidation. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that LMN significantly reduces myocardial injury and impaired cardiac function, stabilizes mitochondrial function, and inhibits myocardial fibrosis. This nanomedicine with radiographic contrast, radiation shielding, and responsive features provides a new strategy for the prevention of radiation-related diseases."
