        "Oxidative stress has been widely recognized to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary disorders. In ischemic heart diseases, it is involved not only in the development of atherosclerosis but also in ongoing ischemic injury, especially in the reperfusion process. Cardiomyopathy is another cardiac disorder in which oxidative stress is involved. In diabetic cardiomyopathy, homocysteine, a well-known source of oxidative stress, is believed to play major roles in its development. Thioredoxin (TRX) is a redox-acting protein ubiquitously present in the human body. It also is inducible by a wide variety of oxidative stresses. TRX is a multifunctional protein and has anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, as well as antioxidative effects. It is therefore feasible to think that TRX is a potential therapy for cardiac disease. Moreover, serum TRX is a well-recognized biomarker of various diseases involving oxidative stress, and this is also the case for cardiac disorders. Here we discuss how TRX is useful as a biomarker of and therapeutic agent for cardiopulmonary disorders, especially focusing on ischemic heart disease, myocarditis and oxygen sensing, and acute respiratory distress syndrome."
