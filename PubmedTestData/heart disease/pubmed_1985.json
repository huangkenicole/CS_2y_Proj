        "Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease is necessary and considered to be a difficult attempt to treat a patient effectively before a heart attack occurs. According to recent studies, heart disease is said to be one of the leading origins of death worldwide. Early identification of CHD can assist to reduce death rates. When it comes to prediction using traditional methodologies, the difficulty arises in the intricacy of the data and relationships. This research is aimed at applying recent machine learning technology to identify heart disease from past medical data to uncover correlations in data that can greatly improve the accuracy of prediction rates using various machine learning models. Models have been implemented using naive Bayes, random forest algorithms, and the combinations of two models such as naive Bayes and random forest methods. These methods offer numerous attributes associated with heart disease. This proposed system foresees the chance of rising heart disease. The proposed system uses 14 parameters such as age, sex, quick blood sugar, chest discomfort, and other medical parameters which are used in the proposed system. Our proposed systems find the probability of developing heart disease in percentages as well as the accuracy level (accuracy of 93%). Finally, this proposed method will support the doctors to analyze the heart patients competently."
