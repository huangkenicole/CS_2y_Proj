        "Heart disease (HD) in pregnancy remains a major cause of non-obstetric maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study describes the outcome in 164 pregnant women with HD (158 deliveries in women in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes 1 and 2; 17 in NYHA Classes 3 and 4) who received good antenatal care and benefitted from a specific protocol and experience of a dedicated staff. There were no maternal or neonatal deaths; 46 women were diagnosed peripartum. Based on a sub-division into NYHA categories, and when sub-divided by HD, there were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to maternal age, gestational age at admission or at delivery, birth weight, 5 min Apgar scores, mode of delivery (caesarean delivery), senior obstetric/anaesthesiology staff in attendance or delivery during day/working hours. There was a higher incidence of pre-term deliveries in women with rheumatic heart disease and Marfan syndrome (p = 0.06) relative to others. Babies of women with coronary heart disease had prolonged postpartum course in the NICU (p = 0.0001) and longer total hospital stays for the mother. In conclusion, well-managed, motivated mothers with HD who benefit from comprehensive antenatal care, and are managed primarily by their obstetric and anaesthesia teams, can aspire to a good outcome for themselves and their babies."
