        "In this chapter we have presented our experience with endomyocardial biopsy. We have presented a scheme that we find helpful not only in our thought processes regarding diagnosis but also regarding pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment. Because of our research interests and the orientation of our institution, our patient population is weighted heavily towards myocarditis, and myocarditis has received a prominent place in this chapter. Other cardiac pathologists may utilize slightly different schemes which work equally well for them and their cardiology colleagues. We believe that with practice, our scheme should be useful to pathologists without extensive experience with cardiac biopsies. The great majority of disease entities that a practicing pathologist will see are presented here but, by no means, is this meant to be an exhaustive review of all cardiac pathology diagnosable by endomyocardial biopsy. The endomyocardial biopsy is now an established diagnostic procedure. All general pathologists as well as cardiac pathologists should have a good working knowledge of its applications and limitations."
