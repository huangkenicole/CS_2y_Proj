        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were first generated 10 years ago. Their ability to differentiate into any somatic cell type of the body including cardiomyocytes has already made them a valuable resource for modelling cardiac disease and drug screening. Initially human iPSCs were used mostly to model known disease phenotypes; more recently, and despite a number of recognised shortcomings, they have proven valuable in providing fundamental insights into the mechanisms of inherited heart disease with unknown genetic cause using surprisingly small cohorts. In this review, we summarise the progress made with human iPSCs as cardiac disease models with special focus on the latest mechanistic insights and related challenges. Furthermore, we suggest emerging solutions that will likely move the field forward."
