        "In order to assess the prevalence of cardiac involvement in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAS), a syndrome which associates thromboembolism, recurrent abortion, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombocytopenia, transthoracic (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed in 15 patients, 10 women and 5 men with a mean age of 38.8 +/- 11 years, with the PAS but without systemic lupus erythematosus. The presentation of the PAS was a thrombotic event (6 arterial and 7 venous) in 13 cases, and recurrent abortion in 3 cases. Twelve patients had high anticardiolipin antibody levels (> or = 15 U GPL) and 12 had a raised anti-prothrombinase antibody title. Valvular heart disease was detected in 9 patients (60%) as a valve thickening (> or = 5 mm for the mitral and > or = 3 mm for the aortic valve) or nodule. Mitral regurgitation was observed in 4 cases both on TTE and TEE and was mild in 3 cases and severe in 1 case. Aortic regurgitation was diagnosed in 6 patients, in 3 cases by TTE and in 6 cases by TEE. It was mild in 5 cases and moderate in the other cases. Pericardial effusion was observed in 3 patients (20%), alone in 1 case and associated with valvular disease in the other two cases. No abnormality of left ventricular systolic or diastolic function could be demonstrated. In conclusion, cardiac involvement seems to be common in the PAS, and TEE is a sensitive and accurate method for describing the valvular, especially aortic valve, abnormalities."
