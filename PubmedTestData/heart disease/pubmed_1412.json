        "The aim of this study was to determine whether measurement of plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an efficacious method to predict patients with heart disease irrespective of left ventricular function in a multiphasic health screening program. We have examined whether patients with various heart disease selected by physical examination, ECG, and chest X-rays can be identified by plasma levels of ANP and BNP. We examined 481 consecutive subjects who visited our checkup clinic for a multiphasic health screening test. By routine methods, among the 481 subjects, 13 were found to have some form of heart disease (old myocardial infarction, 2; cardiomyopathy, 2; valvular heart disease, 2; hypertensive heart disease, 5, and lone atrial fibrillation, 2). Sensitivity, specificity, and quintile analysis for identification of the patients with heart disease were determined by various cutoff levels of plasma ANP and BNP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for the identification of these patients. A plasma BNP level of 40 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 92% for heart disease detection. The area under the ROC curve for BNP was significantly greater than that for ANP (0.94 vs. 0.81; p < 0.001). A plasma BNP level of 13 pg/ml or less gave a 100% negative prediction value for heart disease. Plasma BNP concentration is a useful biochemical marker for the screening of asymptomatic patients with heart disease due to various etiologies from large population samples."
