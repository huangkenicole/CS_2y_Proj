        "People's beliefs about heart disease affect how quickly they respond to a cardiac event and their subsequent recovery.",
        "To explore beliefs about symptoms, causes, timeline, consequences and curability of heart disease in Lebanese adults; and to identify differences in these beliefs by demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk status.",
        "A total of 401 visitors of patients admitted to two hospitals in Beirut were interviewed using the modified Illness Perception Questionnaire, in addition to demographic and health-related questions. Participants were 25 years and older, visiting patients hospitalised for 7 days or less and had no history of coronary artery disease (CAD).",
        "Participants were mostly young (56.2% < 40 years of age), married (61.3%), women (57.9%), with at least secondary education (69%). The majority of participants perceived heart disease to be a chronic illness, with serious consequences. Eighty per cent identified the most common symptoms and causes of CAD. Over 80% believed that CAD can be controlled by lifestyle but 57.67% doubted complete recovery from a heart attack. Younger, single individuals and those with higher socioeconomic status perceived significantly stronger control than older, married and lower socioeconomic status participants. Smokers and diabetics perceived lower control over CAD than their counterparts. Participants with family history of CAD considered it more chronic than those without history.",
        "The findings reflect knowledge of symptoms and causes of CAD, but inconsistent beliefs about its control. Educational campaigns are needed to dispel misconceptions."
