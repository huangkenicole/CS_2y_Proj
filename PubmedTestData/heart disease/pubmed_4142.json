        "Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is one of the most promising methods for the diagnosis of cardiac disease. Left and right ventricular size and function are currently evaluated with 2D echocardiography. However, for unpredictable asymmetry of the chamber geometry, conventional 2D echocardiography cannot be used to accurately determine absolute chamber volumes and ejection fraction. As for valvular heart diseases, the 3D echo approach has proven to be the most unique, powerful, and convincing method for understanding the complicated anatomy of the valves and their dynamism. The method has been useful for surgical management, including robotic mitral valve repair. Moreover, this method has become indispensable for nonsurgical procedures such as edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. Color Doppler 3D echo has also been valuable to identify the location of the regurgitant orifice, and the severity and character of the valvular regurgitation. In addition, 3D echo is invaluable in the diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease and in certain other situations, such as evaluation of the aortic annulus for transcatheter aortic valve implantation or replacement. It is now clear that 3D echocardiography, especially with the continued development of real-time 3D transesophageal echo technology, will enhance the diagnosis and management of patients with heart diseases."
