        "Treatment and rehabilitation of patients with heart disease is focused on survival, work resumption, achievement of a state of subjective well-being and compliance with behavioural changes in order to prevent progression of the atherosclerotic process.",
        "To propose a specific job fitness evaluation method for workers with heart disease, based on analysis of occupational factors influencing the cardiovascular system and the definition of a clinical and functional profile of the patient, with special regard to aspects influencing vocational attitude.",
        "A literature review was performed.",
        "Although resumption of work is not the sole objective in the rehabilitation process, it remains an important goal not only for economic reasons, but also because it is beneficial for most patients' psychological well-being. However, it must be admitted that specific job fitness evaluation is rarely performed during rehabilitation programmes of cardiac patients and this can cause problems at the time of return to work. Doubts and uncertainties are also due to the lack of standardized evaluation methods and to the clinical peculiarity of these patients, mainly due to the risk of sudden disability. The job fitness evaluation method used in this study allows physicians to perform assessments based on objective data, so improving patients' confidence in their work capacity. To achieve a satisfactory application of the method, close cooperation between the cardiologist and the occupational physician is necessary."
