      "AbstractText": [
        "The aims of the present study were to assess the echocardiographic pattern of heart diseases, and to compare the pattern seen in a private echocardiography centre patronized by high income earners (group 1), with that in Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital patronized by low income earners (group 2), in Kano, Nigeria.",
        "the study was retrospective in design. The records of patients aged > or =15 years for a one year period (July 2006-June 2007) were reviewed.",
        "Hypertensive heart disease (in 56.7%) was the most common heart disease, more common among group 1 patients (p=0.027). Dilated cardiomyopathy was the 2nd most common heart disease (in 15.2%), more common among group 2 patients (p=0.037). Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) was the 3rd most common (in 8.7%) heart disease in the study, more common than rheumatic heart disease (in 8.3%). Peripartum cardiomyopathy was exclusively found among group 2 patients (4.3%).",
        "The pattern of heart diseases in Kano differs between low and higher income earners. HHD was the commonest heart disease among both low income and higher income earners. The relatively high frequency of IHD might be a demonstration of the advanced stage of epidemiologic transition in Kano Nigeria."
