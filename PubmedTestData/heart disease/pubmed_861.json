        "This article focuses on the complex interactions between the cardiovascular and neurologic systems. Initially, we focus on neurological complications in children with congenital heart disease both secondary to the underlying cardiac disease and complications of interventions. We later discuss diagnosis and management of common syncope syndromes with emphasis on vasovagal syncope. We also review the diagnosis, classification, and management of children and adolescents with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Lastly, we discuss long QT syndrome and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), reviewing advances in genetics and current knowledge of pathophysiology of these conditions. This article attempts to provide an overview of these disorders with focus on pathophysiology, advances in molecular genetics, and current medical interventions."
