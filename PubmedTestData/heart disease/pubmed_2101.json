        "Atrial fibrillation with organic heart disease shows a steady value for the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation (TC), whereas left ventricular contractility varies from beat to beat. However, there is no report on left ventricular relaxation in lone atrial fibrillation. This study assessed left ventricular relaxation in 5 patients with lone atrial fibrillation, 3 with ischemic heart disease and one with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular pressure was recorded at 3 msec intervals, with a high fidelity micromanometer-tipped catheter. Maximal positive dP/dt (dP/dtmax) and TC of isovolumetric left ventricular relaxation period [P(t) = (P0-P infinity) exp (-t/TC) + P infinity] were measured as indices of left ventricular contractility and left ventricular relaxation, respectively. Correlation coefficients of dP/dtmax and TC versus the ratio of the preceding to the pre-preceding RR-interval (RR2/RR1) were calculated. A good correlation was found between dP/dtmax and RR2/RR1 in all patients (r = 0.71-0.84, p < 0.0001). No correlation between TC and RR2/RR1 was found in patients with atrial fibrillation with organic heart disease, but a good correlation was found between TC and RR2/RR1 in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (r = 0.74-0.95, p < 0.0001). The correlation between TC and RR2/RR1 is well preserved in lone atrial fibrillation. The mechanism of the variation of TC with the RR2/RR1 interval in lone atrial fibrillation may be similar to the change of TC in postextrasystolic potentiation, which is attributed to the change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Absence of correlation between TC and RR2/RR1 interval may indicate that left ventricular relaxation is disturbed in patients with atrial fibrillation with organic heart disease."
