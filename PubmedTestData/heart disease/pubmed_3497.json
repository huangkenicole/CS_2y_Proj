        "The global results of various series of heart transplantation (HT) are essential to assess the life expectancy provided by this technique. Due to the increasing graft shortage, it appears essential to very strictly candidates for HT.",
        "From March 8, 1989 to December 7, 1994, 75 orthotopic Hts were performed in 62 men and 12 women (1 case of retransplantation). The mean age was 47.46 +/- 15.02 years (range: 2.5-66 years). Four patients were younger than 10 years and 22 were older than 60 years. Our series included more cases of ischaemic heart disease (36) than dilated cardiomyopathies (33), with a history of cardiac surgery in almost one quarter (20) of patients with ischaemic heart disease.",
        "The immediate postoperative survival rate was 94.7% with 3 deaths attributable to refractory pulmonary hypertension associated with graft failure and one death related to postoperative tamponade. Five other patients died during the following 3 months, increasing the mean global survival to 88%. After a mean follow-up of 2.1 years (maximum 5.8 years), the actuarial 5-year survival rate was 56.8%. Eleven patients died between 4 and 38 months (mean: 18.2 months). Two deaths were due to cancers, 4 were due to septicaemia, another 4 were due to rejection and finally 1 was due to meningeal haemorrhage. The frequency (19) of reoperations for clot removal was due to the large number of patients with a history of previous heart surgery (20).",
        "Strict recipient selection, possibly based on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, the use of pulsatile circulatory assistance systems, improved CMV, morphometry and donor-recipient age matching, should optimize the results of a technique, whose efficacy is confirmed in this series."
