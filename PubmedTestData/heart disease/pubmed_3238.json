        "Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems globally. A major hurdle to the development of more effective therapeutics is the reliance on animal models that fail to faithfully recapitulate human pathophysiology. The predictivity of in vitro models that lack the complexity of in vivo tissue remain poor as well. To combat these issues, researchers are developing organ-on-a-chip models of the heart that leverage the use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in combination with novel platforms engineered to better recapitulate tissue- and organ-level physiology. The integration of novel biosensors into these platforms is also a critical step in the development of these models, as they allow for increased throughput, real-time and longitudinal phenotypic assessment, and improved efficiency during preclinical disease modeling and drug screening studies. These platforms hold great promise for both improving our understanding of heart disease as well as for screening potential therapeutics based on clinically relevant endpoints with better predictivity of clinical outcomes. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art heart-on-a-chip platforms, the integration of novel biosensors into these models for real-time and continual monitoring of tissue-level physiology, as well as their use for modeling heart disease and drug screening applications. We also discuss future perspectives and further advances required to enable clinical trials-on-a-chip and next-generation precision medicine platforms."
