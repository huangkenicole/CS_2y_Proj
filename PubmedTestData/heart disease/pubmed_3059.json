        "The self-reported prevalence of risk factors for heart disease among Canadians with and without heart disease is estimated. The characteristics associated with these risk factors are examined in order to identify groups to be targeted for primary and secondary prevention.",
        "The data are from the household component of the 1994/95 National Population Health Survey (NPHS).",
        "For the population aged 20 and older with and without heart disease, bivariate and multiple regression analyses were used to determine associations between four risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and inactivity) and demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status.",
        "According to the NPHS, 4.4% of people aged 20 and older reported that they heart disease. However, many more adults had risk factors for this disease. As well, about one-quarter of those without heart disease and half of those with heart disease had two or more risk factors. To some extent, many of these risks are modifiable. The groups particularly at risk were people older than 35, those with less than high school graduation, those in households with inadequate income, people who consumed three or more drinks a day, and residents of the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Ontario."
