        "Decreases in circulating hsCRP have been associated with increased physical activity and exercise training, although the ability of exercise interventions to reduce hsCRP and which individuals benefit the most remains unclear. This meta-analysis evaluates the ability of exercise to reduce hsCRP levels in healthy individuals and in individuals with heart disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted that included exercise interventions trials from 1995 to 2012. Forty-three studies were included in the final analysis for a total of 3575 participants. Exercise interventions significantly reduced hsCRP (standardized mean difference -0.53 mg/L; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.33). Results of sub-analysis revealed no significant difference in reductions in hsCRP between healthy adults and those with heart disease (p = .20). Heterogeneity between studies could not be attributed to age, gender, intervention length, intervention type, or inclusion of diet modification. Exercise interventions reduced hsCRP levels in adults irrespective of the presence of heart disease.\u200b."
