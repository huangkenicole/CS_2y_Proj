        "Considerable experience by many independent workers with the use of anticoagulants in the treatment of certain types of heart disease has shown that such therapy reduces significantly the incidence of thromboembolic complications and, largely through this effect, the morbidity and mortality rate from heart disease of these types. This is certainly established in acute coronary occlusion with myocardial infarction and in those instances of rheumatic heart disease with auricular fibrillation in which repeated embolic phenomena have occurred. The case for the administration of the anticoagulants in congestive heart failure is less secure, although there is no doubt that the number of thromboembolic complications is reduced by use of them. The administration of the anticoagulants requires considerably more exacting attention than does the administration of the majority of therapeutic agents in use commonly today. Hence, it is suggested that the use of anticoagulants in heart disease be restricted to those instances in which the indications are clear and facilities are compatible with the efficient and safe use of the drug, whether Dicumarol or heparin."
