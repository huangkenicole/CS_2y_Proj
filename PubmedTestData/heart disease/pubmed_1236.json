        "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality among women in the western hemisphere. Until recently, cardiovascular disease was considered a disease mainly affecting men, and information regarding the unique characteristics of cardiovascular disease in women was lacking. Recent research has demonstrated the differences between the genders regarding risk factors, the presentation of coronary events and the response to various therapeutic modalities. Despite these differences, it is clear that women benefit from risk reduction strategies similar to those effectively implemented in men. More research is needed to further clarify the differences between the genders."
