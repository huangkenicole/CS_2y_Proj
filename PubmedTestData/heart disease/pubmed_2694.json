        "CAD is the most common cause of death in older men and was present in 44% of 664 men, mean age 80 years. Independent risk factors for new coronary events in older men include increasing age, prior CAD, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high serum total cholesterol, and low serum HDL cholesterol. In older men with hypertension, echocardiographic LVH is a powerful independent predictor of new coronary events, atherothrombotic brain infarction, and CHF. In 554 older men with a mean age of 80 years, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography demonstrated that the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 14%, 1 + aortic regurgitation or greater was 31%, rheumatic mitral stenosis was 0.4, 1 mitral regurgitation or greater was 32%, mitral annular calcium was 35%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was 3%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was 1%, left atrial enlargement was 29%, LVH was 41%, and abnormal LVEF was 29%. The prevalence and incidence of CHF increase with age in older persons. The prevalence of a normal LVEF associated with CHF as a result of prior myocardial infarction or hypertension was 22% in men aged 60 to 69 years, 33% in men aged 70 to 79 years, 41% in men aged 80 to 89 years, and 47% in men aged 90 years or older."
