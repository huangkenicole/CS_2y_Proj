        "Clinical cardiology encompasses all forms of heart disease and their more general characteristics, and its sphere of activity includes practical aspects of prevention, diagnosis, and inpatient and outpatient treatment as applied to patients on an everyday basis. Since certain areas of cardiology have become highly specialized, this review of new developments reported in the past year has attempted to bring together all those advances that are not the subject of research in some particular specialization within cardiology and that have such a wide range of application that they should be familiar to all clinical cardiologists, irrespective of their daily responsibilities. For the purposes of this review, articles were classified according to their origin as either English-language, European, or domestic publications. The review concludes with a summary of registry data collected in the last two years by the Clinical and Outpatient Cardiology Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology."
