        "Within a period of three months indications and diagnostic as well as therapeutic consequences of all echocardiographic studies were investigated in a middle-size hospital. 174 of a total of 188 examinations were usable. Most examinations were performed in order to detect or to verify left-ventricular failure or coronary heart disease. The diagnostic and therapeutic consequences were enormous; more than 90% of all pathological findings were listed as diagnoses in the final medical report. In terms of valvular heart disease, pericardial effusion and left-ventricular failure the echocardiographic study was most essential for diagnosis. In contrast most normal findings were seen with suspicion of coronary heart disease. Changes in medication or new prescription of oral anticoagulation, ACE inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists were significantly related to the therapeutic recommendations of the echocardiographic studies. The recommendations concerning antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis or further diagnostic investigation were respected with few exceptions. Obviously little conclusion could be drawn from a normal echocardiographic study; a well-established indication is essential for the benefit of echocardiography."
