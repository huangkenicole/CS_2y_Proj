        "Psychological features and complaints of persons presenting to medical settings with heart-focused anxiety and noncardiac chest pain are poorly understood. Comparing 20 healthy heart-anxious patients to cardiac and surgical inpatients and nonpatient controls, we found that healthy heart-anxious patients (a) were as afraid of chest pain and heart palpitations as inpatients with heart disease, (b) were as incapacitated by symptoms and using medical services as much as both inpatient groups; and (c) reported higher levels of cardiac disease conviction, heart awareness, and behaviors designed to protect their heart than surgical patients and nonpatients. Compared to all other groups, healthy heart-anxious patients reported more panic and other anxiety disorders, hypochondriacal beliefs, physical symptoms, obsessive-compulsive concerns, and negative affect. Following a hyperventilation test, heart-anxious patients also indicated more distressing symptoms and thoughts, and felt less safe and in control than surgical patients and nonpatients. Results support efforts for a timely recognition, diagnosis, and behavioral treatment of persons with heart-focused anxiety."
