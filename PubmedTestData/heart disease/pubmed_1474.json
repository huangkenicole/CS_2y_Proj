      "AbstractText": [
        "To study the epidemiology of cardiac disease in children and their outcome in Lebanon, we established a Children's Cardiac Registry Center (CCRC) at the American University of Beirut-Medical Center.",
        "The CCRC included prospectively all pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or acquired heart disease (AHD) who were evaluated at our center, between March 1, 1997 and July 31, 2000.",
        "Out of the 1000 patients with cardiac anomalies enrolled in the CCRC, 917 (91.7%) had CHD and the rest had AHD. Ventricular septal defect was the most common cardiac malformation with a relative frequency of 25.3%, followed by pulmonary stenosis (14.6%), aortic anomalies (8%), ASD (8%) and tetralogy of Fallot (7.8%). Complex cardiac lesions like HLHS, TGA and AVC had lower frequencies at 0.4%, 3.7% and 3.5% respectively. The most common AHD was rheumatic heart disease (42.2%). 34.9% of the registry patients with CHD and 10.8% with AHD underwent surgical intervention. There were 4.8% and 2.4% mortality rates in the CHD and AHD groups, respectively during the 40-month study period.",
        "The prevalence of many of the cardiac malformations in the CCRC was similar to that reported in the literature. However, some of the complex cardiac lesions were less common. The outcome of the two groups of patients is comparable to the outcome of children with cardiac malformation from developed countries. The establishment of a registry at the national level is important. Appropriate identification of the cardiac disease, its epidemiology, and outcome is of utmost importance in guiding adequate care."
