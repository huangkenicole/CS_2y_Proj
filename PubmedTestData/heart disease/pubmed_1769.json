        "For more than 10 years, balloon-expandable intravascular stents have become an integral part of treatment for obstructive vascular lesions in children and adults with congenital heart disease. The initial problems with stents, such as sharp edges, rigid frame and unacceptable shortening when over-expanded have been overcome to a large extent with the newer designs. The problems related to delivery of stents, such as stent migration, balloon rupture, flaring of the edges of the stent, rupture of vessels and milking of the stent off the balloon, have also been overcome by newer designs of balloons. The failure of growth of balloon-expandable stents with the growth of the child is managed by redilation with or without additional stenting and newer growth stents. Self-expanding stents are not appropriate for use in growing children due to the limitation of their maximum diameters. The development of biodegradable stents may overcome these disadvantages in the future. Various new developments have recently occurred. Covered stents are ideal for treating acute vessel rupture and in isolating vascular aneurysms. Drug-eluting stents may prevent restenosis, but have not been used in children. Valved stents are a recent innovation for the treatment of regurgitant pulmonary valves."
