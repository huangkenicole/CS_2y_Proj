        "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) carry a high cardiovascular risk. In this patient group, cardiac structure and function are frequently abnormal and 74% of patients with CKD stage 5 have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) at the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Cardiac changes, such as LVH and impaired left ventricular systolic function, have been associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Despite the prevalence of underlying cardiac abnormalities, symptoms may not manifest in many patients. Fortunately, a range of available and emerging cardiac imaging tools may assist with diagnosing and stratifying the risk and severity of heart disease in patients with CKD. Moreover, many of these techniques provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac abnormalities in patients with renal disease. Knowledge of the currently available cardiac imaging modalities might help nephrologists to choose the most appropriate investigative tool based on individual patient circumstances. This Review describes established and emerging cardiac imaging modalities in this context, and compares their use in CKD patients with their use in the general population."
