        "The sensitivity of 30 electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, isolated or combined, was examined to determine the relation to the underlying disease. Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), systemic hypertension, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathy were evaluated. A cardiac partition technique was used to define ventricular hypertrophy. Single electrocardiographic criteria often showed high sensitivity for 1 disease state, but not for others. Precordial voltage criteria were most sensitive for those with hypertensive and valvular disease. A QRS axis of more than -30 degrees occurred most often in patients with CAD. Both left atrial abnormality and abnormal T-wave inversion of more than 1 mm in V6 occurred with a high sensitivity in general; however, T-wave inversion of more than 1 mm in V6 had a low sensitivity in cardiomyopathy. Methods using combinations of various electrocardiographic criteria improved sensitivity. Using these methods, sensitivity of the electrocardiogram for LV hypertrophy was excellent for patients with systemic hypertension and valvular heart disease and acceptable by usual standards for patients with CAD and cardiomyopathy. Because the use of a single criterion is often ineffective, methods using multiple electrocardiographic criteria to detect LV hypertrophy are recommended when the patients under study have diverse cardiac diseases."
