        "Coronary heart disease and other vascular diseases account for approximately half of all deaths in women. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes (atherosclerosis and thrombosis) are similar, deaths and other clinical end-points are significantly delayed compared to men. The reason for this sex-related delay in the expression of vascular disease remains a matter of debate but may be largely attributable to the actions of endogenous oestrogens: coronary heart disease manifestations are extremely rare in premenopausal women but increase after the menopause. These observations have lead to speculation that oestrogen-replacement therapy might continue to retard the development of cardiovascular disease in the post-menopausal years (primary prevention). The cardioprotective benefits of oestrogens include a favourable impact on plasma lipids, anti-platelet effects, preservation of endothelium-mediated vasodilatation and antioxidant effects. Several observational studies support this thesis but the results of prospective randomised controlled trials are still awaited. Secondary preventative measures such as aspirin, beta-blockade, ACE inhibition and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors seem to be equally effective for women as men. However, there remains evidence that physicians are less likely to use such interventions in women at high risk."
