        "The invasive cardiac laboratory at the Singapore General Hospital was established in 1964. It was completely renovated and re-equipped in 1975 to cater for all the permutations and combinations that may be required for the safe conduct of cardiac catheterization procedures. A total of 4,849 procedures were done by 33 operators over 18 years. Patients for invasive procedures were usually discussed at the Monday Cardiac Conference prior to a decision being made to study. As such, the selected patients were usually the ill ones and the patients who required cardiac surgery. In the 1807 cardiac catheterizations done between 1975 and 1979, 1137 patients were found to be suffering from congenital heart disease, 586 were found to have acquired heart disease and 46 patients had coronary heart disease. The commonest congenital cardiac defect was atrial septal defect (or patent foramen ovale). Secondary pulmonary hypertension was found in 373 patients with acquired heart disease. Major complications occurred on 149 occasions and these were all in ill patients with severe heart disease."
