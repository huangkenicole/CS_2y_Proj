        "We studied eleven consecutive patients: eight with Dermatomyositis (DM) and three with Polymyositis (PM) from the cardiological point of view through non invasive methods. Nine patients (82%) had some kind of cardiopulmonary complications as shown by any of the used methods.",
        "eight (73%) referred some kind of cardiopulmonary symptoms, mainly dyspnea; Physical examination; in seven (64%) was abnormal, detecting increased second pulmonary sound in four (36%), findings of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in two (18%) and in two (18%) S3 gallop; Electrocardiogram: in seven (64%) was abnormal; six (55%) had some kind of heart enlargement corresponding four (36%) to right atrial or ventricular hypertrophy (RAH & RVH) and two (18%) to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), three (27%) had incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, one (9%) had bifascicular block and one (9%) left anterior hemiblock. Two (18%) had sinus tachycardia and two (18%) atrial premature contractions; d) chest ray: six (55%) were abnormal, among them, three (27%) had pulmonary fibrosis, three (27%) had RAH and/or RVH, two (18%) had LVH and one (9%) pericardial effusion; e) Echocardiogram: was abnormal in eight (73%), corresponding three (27%) to RVH, three to MVP which has been considered rare, in two (18%) congestive cardiomyopathy, in two (18%) pericardial effusion and in one (9%) type \"A\" paradoxical septal movement."
