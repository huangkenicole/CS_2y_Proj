      "AbstractText": [
        "A comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular responses to drugs in human heart disease is limited by species differences between humans and experimental animals. In addition, isolation of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) is complicated because cells obtained by biopsy do not proliferate to provide sufficient numbers of cells for preclinical studies in vitro. Interestingly, the discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) has opened up the possibility of generating and studying heart disease in a culture dish. The combination of reprogramming and genome editing technologies to generate a broad spectrum of human heart diseases in vitro offers a great opportunity to elucidate gene function and mechanisms. However, to exploit the potential applications of hiPSC-derived-CMs for drug testing and studying adult-onset cardiac disease, a full functional characterization of maturation and metabolic traits is required. In this review, we focus on methods to reprogram somatic cells into hiPSC and the solutions for overcome immaturity of the hiPSC-derived-CMs to mimic the structure and physiological properties of the adult human CMs to accurately model disease and test drug safety. Finally, we discuss how to improve the culture, differentiation, and purification of CMs to obtain sufficient numbers of desired types of hiPSC-derived-CMs for disease modeling and drug development platform."
