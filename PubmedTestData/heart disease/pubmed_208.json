        "Experience is presented of paediatric cardiology in a well-equipped and staffed centre during a six-year period in a developing country. Despite the success of the programme in offering first class medical investigation and surgical care to a large number of children, it is estimated that only about 2% of the existing cases in the country were operated upon. The main problems were the large numbers of cases, creating long waiting lists, and the lack of adequately trained paramedical personnel. Although paediatric cardiology in other developing countries is by no means a first priority, thousands of children suffering from heart disease should not be ignored. It appears that establishing similar centres for the care of children with heart disease in those countries is necessary; that they would contribute to patient care and medical education, would uncover the magnitude of the problem and would open ways to its future solution. The possibility of utilization of the facilities in the Western countries must also be considered."
