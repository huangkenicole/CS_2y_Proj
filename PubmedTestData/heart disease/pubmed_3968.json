        "Surprisingly few studies described the value of Doppler parameters in patients from the community.",
        "The aim was to determine the prevalence of prolonged IVRT (>0.105s) or a prolonged EDT (>0.280s) with a reduced E/A (<0.5) in heart patients from the community without valvular, systolic or rhythmic dysfunction. The associations of these parameters to all cause mortality and NYHA functional class were examined as well.",
        "Seventy-two volunteer stable patients with a history of heart disease were identified from general practice. Patients with LVEF below 0.45, valvular abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, and pacemaker were excluded. Routine blood tests, echocardiography, chest X-ray, physical examination and mortality were evaluated.",
        "male 33%, mean age of 68 years, hypertension 82%, ischaemic heart disease 43%, and NYHA class I+II+III in 50+39+11%. Abnormal EDT occurred in 4% (95% CI from 0 to 9%), IVRT in 18% (9-27%), E/A in 0%. None had a restrictive pattern. EDT was longer in NYHA III than in NYHA I-II patients (median 0.25 vs. 0.19s, p=0.0006). E/A and IVRT were not associated with NYHA class or mortality. After 7.4 years 16 of 72 patients died. EDT predicted mortality in univariate analysis but not in a multivariate analysis where NYHA class and gender were the only significant predictors.",
        "Prolonged EDT was weakly associated to NYHA class and mortality while IVRT and E/A were not. Prolonged IVRT was a frequent finding, but a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction is not supported by mild to moderate abnormal IVRT or E/A."
