        "Stents are vital devices to treat vascular stenosis in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Bioresorbable stents (BRSs) have been applied to reduce challenging complications caused by permanent metal stents. However, it remains almost a total lack of BRSs with satisfactory compression performance specifically for children with congenital heart disease, leading to importantly suboptimal effects. In this work, composite bioresorbable prototype stents with superior compression resistance were designed by braiding and annealing technology, incorporating poly (p-dioxanone) (PPDO) monofilaments and polycaprolactone (PCL) multifilament. Stent prototype compression properties were investigated. The results revealed that novel composite prototype stents showed superior compression force compared to the control ones, as well as recovery ability. Furthermore, deformation mechanisms were analyzed by computational simulation, which revealed bonded interlacing points among yarns play an important role. This research presents important clinical implications in bioresorbable stent manufacture and provides further study with an innovative stent design."
