        "344 cases of Heart-Qi Deficiency Syndrome (HQDS) including 19 Kinds of disease were observed to explore the rule of differentiation of symptoms and signs for HQDS. The results showed that the common symptoms of HQDS were weakness, shortness of breath, and palpitation, etc. According to with or without complicated cardiovascular diseases, the patients were divided into two groups: group A with cardiovascular diseases, group B without that. In group A, the symptoms and signs of HQDS were the most frequent and early clinical manifestations, the associated symptoms and signs were blood stasis and attack of water-evil, etc. In group B, in whom often associated with nervous and emotional symptoms such as insomnia, dreamfulness, and amnesia, etc., which was due to the disturbance of emotional activities of heart. In order to avoid diagnostic confusion, the authors suggest that the HQDS patients with cardiovascular diseases would be diagnosed as HQDS; on the other hand, the HQDS patients without cardiovascular diseases would be diagnosed as disturbance of emotional activities of heart."
