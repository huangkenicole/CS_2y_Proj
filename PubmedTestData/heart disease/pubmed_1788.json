        "Cardiac transplantation is a treatment option for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) who developed refractory heart failure and/or intractable arrhythmia. However, the pretransplant characteristics and post-transplant prognosis for patients with nondilated idiopathic HC has not yet fully elucidated. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed 813 consecutive transplant recipients undergoing cardiac transplantation at Columbia University Medical Center from 1999 to 2010 and compared the clinical course of 41 patients with idiopathic HC with that of 373 patients with ischemic heart disease and 398 patients with other heart disease. The patients with HC were younger than those with ischemic heart disease (47.8 \u00b1 14.0 vs 57.1 \u00b1 9.4 years; p <0.0001). The proportion of patients undergoing ventricular assist devise surgery for bridge-to-transplant was lower in patients with HC than in those with ischemic heart disease or other heart disease (14.6% vs 31.1% vs 35.7%, all p <0.01). The post-transplant survival of those with HC was better than that for those with ischemic heart disease (90.1% vs 85.8% and 83.9% vs 67.1% at 1 and 5 years, respectively; p = 0.0359), although it was not significantly different from those with other heart disease. Proportional hazards analysis revealed that the subjects with HC had reduced post-transplant mortality (hazard ratio 0.4760, 95% confidential interval 0.1889 to 0.9762; p = 0.042) on univariate, but not multivariate, analysis. Most patients with HC had nondilated left ventricles (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension \u2264 55 mm; n = 27), and post-transplant survival did not differ from that for those with dilated left ventricles (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension >55 mm; n = 14). In conclusion, the post-transplant survival of those with HC did not differ from those of the subjects who underwent transplant for other non-HC indications."
