      "AbstractText": [
        "Imaging artifacts are frequently encountered when performing clinical echocardiography. Based on our review of the literature, two-dimensional linear artifacts are mainly reported in the ascending aorta in patients with suspected aortic dissections. However, pulmonary artery artifacts that mimic pulmonary artery dissection have not been discussed. We herein report our experience with children and adults with preexisting heart conditions and pulmonary artery imaging artifacts.",
        "The study population comprised 10 patients with heart disease who were treated at our hospital from March 2015 to September 2017. Nine patients were children with congenital heart disease, mainly patent ductus arteriosus (n = 8), and one patient was an adult with pulmonary artery hypertension. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients.",
        "We confirmed the diagnosis in six patients during a surgical operation for other indications and in four patients by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. The most common pulmonary imaging artifact was observed from the left high parasternal view (9/10, 90%). Most of the artifacts were diagonally oriented (8/10, 80%), and a few were horizontally oriented. Half of the artifacts were located in the main pulmonary arteries with mild pulmonary artery dilatation. Pulmonary hypertension was seen only in the adult patient. The thymus gland was clearly seen in young patients.",
        "Pulmonary artery imaging artifacts in patients with preexisting heart disease during echocardiographic examination can mimic pulmonary artery dissection. Understanding the types and origins of these ultrasound artifacts is important to avoid a false-positive diagnosis."
