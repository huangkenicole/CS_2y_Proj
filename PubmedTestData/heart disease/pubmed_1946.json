        "Many general signs familiar to physicians can be found on the skin in cardiac patients. These include (a) cyanosis, central and peripheral, (b) erythremia, flushing and erythema, (c) digital clubbing and (d) alteration in texture. Specific cardiac conditions often have useful diagnostic cutaneous clues. Of these the association of coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia and xanthomas is the most important. Rare syndromes such as the \"leopard syndrome\" often have distinctive skin signs. Multisystemic disorders may affect the heart and skin simultaneously or in sequence. They include collagen vascular diseases, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis and relapsing polychondritis. Finally iatrogenic disease arising from treatment of cardiac or cutaneous disease may induce changes in one or the other organ. The heart and the skin have much in common. These manifestations help elucidate the cause, evaluate the diagnosis, and follow the treatment and progress of these diseases."
