        "Seven per cent of a sample group of civil service employees were found to have diagnosable heart disease. The diagnosis was made on the basis of a complete physical examination and history taken by a specialist in internal medicine and/or heart disease. In addition a questionnaire form related to symptoms of heart disease was filled out by the patient, and various laboratory tests were made. As a technique in cardiac case-finding, the electrocardiogram was the best single device. Of all the cases of heart disease in this survey 65 per cent were detected from tracings obtained by using all 12 leads, and 57 per cent if only the three standard limb leads were taken; but of the presumably normal persons, 13 per cent would be erroneously suspected of possible heart disease by this technique. Heart disease was detected in 50 per cent of the diagnosed cases on the basis of answers to three of the questions in the questionnaire. Eighteen per cent of normal persons would also have been suspected of having heart disease by this case-finding device. Although the survey reported did not develop a simple cardiac case-finding technique, the data presented indicated that a questionnaire history-form, if judiciously used and evaluated, may be of value to physicians who examine large numbers of patients who are unwilling to submit to a complete cardiac evaluation."
