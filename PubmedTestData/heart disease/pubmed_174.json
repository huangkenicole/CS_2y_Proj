        "Despite 20th century scientific and technologic advances in the area of cardiovascular medicine and public health and associated benefits in terms of significant declines in mortality, heart disease remains as the dominant cause of death for all Americans. Tremendous geographic variation in age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality, varying over two-fold between the highest and lowest states, provides troubling evidence that this epidemic is raging unrelentingly in many communities across our country. Also disturbing are signs that the significant decline in coronary heart disease mortality observed since the 1960s may have slowed in recent years. The coronary heart disease epidemic continues to hit hard among certain racial and ethnic minorities, prompting the Healthy People 2010 national call for action to eliminate cardiovascular disease disparity."
