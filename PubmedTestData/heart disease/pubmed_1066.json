        "Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) prevalence is increasing worldwide, with advanced heart failure (HF) as a leading cause of death. Limited data are available on durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in ACHD patients.",
        "ACHD patients from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database were identified and propensity matched with non-ACHD patients using risk factors from the INTERMACS Seventh Annual Report. We compared these groups for the primary outcome of post-MCS mortality. We also investigated adverse event rates, functional status, and health-related quality of life.",
        "ACHD (n = 128) and non-ACHD (n = 512) patients were appropriately matched by baseline characteristics. ACHD patients had a longer length of stay at MCS implant (24 vs 19 days, p = 0.006) but similar rates of post-MCS adverse events and hospitalization. There were similar improvements in functional status and health related quality of life post-MCS in both groups. ACHD patients had significantly higher mortality post-MCS exclusively during the first 5 months after implant (p = 0.003) and a lower probability of receiving a transplant (p = 0.003). Risk factors for early mortality were biventricular or total artificial heart device implant and age > 50 years.",
        "ACHD patients experience a higher early mortality after MCS but have similar adverse event rates and similar improvements in functional capacity and quality of life compared with non-ACHD patients. These data support expansion of MCS use in selected ACHD patients."
