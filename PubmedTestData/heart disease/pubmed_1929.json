        "A 61-year-old previously healthy woman had been suffering from a dry cough for several weeks. On auscultation she had a 3/6 holosystolic murmur. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB) and abnormal repolarisation. Conventional and oesophageal echocardiography revealed a right ventricular tumour and significant coronary heart disease. At operation a tumour, arising from the interventricular septum and histologically consisting of thyroid tissue, was resected. In addition, the left mammary artery was anastomosed to the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery. A 34-year-old woman developed increasing exertion-independent dyspnoea. For years she had had occasional attacks of palpitations and restlessness, once even a syncope. The ECG showed IRBBB, echocardiography demonstrated a tumour attached to the right side of the interventricular septum. The tumour was removed and found histologically to consist of colloid-containing thyroid follicles. Both tumours were benign. 45 and 36 months, respectively, later both patients are free of symptoms."
