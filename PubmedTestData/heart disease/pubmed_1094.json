        "To evaluate the mechanism of sudden death in childhood and the physical activity levels at the onset of sudden death, we studied the following items: (1) the incidence and the circumstances surrounding sudden death at school in Kanagawa Prefecture, (2) high risk heart diseases detected among healthy school children by heart disease screening, (3) sudden cardiac death or near miss seen in outpatients with heart disease except congenital heart disease. Among total 15,156,346 school children, sudden death was observed in 97 subjects (M:77, F:20). Annual incidence of sudden death was 6.4 per 10(6). Of the 97 subjects, acute heart failure of unknown etiology was found in 60 (62%), cardiovascular disease in 18 (19%), cerebral vascular accidents in 14 (14%) and heat stroke in 5 (5%). Of the 78 subjects (M:64, F:14) considered as sudden cardiac death, 62 (79%) died during sports activities, and 16 (21%) died at rest. Of the 62 subjects, 29 died during track and field activities and 7 while swimming, both in physical education classes. Eighteen died during athletic club activities and 8 during extracurricular activities. Consequently, 54 subjects (87%) died in the presence of a school teacher. Of the 18 subjects with cardiovascular disease, 9 (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 3, myocarditis in 3, Kawasaki disease in 2 and long QT in one) were diagnosed initially by the autopsy study. Latent high risk heart diseases, detected among presumably healthy school children by the heart disease screening program, were the following: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Kawasaki disease and some arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, sick sinus syndrome, A-V block and atrial fibrillation). Follow-up observations of outpatients with heart disease revealed the same results as the heart disease screening program. In order to prevent sudden death at school, the following recommendations should be observed: 1) sports directors should learn \"sports medicine in childhood\", including primary cardiovascular resuscitation, 2) an accurate heart disease screening program should be operated to detect latent high risk heart diseases, advise on adequate medical treatment, and help ensure an appropriate selection of sports activities, 3) comprehensive autopsy studies should be performed."
