        "Anxiety is associated with many forms and facets of heart disease, and, by extension, neurologic manifestations of heart disease. Despite its seeming self-evidence, anxiety is challenging to consistently define, measure, and operationalize in the context of medical research. Various diagnostic nosologies have been defined and refined over time, but anxiety is also a universal human experience that may be \"normal\" in many circumstances, particularly in the face of major medical issues. For these and other reasons, the research on anxiety and heart disease is mixed, incomplete, and often characterized by challenging questions of causality. Nonetheless, a broad body of literature has established clear connections between anxiety and vascular risk factors, cardiac disease, and cardiac surgery. These relationships are often intuitive, with research suggesting, for example, that chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with increased risk of heart disease. However, they are sometimes complexly reciprocal or even surprising (e.g., with high-anxiety individuals found to have better outcomes in some cardiac conditions by virtue of seeking evaluation and treatment earlier). This chapter reviews the construct of anxiety and its complexities, its associations with heart disease, and the established treatments for anxiety, concluding with questions about anxiety, heart disease, and their optimal management that still need to be answered."
