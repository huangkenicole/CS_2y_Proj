        "The purpose of this paper is to report results from a qualitative field study of 15 women with heart disease. The study was conducted over a two-year period in a number of clinical settings to document women's subjective experiences after angioplasty or cardiac surgery. The phenomena of interest were participants' perceptions of their health, the impact cardiac illness was having on their lives, lifestyle changes they had engaged in since diagnosis, and how they felt about having heart disease. Qualitative content analysis was applied to field notes and in-depth interviews. The overall sense of living with heart disease for these midlife women was one of paradox. Implications of their contradictory experiences are discussed as they apply to nursing practice."
