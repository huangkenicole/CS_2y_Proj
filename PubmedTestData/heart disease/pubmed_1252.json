        "The association of spontaneous echo contrast and thrombus in the left atrium in patients with mitral valve disease is controversial. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is an independent association between spontaneous echo contrast on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and intraoperative evidence of left atrial thrombus and to evaluate the clinical implications of spontaneous echo contrast in patients with symptomatic rheumatic mitral valve disease. A total of 255 patients who underwent surgery for rheumatic mitral valve diseases were preoperatively evaluated by transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium was carefully sought. The left atrium was carefully searched for evidence of thrombus intraoperatively. The association of spontaneous echo contrast and left atrial thrombus was determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Of the patients studied, 77 (30%) had left atrial thrombus. Left atrial thrombus was found in 47 and 21% of patients with and without spontaneous echo contrast, respectively (p < 0.001). Spontaneous echo contrast and atrial fibrillation were found to be the only two independent predictors of left atrial thrombus (odds ratio = 2.16; 95% confidence interval 1.15-4.04 p < 0.05, and odds ratio = 6.98; 95% confidence interval 3.45-14.16, p < 0.001, respectively). It was concluded that there is an independent association between spontaneous echo contrast on TTE and left atrial thrombus in patients with mitral valve disease requiring surgical correction. These patients are at high risk for left atrial thrombus and should, therefore, be considered for long-term anticoagulation."
