        "Heart disease, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathies, is the leading causes of death worldwide. The Hippo pathway is a central controller for organ size and tissue growth, which plays a pivotal role in determining cardiomyocytes and nonmyocytes proliferation, regeneration, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the effects of the Hippo pathway on heart disease and propose potential intervention targets. Especially, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of the Hippo pathway involved in maintaining cardiac homeostasis by regulating cardiomyocytes and nonmyocytes function in the heart. Based on this, we conclude that the Hippo pathway is a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular therapy, which will bring new perspectives for their treatments."
