        "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine sociodemographic and disease related factors affecting the quality of life and life style behavior in patients with heart disease.",
        "Data are collected via information form, Healthy Life Style Behaviors Scale, and short form-36 life quality scale to 325 people with heart disease. T test for independent samples, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation analyzes are used in statistical evaluation of the data.",
        "It has been determined that average age was 56.98\u00b111.89 years, 58.2% were male, 48.6% were graduated from primary school, 30.2% were haven't got any additional diseases of the patients in this study. Point average of healthy life style behaviors of people with heart disease obtained as 127.45\u00b120.51 and physical main dimension mean score was 51.95\u00b122.21, mental main dimension mean score was 52.71\u00b119.48. It has been understood that, in general, that male patients in 49-60 age group and married, having bachelor and master degrees, in good socio-economic status, working, without any additional disease and took training related to their disease, received high point from healthy life style behavior scale, but patients with cardiac failure had lower points (p<0.05). There was a positive relation between life qualities and healthy life style behaviors of the patients (p<0.01).",
        "Increasing of life quality of the patients especially with cardiac failure will be ensured by executing studies on development of healthy life style behaviors for people with heart disease and arranging training programs to them related to their disease."
