        "Control of hypertension and treatment of concomitant pathophysiologic conditions require use of multiple drugs. Unfortunately, most studies regarding hypertensive disease have focused on monotherapy. Thus, our knowledge of combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension is, to a great extent, extrapolation from monotherapy. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in combination with calcium antagonists should be particularly efficacious in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Drug classes that either stimulate the renin-angiotensin system or the sympathetic nervous system are less likely to reduce LVH and should be avoided. In hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure, amlodipine should be added to triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor, whereas in the postmyocardial ischemia patient, verapamil may exert some additional beneficial effects with regard to reinfarction rates. Given that two drugs when used separately are beneficial in a disorder does not necessarily mean that their combination is equally or even more beneficial. Thus, combination therapy should primarily be used for lowering arterial pressure and only secondarily to possibly improve concomitant pathophysiologic conditions associated with hypertensive heart disease."
