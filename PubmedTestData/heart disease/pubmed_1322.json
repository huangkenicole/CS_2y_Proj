        "Cardiac transplantation is a viable therapy for end-stage heart disease in both adults and children. Overall posttransplant survival in the pediatric age group (birth up to 18 years of age) is excellent (greater than 65% at 5 years for all age groups), comparable with the overall survival in the adult transplant recipients. Important differences exist regarding indications, evaluation, surgical technique, and posttransplant management. Indications for transplant in pediatric patients include metabolic and genetic forms of cardiomyopathy and structural congenital heart disease. Evaluation should include a metabolic workup, because potential etiologic factors include mitochondrial disorders, and genetic studies if indicated by phenotypic appearance or family pedigree. Children referred for transplantation with congenital heart disease have often had multiple attempts at palliative surgery, which increase peritransplant surgical risks. Key pediatric issues after transplantation include psychosocial support for the patient and family with regard to school, growth, development, and future expectations."
