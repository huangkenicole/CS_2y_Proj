        "This was a descriptive cross sectional study of one year duration conducted in Pediatric department of Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad. The objective was to assess the clinical pattern, age distribution and type of heart diseases in children under 5 years of age. In this study 150 children with suspicion of cardiac problem were enrolled.",
        "Among 150 cardiac patients 55.3% were male and 44.7% were female. Congenital heart diseases (CHD) seen in 89.3% and 10.7% had acquired heart disease. Among CHD 74.6% were Acyanotic lesions while cyanotic lesions were seen in 23.9% and 1.5% were cases of dextrocardia. Ventricular septal defect was the commonest Acyanotic lesion (29.9%) followed by atrial septal defect (25.4%). Among cyanotic heart diseases tetralogy of Fallot was the commonest lesion seen in 11.2% followed by transposition of great arteries and complex heart defect 5.2% and 3% respectively. Among acquired heart disease myocarditis was the commonest disease accounts 94% and pericardial effusion was seen in 6%.",
        "Regarding the type of congenital heart defect acyanotic defect was more common than cyanotic with ventricular septal defect commonest lesion. Tetralogy of Fallot's was commonest in cyanotic group. Availability of expertise locally will lead to more patients getting surgical treatment at an earlier age thereby reducing morbidity and mortality and improving quality of life for these children."
