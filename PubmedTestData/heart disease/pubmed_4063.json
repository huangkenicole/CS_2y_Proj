        "Spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) is common in the areas of slow blood flow. This study was conducted to examine the correlation of SEC and left atrial appendage function, atrial fibrillation (Af) and thrombus in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. The transthoracic and multiplane transesophageal echocardiograms were performed on 117 patients(mean age 42.22 +/- 10.79 years). Left atrial size, left atrial appendage area, mitral valve area, left atrial appendage flow peak emphatic velocity and full velocity were measured. The presence of SEC and thrombus in the left atrium and appendage was noted. The results showed that among the patients, 57 had normal sinus rhythm, 60 had Af; 19 had thrombus, 98 had no thrombus; 71 had SEC and 46 had no SEC. Compared with the patients without SEC, the patients with SEC showed greater incidence of thrombus (28.76% vs 0, P < 0.05), higher rate of Af (69.01% vs 23.91%, P < 0.05), larger LAD (46.93 +/- 0.85 mm vs. 41.76 +/- 1.05 mm, P < 0.05), larger LAA area (8.06 +/- 0.32 cm2 vs 6.92 +/- 0.31 cm2, P < 0.05), smaller MVA area (1.07 +/- 0.23 cm2 vs 1.32 +/- 0.35 cm2, P < 0.05), lower LAA flow peak emphatic velocity (0.17 +/- 0.01 m/s vs 0.32 +/- 0.02 m/s, P < 0.05), and lower LAA full velocity (0.18 +/- 0.01 m/s vs 0.31 +/- 0.03 m/s, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that the presence of SEC is associated with significantly greater incidence of thrombus, higher rate of Af, larger LAD and LAA area, smaller MVA area, lower LAA flow peak emphatic velocity and full velocity. Atrial fibrillation, the diameter of left atrium and the area of mitral valve are independent predictors of SEC. SEC is significantly associated with LAA function and thrombus formation."
