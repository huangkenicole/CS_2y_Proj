        "Heart disease is a leading cause of maternal death. The aim of this study is to review the most common causes of cardiac disease, highlight factors that should be recognized by the clinician, and address recent advances in the anaesthetic management of these patients. Incipient cardiac disease, including peripartum cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction and aortic dissection, accounts for approximately one in six maternal deaths. The keys to successful diagnosis and management of incipient disease are: a high index of suspicion, particularly in women with known risk factors for cardiovascular disease; a low threshold for radiological investigations; early cardiology input; and invasive monitoring during labour and delivery. Echocardiography is a safe, non-invasive test, under-used in pregnancy. Management of pregnant women with pre-existing cardiac problems should be undertaken by multidisciplinary teams in tertiary centres. In women with pre-existing cardiac disease wishing to proceed to term, cardiac status must be optimized preoperatively and planned elective delivery is preferable. Vaginal delivery is preferable, and with careful incremental regional anaesthesia is safe in most women with cardiac disease. The presence of adequate systems for early detection, appropriate referral to specialist centres, and timely delivery with multidisciplinary support can minimize the serious consequences of poorly controlled heart disease in pregnancy."
