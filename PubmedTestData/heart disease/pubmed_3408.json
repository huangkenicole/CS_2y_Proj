        "Echocardiography has become an extension of the physical examination in cardiovascular practice. Frequently, it is used to confirm a clinical diagnostic suspicion. Another important role is to detect the underlying cardiovascular lesion to explain a patient's symptom complex or an abnormality found on chest radiography, electrocardiography, or cardiac enzyme tests. Patients are referred to the echocardiography laboratory because of their symptoms or due to non-specific laboratory abnormalities, and echocardiographers are expected to provide a definite diagnosis or a therapeutic clue. The introduction of the matrix array transducer into clinical practice allowed the acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) datasets. 3D echocardiography (3DE) has many advantages over 2-dimensional echocardiography, such as: (1) improved visualization of the complex shapes and spatial relations between cardiac structures; (2) improved quantification of the cardiac volumes and function; and (3) improved display and assessment of valve dysfunction. 3DE is increasingly utilized during routine clinical practice. This review article is aimed to examine the current clinical utility and future directions of 3DE."
