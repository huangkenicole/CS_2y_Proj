        "Cardiomegaly on chest radiographs (CXR) in pediatric patients leads to multiple tests. We aimed to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of cardiomegaly on CXR in predicting subsequent heart disease and to assess the utility of obtaining a B-type Natriuretic Peptide level (BNP) and/or electrocardiogram (EKG) in such patients. We hypothesized that an echocardiogram may not be appropriate in all cases of cardiomegaly on CXR, particularly in a patient with a normal EKG and BNP level.",
        "We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with cardiomegaly on their initial CXR between January 2015-December 2017. Patients without a subsequent echocardiogram or known congenital heart disease were excluded. A patient was deemed to have heart disease if they had structural abnormalities, functional abnormalities or a pericardial effusion on echocardiogram. The PPV of CXR and the PPV/NPV of the other tests (EKG, BNP) were calculated using contingency tables.",
        "Four hundred and eighty nine patients met inclusion criteria. The PPV of cardiomegaly on CXR alone without any other diagnostic testing in predicting subsequent heart disease was 15%. The PPV increased if there was either an abnormal EKG or a BNP >100\u202fpg/ml and further increased if both of these were present. The PPV values were higher in patients <1\u202fyear of age.",
        "Cardiomegaly on CXR can often predict the presence of heart disease, particularly in infants. Further testing with EKG and BNP can better predict who may have heart disease, but it may not eliminate the need for echocardiography."
