      "AbstractText": [
        "A 66-year-old man with complex congenital heart defects (atrial septal defects, with incomplete cor triatriatum, an aneurysmal sac in the membranous septum, ventricular communication and pulmonary valve stenosis) was scheduled for surgery for progressive dyspnea even at rest. During anesthetic induction, effort was made to avoid increased shunting. Surgery consisted of resection of the cor triatriatum membrane, closure of communications with pericardial patches, pulmonary valve replacement, replacement of the root with a porcine root, and pulmonary artery aneurysmorrhaphy. Severely decreased contractility developed while the patient was still in the operating room; inotropic support with adrenaline and dobutamine was required. Extubation was completed in the postoperative recovery unit with no further complications. Echocardiography showed a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. We found few published reports of cases of complex congenital heart disease treated surgically in adulthood. In such cases, cardiac pathophysiology must be carefully considered, and maneuvers that increase systemic resistance or right-ventricular ejection fraction should be avoided. Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance should be kept as low as possible."
