        "Furazolidone (FZ) at 700 ppm was added to feed mixtures fed turkey poults two weeks posthatching to induce acute experimental cardiomyopathy. Poults in the control pen received the same ration but without FZ. Four of the control poults developed spontaneous round heart disease. From EKG data and blood samples obtained at weekly intervals, poults were selected for sacrifice at 5 weeks of age. Tissue samples from the left myocardial wall, liver, and pectoralis major and tibialis anterior muscles were analyzed for glycogen by biochemical assay. Blood glucose was determined with the Technicon autoanalyzer. Deposition of glycogen increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the myocardium of all affected poults and in the liver of all FZ-treated poults. Glycogen levels of the pectoralis major and tibialis anterior muscles were not affected by FZ, but a significant increase (p less than 0.05) was apparent in the pectoralis major muscle of spontaneous round heart poults. It was concluded that FZ influences glycogen metabolism, probably by enzyme inhibition, and that it tends to magnify effects seen in the spontaneous round heart syndrome. Glycogen infiltration of tissues such as the heart and white skeletal muscle suggests that the round heart syndrome may be a manifestation of the glycogen storage disease, idiopathic generalized glycogenosis. Lack of significant differences in the blood serum glucose levels of all poults indicates that these levels are not a reliable clinical parameter for monitoring development of the round heart syndrome."
