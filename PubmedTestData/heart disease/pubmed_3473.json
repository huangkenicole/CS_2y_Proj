        "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the relationship between maternal disease in early pregnancy of women of childbearing age and congenital heart disease of neonates. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional design was used in this study and stratified multistage random sampling method was used. A questionnaire survey was conducted in the childbearing-aged women during 2010-2013 in Shaanxi province. Propensity score (PS) matched (1\u22361) analysis was used to match participants with diseases to those without disease in early pregnancy. Through the control of the confounders step by step, a logistic regression model was established to evaluate the <i>ORs</i> of congenital heart disease according to the independent variable of maternal disease. <b>Results:</b> A total of 28 680 pairs of mothers and infants were included in this study, the proportion of the women with disease in early pregnancy was 20.25<i>%</i> (5 807). After PS matching, 5 436 pairs were matched. After adjusting all confounding factors, the multivariable logistic regression analysis results showed that maternal disease (<i>OR</i>=1.86, 95<i>%CI</i>: 1.23-2.81), especially cold (<i>OR</i>=2.19, 95<i>%CI</i>: 1.46-3.28), gynecological disease (<i>OR</i>=4.74, 95<i>%CI</i>: 2.03-11.09) and diabetes (<i>OR</i>=14.00, 95<i>%CI</i>: 1.64-119.21), in early pregnancy were the risk factors for congenital heart disease of neonate. <b>Conclusion:</b> In women of childbearing age, disease in early pregnancy, especially cold, gynecological disease and diabetes, can increase the risk of congenital heart disease in neonates."
