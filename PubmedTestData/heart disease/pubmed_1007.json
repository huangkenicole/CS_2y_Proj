        "Being one of the major therapeutic measures for malignant tumors, radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, plays a particularly crucial role in the multidisciplinary integrated treatment of thoracic tumors. With the development in radiotherapy technology, the research focus has shifted from improving the overall survival of malignant tumor patients to reducing the incidence of radiation-related injuries. Currently, radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) has become one of the leading non-cancer causes of death in thoracic tumor patients who have undergone radiotherapy, seriously affecting their quality of life and clinical prognosis. In recent years, there has been growing understanding of the pathogenesis of RIHD, and proposals have been made for some potential measures for the prevention and treatment of RIHD. Based on the clinical manifestations and pathological changes of RIHD that have been reported, we herein reviewed the biological mechanism and potential treatment options for RIHD. We also discussed existing challenges in the prevention and treatment of RIHD, intending to provide references for the prevention and treatment of RIHD."
