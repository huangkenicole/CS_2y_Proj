        "Over the past 2 decades, the discipline of palliative care has evolved and expanded such that it is now the standard of care for a variety of acute and chronic processes. Although there are recommendations encouraging incorporation of palliative care into the routine management of patients with chronic cardiac processes, such as congestive heart failure, implementation has been challenging, and nowhere more so than in the cardiac surgical population. However, as the boundaries of surgical care have expanded to include progressively more complex cases, increasing attention has been given to the integration of palliative care into their management. In this review article, the authors describe the existing evidence for palliative care team involvement in patients with non-operative and surgical cardiac diseases and examine future directions for growth in this field."
