        "Heart disease is encountered in nearly 1% of pregnancies, and the incidence is increasing. This is likely due to advances in cardiac management over the past 25 years, particularly advances in cardiac surgery and drugs, which have allowed more women with congenital and other abnormalities not only to survive to reach the age of child-bearing but also to carry a pregnancy to term successfully. Cardiac diseases of particular importance include stenotic valvular lesions, cyanotic disorders, and lesions accompanied by pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities are associated with increased fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, and therefore require very close monitoring during pregnancy. The physician also should be familiar with the more common cardiac disorders seen in pregnancy, be familiar with cardiovascular drugs and their potential effects on the pregnant patient and fetus, and be aware of cardiac disorders which are relative and absolute contraindications to pregnancy due to high rates of maternal mortality."
