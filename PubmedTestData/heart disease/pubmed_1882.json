        "The aim of the study was to compare the plasma levels of antioxidants by measuring total antioxidant activity (TAS) and ferric reducing ability of the plasma (FRAP) in healthy dogs and in those that are suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or from mitral endocardiosis (ME). Dogs with echocardiographically diagnosed ME (10 dogs) as well as DCM (23 dogs) were sampled. Of dogs with DCM, eight having DCM with sinus rhythm (SR) were included in the DCM-SR group and 15 having DCM with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the DCM-AF group. Total antioxidant levels measured by TAS assay differed neither significantly between the cardiac patients and the control group nor between the heart disease groups. Ferric reducing ability of the plasma in animals with cardiac disease was significantly higher than in the control animals, and the difference was also significant in between the two DCM groups. However, the differences between the antioxidant levels of the DCM and ME groups did not reach significance in none of the antioxidant (TAS and FRAP) tests. Summarizing the results of this study it can be concluded that there is an increased antioxidant reactivity detected by the FRAP, but not by the TAS assay in the blood of dogs with naturally occurring cardiac disorders. The magnitude of this increase seems to be more affected rather by the severity of the cardiac insufficiency and/or by the heart rate or rhythm disorder than by the underlying heart disease itself."
