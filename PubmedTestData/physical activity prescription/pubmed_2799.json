        "Monitoring variations in the functioning of the autonomic nervous system may help personalize training of runners and provide more pronounced physiological adaptations and performance improvements. We systematically reviewed the scientific literature comparing physiological adaptations and/or improvements in performance following training based on responses of the autonomic nervous system (ie, changes in heart rate variability) and predefined training. PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched systematically in July 2019. Keywords related to endurance, running, autonomic nervous system, and training. Studies were included if they (a) involved interventions consisting predominantly of running training; (b) lasted at least 3\u00a0weeks; (c) reported pre- and post-intervention assessment of running performance and/or physiological parameters; (d) included an experimental group performing training adjusted continuously on the basis of alterations in HRV and a control group; and (e) involved healthy runners. Five studies involving six interventions and 166 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Four HRV-based interventions reduced the amount of moderate- and/or high-intensity training significantly. In five interventions, improvements in performance parameters (3000\u00a0m, 5000\u00a0m, Loadmax, Tlim) were more pronounced following HRV-based training. Peak oxygen uptake ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msub> <mrow><mover><mi>V</mi> <mo>\u02d9</mo></mover> <mi>O</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn> <mtext>peak</mtext></mrow> </msub> </math> ) and submaximal running parameters (eg, LT1, LT2) improved following both HRV-based and predefined training, with no clear difference in the extent of improvement in <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <msub> <mrow><mover><mi>V</mi> <mo>\u02d9</mo></mover> <mi>O</mi></mrow> <mrow><mn>2</mn> <mtext>peak</mtext></mrow> </msub> </math> . Submaximal running parameters tended to improve more following HRV-based training. Research findings to date have been limited and inconsistent. Both HRV-based and predefined training improve running performance and certain submaximal physiological adaptations, with effects of the former training tending to be greater."
