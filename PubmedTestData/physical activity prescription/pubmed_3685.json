        "To investigate the acceptability and feasibility of using short message services (SMS) via cell phones to ensure adherence to management prescriptions by diabetic patients.",
        "Type 2 diabetic patients with 5 or more years of diabetes and having HbA1c between 7.0% to 10% were randomized to the control arm (n = 105) to receive standard care and to the intervention arm (SMS, n = 110). Messages in English on principles of diabetes management were sent once in 3 days, the contents and frequencies varied as per the patients' preferences. The study duration was 1 year. All participants were advised to report for quarterly clinic visits. A comparative assessment of the clinical, biochemical and anthropometric outcomes was made among the groups at the annual visit.",
        "Annual review was possible in 71% of intervention group and 63% of control group. SMS was acceptable to the patients and the median number requested was 2 per week. HbA1c and plasma lipids improved significantly in the SMS group.",
        "The pilot study showed that frequent communication via SMS was acceptable to diabetic patients and it helped to improve the health outcomes."
