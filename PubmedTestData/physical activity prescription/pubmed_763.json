        "Physical activity is an integral part of the obesity treatment. Curiously, even among health professionals, the evaluation of obesity treatment persists only based on weight loss. However, the treatment of obesity is not only a simple weight loss, but above all the treatment of associated diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc. Physical fitness is very rarely assessed, although it best predicts the future and reduces mortality from all causes. It is mainly a cardiovascular disease, where it is shown that the parameter VO2Max is the strongest predictor of not only cardiovascular mortality. The specifics of the prescription of physical activity bring with it the presence not only of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, but also osteoarthritis, possibly undergoing bariatric surgery. To objectify physical activity, including subjective symptoms, it is appropriate to use modern methods of telemedicine, which is the future in the treatment of not only obesity."
