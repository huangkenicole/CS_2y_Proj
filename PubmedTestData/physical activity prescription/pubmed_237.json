        "Cross-sectional studies have found a correlation between the duration or volume of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and steps per day (STEP), but there is little information on why this relationship varies among individuals. No previous research has established whether STEP can be used to estimate the duration of physical activity (PA) at or above lactate threshold (\u2265LT), such as for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. This study explored the association among STEP, MVPA indices, and \u2265LT under free-living conditions. Seventy young adult women measured their PA for 7 days using a validated accelerometer. The mean LT measured by an exercise test was 5.8 \u00b1 1.0 METs. STEP, MVPA, METs\u00d7h, and \u2265LT were 9324 \u00b1 2677 steps/day, 231.9 \u00b1 101.5 min/week, 16.6 \u00b1 7.4 METs\u00d7h/week and 24.0 \u00b1 22.2 min/week, respectively. Significant correlations were found between STEP and MVPA duration and between STEP and METs\u00d7h/week (<i>r</i> = 0.81 and <i>r</i> = 0.81); however, approximately 1600 steps/day of the standard error of estimates in the regression equations were found. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that the percentage of total time spent at light-intensity PA (LPA) and MVPA were significant determinants of the percent deviation of STEP from the linear relationships between STEP and MVPA indices. No significant relationship was observed between \u2265LT and STEP. The association between STEP and MVPA fluctuated depending on individual daily LPA and MVPA. Thus, consideration of both STEP and the PA at specific intensities are necessary to ensure the PA guidelines are met and the health benefits gained. STEP alone would be not a sufficient indicator for assessing the \u2265LT."
