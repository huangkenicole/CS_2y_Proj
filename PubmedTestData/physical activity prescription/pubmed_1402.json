        "The authors systematically reviewed and summarized exercise trials in persons with lung cancer on (a)\u00a0attention to the principles of exercise training (specificity, progression, overload, initial values, reversibility, and diminishing returns); (b)\u00a0methodological reporting of FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type) components; and (c)\u00a0reporting on participant adherence to prescribed FITT. Randomized controlled trials of exercise that reported on \u22651 physical fitness, physical function, or body composition outcome in persons with lung cancer were included. Of 20 trial arms, none incorporated all principles of exercise training. Specificity was included by 95%, progression by 45%, overload by 75%, and initial values by 80%, while one trial arm applied reversibility and diminishing returns. Fourteen interventions reported all FITT components; however, none reported adherence to each component. Including the principles of training and reporting FITT components will contribute to better understanding of the efficacy of exercise for persons with lung cancer and inform evidence-based exercise prescriptions."
