        "Cancer treatments are based on specific anticancer chemotherapy. However, there is increasing interest in general aspects of care, which are increasingly evidence based.",
        "The importance of muscle mass is becoming increasingly evident. Its role is not only limited to the maintenance of physical performance and quality of life. In oncology, recent studies have shown a close link between sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and mortality as well as between sarcopenia and chemotherapy toxicity. To treat malnutrition and the lack of energy intake, nutritional support is considered, whether through the prescription of oral nutritional supplements, enteral nutrition or even parenteral nutrition. Scientific arguments are often absent and few studies have been carried out in patients with lung cancer.",
        "There are many experimental arguments and a few clinical trials that support using omega 3 fatty acids to modulate inflammatory reaction and to reduce its consequences on muscular proteolysis. The benefit of regular physical activity has already been proven in chronic respiratory disease and its use in association with nutritional support must be recommended in oncologic care.",
        "Given the increasing recognition of the role of muscle mass in cancer, the purpose of any nutritional support must be focused on increasing muscle anabolism and decreasing proteolysis."
