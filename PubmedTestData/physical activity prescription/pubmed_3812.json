        "To investigate effects of different intensity exercise prescription on visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor( Vaspin) mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue and plasma Vaspin concentration of elderly obese rats.",
        "SD rats as three stage of fattening divided the growth period, middle-aged and elderly, to establish rats model of elderly obesity, 6 natural growing aged rats were selected as blank control group, 18 elderly obese rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, 6 rats in each group: obese control group, low intensity exercise group, moderate intensity exercise group. Exercise prescription were 12 m /min \u00d7 15 min for each group, 4groups / times, rest between groups 5min, 60 min/time. 15 m/min\u00d715 min for each group, 4 groups / times, rest between groups 5min, 60 min / time. Vaspin mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR and Vaspin protein expression was measured by WB in visceral adipose tissue and plasma Vaspin concentration was measured by ELISA after exercise.",
        "After exercise intervention, (1) Vaspin mRNA(\u00d7103) expression:Obese control group(25. 761\u00b111. 581) was higher than the control group(12. 161\u00b15. 648). (P<0. 01), low intensity exercise group and moderate intensity exercise group((10. 482\u00b12. 668), (13. 478\u00b15. 115)) were lower than obese control group (P<0. 01), moderate intensity exercise group was higher than low intensity exercise group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0. 05). (2) Vaspin protein expression: Obese control group was higher than the control group (P<0. 01), low intensity exercise group was lower than obese control group (P<0. 05), but moderate intensity exercise group was higher than obese control group (P<0. 01). (3) Plasma Vaspin concentration: Obese control group((25. 000\u00b13. 767) ng/mL) was higher than the control group((23. 765\u00b13. 045) ng/m L), low intensity exercise group and moderate intensity exercise group((25. 637\u00b15. 240) ng/mL and (26. 422\u00b13. 4175) ng/mL) was higher than obese control group, but the difference were not statistically significant( P >0. 05). ( 4) Blood glucose and insulin sensitivity index: Blood glucose of obese control group was higher than the control group( P < 0. 01). Insulin sensitivity index of obese control group was lower than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant( P > 0. 05). Blood glucose of low and moderate intensity exercise groups were lower than obese control group( P < 0. 05), but insulin sensitivity index of low and moderate intensity exercise groups were higher than obese control group( P < 0. 01).",
        "Vaspin mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue and plasma Vaspin concentration of elderly obese rats are higher. Low intensity exercise can reduce Vaspin mRNA and protein expression, but increase exercise intensity may improve Vaspin mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue and plasma Vaspin concentration of elderly obese rats."
