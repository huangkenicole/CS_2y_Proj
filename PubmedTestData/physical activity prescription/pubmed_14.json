        "The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions and practices around physical activity counselling and exercise prescription of dietitians in Nova Scotia. Dietitians (n\u2009=\u200995) across Nova Scotia completed an online self-reflection survey regarding their current physical activity and exercise (PAE) practices. Most (51%; n\u2009=\u200948) reported no previous PAE educational training. Dietitians infrequently prescribed exercise to their patients (16%\u2009\u00b1\u200926% of appointments) or provided PAE referrals (17%\u2009\u00b1\u200924%). Dietitians reported moderate confidence (57%\u2009\u00b1\u200921%) performing PAE counselling and included PAE-related content in half of patient appointments (52%\u2009\u00b1\u200931%). Almost all respondents (95%) identified interest in further PAE education or training. Open-ended responses also demonstrated the need for community-based exercise programs (28% of providers) and qualified exercise professionals to refer to (25%). Overall, dietitians report rarely providing patients with written exercise prescriptions or referrals to other professionals for PAE content but do frequently include PAE in patient appointments. Dietitians in Nova Scotia are well positioned to promote PAE, but more educational training and improved referral systems to qualified exercise professionals or community exercise programs is strongly desired. Exercise professionals and dietitians should concurrently advocate for these changes and collaborate to help more patients lead physically active lifestyles."
