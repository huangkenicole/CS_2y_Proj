        "Mortality and morbidity rates related to prescription opioid analgesics have been rising in North America and may be a gateway to the nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NUPO). The purpose of this study was to explore correlates of NUPO in the adolescent population given the scarce literature in this area.",
        "Cross-sectional data from 10,163 middle- and high-school students (15.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.8 years old; 57.0% female; 55.6% White ethnic background) in Ontario were derived from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey. Potential correlates of NUPO in the past year included sociodemographic, behavioral, parental, and school characteristics.",
        "Overall prevalence of NUPO was 10.7%. In the final multivariable model, NUPO was significantly associated with 8 of the 21 correlates examined. Students who used prescription opioids nonmedically were of black, South Asian, and \"other\" ethnic backgrounds (OR 2.83, OR 1.77, and OR 1.67, respectively); reported a lower subjective socioeconomic status (OR 0.92), lower parental support (OR 0.90), and lower academic performance (OR 0.86); met physical activity recommendations (OR 1.48); consumed energy drinks (OR 1.42); smoked tobacco cigarettes (OR 2.33); and used cannabis (OR 1.84).",
        "Findings from this study show a wide variety of correlates of NUPO among Canadian adolescents, and highlight the need for further research and the value in targeted prevention and multi-level intervention programs for NUPO in this population."
