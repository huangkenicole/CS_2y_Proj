        "The aim of this investigation was to use a validated lactate minimum test protocol and evaluate whether blood lactate responses and the lactate minimum power are influenced by the starting power (study 1) and 1 min inter-stage rest intervals (study 2) during the incremental phase. Study 1: 8 subjects performed a lactate minimum test comprising a lactate elevation phase, recovery phase, and incremental phase comprising 5 continuous 4 min stages with starting power being 40% or 45% of the maximum power achieved during the lactate elevation phase, and with power increments of 5% maximum power. Study 2: 8 subjects performed 2 identical lactate minimum tests except that during one of the tests the incremental phase included 1 min inter-stage rest intervals. The lactate minimum power was lower when the incremental phase commenced at 40% (175\u00b129 W) compared to 45% (184\u00b130 W) maximum power (p<0.01), and was increased when 1 min inter-stage rest intervals were included during the incremental phase (192\u00b125 vs. 200\u00b126 W, p<0.01). In conclusion, changes in lactate minimum power were small and thus unlikely to compromise test validity and therefore training status evaluation and exercise prescription."
