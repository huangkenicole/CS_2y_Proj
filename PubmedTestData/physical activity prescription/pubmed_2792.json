        "This was an observational survey of aggregate data, collected from CR facilities on a voluntary basis. Snapshots of a single working day at a local site were made, in terms of characteristics of patients and ET programmes delivered.\u00a0RESULTS. Overall, 612 patients from 26 CR units were included, with an in-patient vs. out-patient ratio of 3:1. Coronary artery disease (57.6%), heart failure (20.3%), and valve disease/surgery (22.1%) were the most represented target groups. The prevalence of endurance continuous training, interval training, and resistance/strength training was 66.7%, 11.1%, and 9.0%; other non-aerobic endurance and non-resistance training modalities such as respiratory muscle training and calisthenics were reported in 39.9% and 42.9% of cases respectively. Workloads for endurance exercise training were determined by cardiopulmonary test, conventional 12-leads ECG exercise testing, 6min-walking test, theoretical determination of heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion in 9%, 8%, 27%, 9%, and 40% of cases respectively. The average duration of the programmes (on an intention to treat basis) was 25 sessions of 42\u00b111\u00a0 minutes, with a frequency of &gt;4 sessions/week in 67% of patients.",
        "Despite advances in CR interventions, there is a significant need for improvement of functional evaluation and exercise training prescription, and consideration of a wider range of training modalities in Italy.\u2003."
