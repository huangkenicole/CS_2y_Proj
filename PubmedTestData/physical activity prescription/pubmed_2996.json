        "Aerobic exercise training (AER) may promote several adaptations in white adipose tissue (WAT), including a phenotypic change known as browning. The present study aimed at assessing if resistance exercise training (RES) would be as efficient as AER in inducing a brown-like adipocyte reprogramming in WAT. Thirty Swiss male mice were randomly divided into 3 groups with 10 animals each: <i>1</i>) sedentary (SED), <i>2</i>) AER, and <i>3</i>) RES. After the adaptation training, an incremental test was performed at the beginning of each week to adjust training load. Mice were submitted to 8 wk of AER or RES. After the experimental period, inguinal and retroperitoneal WAT (iWAT and rpWAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were collected. The prescription of AER and RES was effective in increasing the performance of both groups. Also, RES presented a lower body weight than AER/SED. AER and RES reduced the area of iWAT and rpWAT adipocytes and the lipid area of BAT, induced an increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and increased the expression of selective genes of brown and beige phenotype in adipocytes after 8 wk. In general, we demonstrated here that AER and RES training similarly induced the browning of iWAT and rpWAT.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Aerobic exercise training (AER) induces the browning of white adipose tissue, turning adipocytes multilocular, highly vascularized and expressing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). The current study compared the efficiency of resistance to aerobic exercise training to promote a brown-like phenotype. Our results suggest that both types of training similarly induce subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue browning."
