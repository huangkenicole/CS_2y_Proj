        "This study aimed to examine adolescents' acute cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and enjoyment responses following HIIE and work-matched continuous moderate intensity exercise (CMIE). Fifty-four 12- to 15-year olds (27 boys) completed 8\u2009\u00d7\u20091-min cycling at 90% peak power with 75-s recovery (HIIE) and at 90% of the gas exchange threshold (CMIE). Absolute oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), percentage of maximal [Formula: see text] (%[Formula: see text]), heart rate (HR), percentage of maximal HR (%HR<sub>max</sub>) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected during HIIE. Enjoyment was measured using the physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) following HIIE and CMIE. Boys elicited higher absolute [Formula: see text] during HIIE work (p\u2009<\u2009.01, effect size (ES)\u2009>\u20091.22) and recovery (p\u2009<\u2009.02, ES\u2009>\u20090.51) intervals but lower %[Formula: see text] during HIIE recovery intervals compared to girls (p\u2009<\u2009.01, ES\u2009>\u20090.67). No sex differences in HR and %HR<sub>max</sub> were evident during HIIE and 48 participants attained \u226590% HR<sub>max</sub>. Boys produced higher RPE at intervals 6 (p\u2009=\u2009.004, ES\u2009=\u20091.00) and 8 (p\u2009=\u2009.003, ES\u2009=\u20091.00) during HIIE. PACES was higher after HIIE compared with CMIE (p\u2009=\u2009.003, ES\u2009=\u20090.58). Items from PACES \"I got something out of it\", \"It's very exciting\" and \"It gives me a strong feeling of success\" were higher after HIIE (all p\u2009<\u2009.01, ES\u2009>\u20090.32). The items \"I feel bored\" and \"It's not at all interesting\" were higher after CMIE (all p\u2009<\u2009.01, ES\u2009>\u20090.46). HIIE elicits a maximal cardiorespiratory response in most adolescents. Greater enjoyment after HIIE was due to elevated feelings of reward, excitement and success and may serve as a strategy to promote health in youth."
