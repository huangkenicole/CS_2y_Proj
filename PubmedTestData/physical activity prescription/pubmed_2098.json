        "OMNI ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and physiological responses in children (n=7 boys, 8 girls, 11.1\u00b11.0 years) were examined during estimation (graded exercise test [GXT] and steady-state) and production (steady-state) trials on a cycle ergometer. Peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) was determined via a GXT with RPE estimated every 30\u2009s. Later, two 6-min trials were completed: Participants 1) estimated RPE at ~75% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak, 2) produced a level of exertion corresponding to their RPE at ~75% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak during the GXT. Data analysis included a one-way MANOVA and a paired t-test. The target intensity during the GXT corresponded to 74.2\u00b12.5% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak; the steady-state estimation and production trials were performed at 76.5\u00b12.7% and 68.5\u00b114.1% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak, respectively (p>0.05). Mean RPE at ~75% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak during the GXT and production trial was 6.7\u00b11.5; during the steady-state estimation trial RPE was 5.8\u00b12.0 (p>0.05). There were no differences (p>0.05) in the physiological responses. Participants estimated RPE similarly at ~75% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak during both graded and steady-state exercise, but when asked to produce a given RPE, marked variability was observed in physiological responses. These findings may have implications in optimizing exercise prescriptions for children."
