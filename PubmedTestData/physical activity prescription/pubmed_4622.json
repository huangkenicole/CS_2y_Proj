        "We review recent work on applications of non-pharmacologic strategies to promote cognitive health in older adulthood and discuss potential network mechanisms, limitations, and considerations for improving intervention uptake and efficacy.",
        "In healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment, cognitive training produces global and domain-specific cognitive gains, though effect sizes tend to be modest and transfer is variable. Non-invasive brain stimulation has shown moderate success in enhancing cognitive function, though the optimum approach, parameters, and cortical targets require further investigation. Physical activity improves cognitive functions in late life, with emerging trials highlighting key intervention components that may maximize treatment outcomes. Multimodal interventions may be superior to single-component interventions in conferring cognitive gains, although interpretation is limited by modest sample sizes and variability in training components and parameters. Across modalities, individual differences in patient characteristics predict therapeutic response. These interventions may advance cognitive health by modulating functional networks that support core cognitive abilities including the default mode, executive control, and salience networks. Effectiveness of cognitive enhancement strategies may be increased with clinician-led coaching, booster sessions, gamification, integration of multiple intervention modalities, and concrete applications to everyday functioning. Future trials involving rigorous comparisons of training components, parameters, and delivery formats will be essential in establishing the precise approaches needed to maximize cognitive outcomes. Novel studies using patient-level clinical and neuroimaging features to predict individual differences in training gains may inform the development of personalized intervention prescriptions to optimize cognitive health in late life."
