        "Wilfley, Hayes, Balantekin, Van Buren, and Epstein (2018) provided an important review of behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adults. Although behavioral change interventions are effective in increasing the frequency of exercise behaviors, behavioral treatment providers may not be experts regarding how fundamental movement/motor skills (FMS) deficits (e.g., ability to run, skip, balance, leap, kick, throw, catch, bounce) may hinder obese children from achieving physical activity goals. Prerequisite knowledge and skills are necessary to perform new target behaviors such as increasing physical activity, and exercise physiologists are best positioned to provide individualized exercise prescriptions to improve movement competence. Similar to psychologists and other behavioral treatment providers, exercise physiologists conduct their exercise interventions using an individualized, skills-building approach; by working collaboratively, behavioral health providers and exercise physiologists can develop integrative behavioral treatment plans to improve skills (both cognitive-behavioral and FMS) that may increase physical activity and improve health outcomes in children with obesity.
