      "AbstractText": [
        "Physical activity (PA) is important for the long-term health and weight management of patients who undergo metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). However, the roles of exercise professionals in MBS settings have not been systematically determined.",
        "To investigate: (1) who are the professionals implementing PA programming in MBS clinical settings; and (2) what patient-centric tasks do they perform?",
        "Clinical and academic exercise settings worldwide.",
        "This multimethod study included a scoping review of PA programs in MBS described in the research literature. Data about job tasks were extracted and provided to 10 experts to sort into categories. Cluster analysis was utilized to find the hierarchical structure of tasks. A Delphi process was used to agree on a final model.",
        "The majority of PA professionals were exercise physiologists in the USA and physiotherapists or other types of exercise professionals elsewhere. Forty-three tasks were identified, the most reported being supervision of exercise, fitness testing, and exercise prescription. Seven higher-order categories were determined: (1) Exercise-related health assessment, (2) Body composition and physical fitness assessment, (3) Lifestyle physical activity and sedentary behavior assessment, (4) Education, instruction, and prescription, (5) Exercise monitoring, (6) Behavioral counseling and psychosocial support, and (7) Dietary support. The following statements were rated an average of 9.0, classifying them as \"imperative\": 1) \"Pre- and postoperative PA/exercise guidelines for MBS patients are needed\", 2) \"MBS programs need to include PA/exercise as part of multidisciplinary care\".",
        "The expert group reached a consensus on 7 major classifications of job tasks for the exercise professional. It is important for governing medical associations across the world to formally recognize experienced exercise professionals as playing pivotal roles in continuing, multidisciplinary care for MBS patients. These findings also provide evidence-based information in the effort to solidify these positions within the greater context of healthcare."
