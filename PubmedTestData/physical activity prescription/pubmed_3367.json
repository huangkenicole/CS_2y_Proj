        "The aim of this study was to quantify the motion demands of match-play in elite U12 to U16 age-group soccer players. Altogether, 112 players from two professional soccer clubs at five age-group levels (U12-U16) were monitored during competitive matches (n\u00a0=\u00a014) using a 5\u00a0Hz non-differential global positioning system (NdGPS). Velocity thresholds were normalized for each age-group using the mean squad times for a flying 10\u00a0m sprint test as a reference point. Match performance was reported as total distance, high-intensity distance, very high-intensity distance, and sprint distance. Data were reported both in absolute (m) and relative (m\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0min(-1)) terms due to a rolling substitute policy. The U15 (1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0s) and U16 (1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0s) players were significantly quicker than the U12 (1.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0s), U13 (1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0s), and U14 (1.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0s) players in the flying 10\u00a0m sprint test (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The U16 age-group covered significantly more absolute total distance (U16 > U12, U13, U14), high-intensity distance (U16 > U12, U13, U14, U15), very high-intensity distance (U16 > U12, U13), and sprint distance (U16 > U12, U13) than their younger counterparts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When the data are considered relative to match exposure, few differences are apparent. Training prescription for youth soccer players should consider the specific demands of competitive match-play in each age-group."
