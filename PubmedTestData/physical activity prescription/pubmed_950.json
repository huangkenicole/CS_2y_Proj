        "Quevedo-Jerez, K, Gil-Rey, E, Maldonado-Mart\u00edn, S, and Herrero-Rom\u00e1n, F. Exercise-intensity adherence during aerobic training and cardiovascular response during resistance training in cancer survivors. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2338-2345, 2021-Combined aerobic-resistance training has shown the best benefits has proved beneficial for cancer survivors (CS). To understand the adherence to the aerobic training program (in terms of the intensity and duration of the sessions) and the cardiovascular response to the resistance training program, heart rate (HR) of 48 CS was monitored in each training session with an HR monitor for a 2-year period. During aerobic training, CS had to maintain the intensity in zone 2 (Z2) (between the ventilatory threshold and respiratory compensation point). The time spent below Z2 (Z1), in Z2, and above Z2 (Z3) was assessed in both aerobic and resistance training. The exercise-intensity distribution (aerobic vs. resistance training) was as follows: Z1 6.6 \u00b1 12.8% vs. 34.3 \u00b1 29.9% (p < 0.001); Z2 66.6 \u00b1 29.3% vs. 54.5 \u00b1 27.6% (p < 0.05); and Z3 26.9 \u00b1 29.9% vs. 11.2 \u00b1 20.6% (p < 0.001). The most deconditioned CS (<4.5 metabolic equivalents [METs]) presented the poorest adherence in Z2 and spent the most time in Z3. A significant positive moderate-high correlation was found for the percentage of time in Z3 between resistance and aerobic exercise (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the individualization of exercise intensity resulted in good adherence to the prescribed intensity. Less fit CS needed more supervision in their training sessions. Resistance training allowed the CS to train in moderate-vigorous intensities of cardiovascular response. Resistance training should have more scope in exercise prescriptions, particularly in deconditioned CS and in the first steps of exercise programs."
