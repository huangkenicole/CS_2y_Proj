        "Previous studies have reported beneficial effects of chronic resistance exercise in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. To clarify potential modulators of acute responses to resistance exercise, we reviewed the literature to determine the effects of a single bout of resistance exercise on cardiometabolic risk factors in type 2 diabetes.",
        "Pubmed and Embase were searched for studies investigating the effects of single bouts of resistance exercise on glucose and insulin levels, and cardiovascular disease risk in people with diabetes. Fourteen reports were identified and reviewed to formulate evidence-based resistance exercise prescription recommendations.",
        "Glucose and insulin levels appear to decrease with resistance exercise with effects lasting up to 24 and 18\u202fh, respectively. Bouts of resistance exercise may outperform aerobic exercise in reducing ambulatory blood pressure, with effects lasting up to 24\u202fh. Moreover, resistance exercise after rather than before a meal may be more effective in reducing glucose, insulin, and triacylglycerol levels. However, reducing injectable insulin dosage prior to resistance exercise may blunt its favorable effects on glucose levels.",
        "This review suggests that a single bout of resistance exercise may be effective for acutely improving cardiometabolic markers in people with diabetes."
