        "There is strong evidence that physical activity (PA) counselling from a health professional (HPs) leads to increased PA of their patients. Despite this, there remains a large evidence-practice gap between HP knowledge of the contribution of physical inactivity to chronic disease prevention and management, and routine effective assessment and prescription of PA. This article will present evidence on the effectiveness of HP- PA counselling and suggested behaviour change frameworks that can be used by HP. Four case studies are provided as examples of programs integrated into current HP student and post-graduate training programs."
