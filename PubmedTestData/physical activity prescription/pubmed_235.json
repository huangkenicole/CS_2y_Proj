        "The purpose of this research is to identify the effectiveness of primary care-based interventions designed to increase older adults' physical activity (PA). Primary care was defined as a patient's main source of health care. Standardized mean difference effect size (ES) was calculated related to changes in PA levels in adults' \u226565. Moderator analysis was performed to explore the relationship between participant characteristics, interventions, interventionists, and ES. Overall mean ES 0.27 (95% confidence interval [0.15, 0.39], p < .01) was calculated for 25 two-group comparisons involving 4,685 total participants with a mean age of 75.08. There was little evidence to support counseling over exercise referrals. The use of theory or a pedometer did not modify the ES. PA interventions delivered in primary care are effective and can be delivered by other health-care providers working with the primary provider. Many different behavior change strategies may be used to promote PA."
