        "Physical activity (PA) and exercise are widely recognized as essential components of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention efforts and are emphasized in the health promotion guidelines of numerous professional societies and committees. The protean benefits of PA and exercise extend across the spectrum of CVD, and include the improvement and reduction of risk factors and events for atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD), cardiometabolic disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (AF), respectively. Here, we highlight recent insights into the salutary effects of PA and exercise on the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, including their beneficial effects on both traditional and nontraditional risk mediators; exercise \"prescriptions\" for ASCVD; the role of PA regular exercise in the prevention and treatment of heart failure; and the relationships between, PA, exercise, and AF. While our understanding of the relationship between exercise and CVD has evolved considerably, several key questions remain including the association between extreme volumes of exercise and subclinical ASCVD and its risk; high-intensity exercise and resistance (strength) training as complementary modalities to continuous aerobic exercise; and dose- and intensity-dependent associations between exercise and AF. Recent advances in molecular profiling technologies (ie, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) have begun to shed light on interindividual variation in cardiometabolic responses to PA and exercise and may provide new opportunities for clinical prediction in addition to mechanistic insights."
