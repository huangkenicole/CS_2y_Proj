        "Increased body weight is associated with an increased magnitude of foot pressures. Although body mass index (BMI) has been widely used in the assessment of obesity, BMI does not differentiate between muscle and adipose tissue, which may play an important role in characterizing walking patterns. The purpose of the study was to compare gait biomechanics between obese and weight-matched control group.",
        "Sixty male adults were assigned to a normal and obese group based on body fat percentage. Body compositions and BMI were measured by the bioelectrical impedance method. Plantar pressure and gait parameters were recorded with a force-distribution-measure treadmill system during walking at the preferred speed. Physical fitness assessment was also conducted to assess muscular strength, muscular endurance, maximum oxygen uptake, flexibility, and agility.",
        "Normal group displayed greater muscle strength, flexibility, and maximum oxygen uptake compared to the obese group. Foot-pressure measures indicated significantly greater peak pressure values for the front and rear of the foot in the normal group. Greater muscle strength was correlated with higher BMI and lower body fat percentage. A significant negative correlation between body fat percent and gait variables was also exhibited.",
        "The results demonstrated different force application patterns during walking between the obese and weight-matched control group, indicating a potential influence of body fat percent on foot pressure characteristics in walking. Therefore, a comprehensive classification of obesity, including body fat percent, should be administered for the prescription of safe physical activity."
