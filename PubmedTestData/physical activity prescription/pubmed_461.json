        "To explore the influences of slim exercise prescription on body fat mass, blood sugar and plasma resistin for overweight and obesity students.",
        "Subjects were 9 males and 13 females for simple overweight and obesity students of freshman and junior. The function capacity (FC) were defined after examine of body shape, physical function and exercise capacity. The slim goals and exercise projects were determined according to different objects. The exercise intensity was 60%-70% of FC and 13-15 levels of RPE. Exercise with each time was 60 min, exercise frequency was 5 times perweek, energy metabolism was 500-600 kcal at a time. The relative indexes were detected after 8 weeks.",
        "Implementing programmes of slim exercise prescription for 8 weeks, before and after the experiment in the males and females group. The weight, BMI, percentage of body fat (FAT%), waist and hip circumference ratio (WHR), body surface area (BS), fat indexes, the density of body for overweight and obesity the male and female students were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Body fat mass (FM) and blood sugar were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Plasma resistin of the male students were significant different (P < 0.01), but the female students were significant different (P < 0.05). Analysis of Bivariate Correlation was Pearson Correlation, plasma resistin and BMI, WHR the male students had correlation, but the female had no correlation.",
        "The exercise prescription was safe and sure, and could improve weight, BMI, FAT%, FM, WHR, BS, fat indexes, the density of body, blood sugar, plasma resistin in obesity without the diet control."
