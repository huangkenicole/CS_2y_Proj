      "AbstractText": [
        "Previous studies have focused on the order of endurance and resistance training when performing concurrent training (CT). However, no study has compared the effects of combined training with CT orders on inflammatory markers, muscular performance, and body composition in overweight and obese males. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of 12 weeks of CT and combined training on the aforementioned markers in overweight and obese males.",
        "Sixty middle-aged overweight and obese males (age 51 \u00b1 4 years) were randomly assigned into one of four groups: endurance followed by resistance training (ER; <i>n</i> = 15), resistance followed by endurance training (RE; <i>n</i> = 15), combined resistance and endurance training (COM), or control (CON; <i>n</i> = 15). Anthropometric, body composition, inflammatory marker, and muscular performance measurements were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks.",
        "FFM remained unchanged in all three intervention groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Reductions in FM in the RE group were significantly greater than in CON (<i>p</i> = 0.038). The increases in serum concentrations of adiponectin in the RE group were significantly greater than in all other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Increased serum concentrations of CTRP3 in all intervention groups were significantly greater than the CON group (<i>p</i> < 0.05); moreover, the increases in the RE group were significantly greater than CON (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Regarding CTRP5, the increase in RE was significantly greater than COM (<i>p</i> = 0.014). The RE group experienced significantly greater increases in CTRP9 than all other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the decreases in serum concentrations of CRP and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly greater in the RE group compared to CON and ER (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Vo<sub>2max</sub> in the ER group was significantly greater than COM (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and all interventions resulted in higher gains compared to CON (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The increases in leg press strength, chest press strength, lower-body power, and upper-body power in the RE group were significantly greater than in the COM group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, the increases in chest press strength in the ER group were significantly greater than COM (<i>p</i> = 0.023).",
        "Regardless of training order, CT improved inflammatory markers, body composition, power, and VO<sub>2max</sub>. Notably, our analysis indicated significantly greater improvements in adiponectin, CTRP5, CTRP9, CRP, and TNF-\u03b1 levels when RT preceded ET in CT sessions compared to other exercise training sequences. These findings suggested that the order of exercise training may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of CT on inflammatory markers, which has potential implications for exercise prescription and optimization of health-related training outcomes."
