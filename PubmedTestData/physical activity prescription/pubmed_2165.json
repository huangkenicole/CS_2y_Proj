        "Personal health record (PHR) systems let individuals utilize their own health information to maintain and improve quality of life. Using PHRs is expected to support self-management in patients with lifestyle-related diseases.",
        "The aim of this study was to identify predictors of the willingness to use PHRs among patients who are prescribed medications for lifestyle-related diseases.",
        "We recruited pharmacy patrons, aged 20 years or older, who had received at least one medication indicated for hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires regarding their previous diseases, awareness of health care, experience in using PHRs, willingness to use PHRs, and barriers to using PHRs. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models.",
        "Of the 3708 subjects meeting eligibility criteria, 2307 replies (62.22%) were collected. While only 174 (7.54%) participants had previous PHR experience, 853 (36.97%) expressed willingness to use PHRs. In the multivariate analysis, considering exercise to be important for health management (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.12-2.21; P=.009), obtaining medical information from books or magazines (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96-1.59; P=.10), and obtaining medical information from the internet (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13-1.87; P=.004) were newly identified predictors. These were in addition to known predictors, such as being employed, owning information terminals, and previous PHR experience.",
        "Patients who have an active and positive attitude toward health seem to be more willing to use PHRs. Investigating willingness should contribute to the development of more useful PHRs for self-management among patients prescribed medications for lifestyle-related diseases."
