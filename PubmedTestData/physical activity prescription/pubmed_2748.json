        "To provide a large reference material on aerobic fitness and exercise physiology data in a healthy population of Norwegian men and women aged 20-90 years.",
        "Maximal and sub maximal levels of VO2, heart rate, oxygen pulse, and rating of perceived exertion (Borg scale: 6-20) were measured in 1929 men and 1881 women during treadmill running.",
        "The highest VO2max and maximal heart rate among men and women were observed in the youngest age group (20-29 years) and was 54.4\u00b18.4 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) and 43.0\u00b17.7 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (sex differences, p<0.001) and 196\u00b110 beats\u00b7min(-1) and 194\u00b19 beats\u00b7min(-1) (sex differences, p<0.05), respectively, with a subsequent reduction of approximately 3.5 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) and 6 beats\u00b7min(-1) per decade. The highest oxygen pulses were observed in the 3 youngest age groups (20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years) among men and women; 22.3 mL\u00b7beat(-1)\u00b13.6 and 14.7 mL\u00b7beat(-1)\u00b12.7 (sex differences, p<0.001), respectively, with no significant difference between these age groups. After the age of 50 we observed an 8% reduction per decade among both sexes. Borg scores appear to give a good estimate of the relative exercise intensity, although observing a slightly different relationship than reported in previous reference material from small populations.",
        "This is the largest European reference material of objectively measured parameters of aerobic fitness and exercise-physiology in healthy men and women aged 20-90 years, forming the basis for an easily accessible, valid and understandable tool for improved training prescription in healthy men and women."
