        "To evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-directed osteoporosis screening program utilizing the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool on patient and physician behavior.",
        "Postmenopausal women 45 to 65 years with Achilles T score <-1.0 not receiving bisphosphonate therapy were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. All participants received a heel ultrasound and pharmacist education on risks of low bone mass. The intervention group received the FRAX and shared their results with their physician. Three months after screening, a telephonic questionnaire was administered to all participants.",
        "A total of 749 patients were screened, with 87 meeting the enrollment criteria (43 control and 44 intervention). Physician behavior was not different between the groups with respect to ordering vitamin D levels, prescription medication, or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan. A significant difference in vitamin D supplementation occurred between the 2 groups (P = .024). At follow-up, 72.2% of responding participants increased daily calcium intake and 76.4% started or increased physical activity.",
        "Physician behavior was not influenced by FRAX results in the intervention group; however, positive patient behavior changes occurred in both groups. Primary prevention efforts conducted through heel ultrasound screening and pharmacist consultation led women to follow-up; however, awareness still needs to be raised of the value of FRAX in osteoporosis prevention."
