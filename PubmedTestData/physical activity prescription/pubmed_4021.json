        "Nocturnal hypertension is clinically important for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), considering its strong correlation with cardiovascular events. We aim to test the hypothesis that the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, luseogliflozin, ameliorates nocturnal hypertension more effectively than a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor in patients with T2D.",
        "This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint parallel-group trial. Sixty participants with T2D and hypertension who have been treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor for more than 4 weeks and who have a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.0%-9.0% will be randomised based on age, body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c to continue taking their DPP-4 inhibitor or to switch to luseogliflozin 2.5\u2009mg once daily for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be performed twice at baseline and at the end of the study. All participants will continue their diet and exercise therapy, and the doses of concomitant medications will not be adjusted during the study. The primary endpoint is the effect of luseogliflozin on the mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during the night, as measured by ABPM. The secondary endpoints are mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during the night, 24 hours of SBP and DBP, daytime SBP and DBP, pulse rate, BP M-value, trough SBP and DBP for 1\u2009hour before the next dose, and other laboratory parameters. The sample size was calculated for a two-sided test at 90% power for the detection of a difference between treatments.",
