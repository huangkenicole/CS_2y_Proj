        "The new Industrial Safety and Health Law in Japan, published in 1988, not only has improved the protection of workers against hazards or other risk factors at work, but also has implemented the health promotion of workers. In order to improve their health, factors on workers' daily-lifestyle, including smoking, alcohol consumption, nutrition and exercise, have to be modified to increase well-being. As exercise is one of the most important factors in health promotion, a fundamental knowledge of exercise physiology and exercise prescription is essential for the occupational physician. As various staffs for evaluation and consultation of the workers' exercise ability are necessary, different Ministries and associations have made efforts to educate several kinds of staff members, including doctors for sports medicine, and exercise and/or fitness-instructors. The state of educational courses for the teaching staffs of exercise for health promotion is discussed."
