        "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a strong predictor of stroke, and physical inactivity is one risk factor for TIA/stroke. \"Physical activity on Prescription\" (PaP) can increase physical activity, but the effect of PaP after TIA has not been described. Our goal was to objectively measure the effect of PaP on physical activity and physical capacity, as well as self-rated health at 3 and 6 months after TIA.",
        "The primary outcome was moderate to vigorous intensities of physical activity objectively assessed by accelerometry. Secondary outcomes were steps per day assessed by accelerometry, physical capacity assessed by the 6-minute walk test, and self-rated health assessed by EQ-5D VAS.",
        "Eighty-eight individuals with TIA were randomized to an intervention group (n = 44) that received conventional treatment and PaP or to a control group (n = 44) that received conventional treatment alone. There was a 30% dropout among the participants at 6 months. No significant differences between groups were found in physical activity at 3 and 6 months. At 6 months, participants in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have improved their physical capacity than the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in self-rated health.",
        "PaP did not increase physical activity after TIA; however, there was an increase in physical capacity. The nonsignificant results for physical activity may be the result of a relatively high baseline physical activity level. The results may also indicate that prior studies suggesting that PaP increases physical activity overestimated effects because of the self-reported nature of the previous outcomes.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A134)."
