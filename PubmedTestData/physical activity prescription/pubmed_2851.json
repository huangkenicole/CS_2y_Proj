        "Height is inversely associated with an increase in arterial stiffness after habitual resistance exercise (RE). Considering that RE is performed during exercise prescriptions, the association between height and the acute effects of RE on arterial stiffness should be clarified. We investigated the effects of height on arterial stiffness following transient RE. Thirty-nine young Japanese men were studied under parallel experimental conditions [sham control (seated rest) and RE (5 sets of 10 repetitions at 75% of one-repetition maximum)], which were randomly ordered on two separate days. The subjects were divided into tertiles of height (each group, <i>n</i> = 13). The \u03b2-stiffness index (index of arterial stiffness), assessed by carotid pulse pressure and distension, was measured in all subjects. A significant interaction between time, height, and RE was found for the \u03b2-stiffness index (<i>P</i> = 0.01). RE significantly increased the \u03b2-stiffness index in the lower-height group (<i>P</i> < 0.001), but not in the middle- and higher-height groups. Height was negatively associated with an increase in \u03b2-stiffness index following RE, even after controlling the confounders, including exercise volume and changes in heart rate and carotid pulse pressure (<i>P</i> = 0.003). The mediation analysis demonstrated a mediating effect of carotid distension on the relationship between height and changes in the \u03b2-stiffness index. These results suggest that short height individuals have increased arterial stiffness following RE due to decreased mechanical distension, rather than through the widening of pulsatile pressure."
