        "The growing trend of prescription of reciprocal walking orthoses for children under the age of 5 years has created a requirement for a new design of orthosis in this category. In response to this new demand, a prototype orthosis for infants, incorporating a specially developed hip joint and manufactured as a rehabilitation engineering device within the provisions of the EC Medical Devices Directive, has been produced and tested. A design feature that strongly influences the efficiency of walking is the rigidity of the body brace structure. Monitoring the specific structural performance of the body brace intended for infants showed that it would equal or improve the stiffness achieved in an orthosis for adults. Additionally its strength was comparable with the adult design, which has proven to be safe and reliable in many years of routine prescription. Incorporation of the infant body brace within a complete orthosis provided a structure of more acceptable physical dimensions for these more diminutive patients. The orthosis showed no incipient sign of failure after 100,000 cycles of representative service loading equivalent to that imposed by a 20 kg (5-year-old) patient. The results of structural assessment and cyclic load testing confirm that the design of the orthosis sufficiently satisfies the statutory requirements for devices that are safe and fit for purpose to permit field trials with patients."
