      "AbstractText": [
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the medial (GM) and lateral (GL) heads of the gastrocnemius muscle during plantar flexion performed in standing or seated positions, and with a neutral or dorsiflexed ankle.",
        "The tr\u00edceps surae (gastrocnemius and soleus) is an essential muscle group that promotes propulsion during walking, running and tasks of daily living.",
        "Ten male volunteers (24.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6 years, weight: 75.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0kg; height: 1.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0m) performed ten repetitions of plantar flexion under four different conditions: a) standing position (SP); b) standing position with passive stretch of the gastrocnemius muscle (SPS); c) seated with the knee flexed (KF); d) seated with the knee flexed and a passive stretch of the gastrocnemius (KFS).",
        "The muscle activity expressed as the root mean square (RMS) was significantly higher for the GL in the SPS versus the SP condition, while there was no difference for the GM between conditions. However, for the KF condition, GM activity was significantly higher versus the KFS condition, which was not verified for the GL.",
        "Therefore, the standing position with passive stretching of the triceps surae may be more efficient in increasing the myoelectric activity of the GL. However, the sitting position without passive stretching promoted greater GM muscle recruitment. The length/tension relationship of gastrocnemius could be used as a prescription variable during rehabilitation or conditioning programs."
