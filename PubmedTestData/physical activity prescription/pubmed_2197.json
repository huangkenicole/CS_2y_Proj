        "The aim of this narrative review is to explore design considerations for effective neuromuscular electrical stimulation exercise prescription in cancer rehabilitation, with simultaneous consideration for fundamental principles of exercise training and the current state of the art in neuromuscular electrical stimulation technologies and application methodologies.",
        "Narrative review.",
        "First, we consider the key neuromuscular electrical stimulation exercise design considerations, with a focus on training objectives and individual training requirements and constraints for individuals with cancer. Here, we contend that concurrent, low and high frequency neuromuscular electrical stimulation exercise, individually prescribed and progressed may be optimal for enhancing physical function. Second, we review the appropriate literature to identify the most appropriate stimulation parameters (pulse frequency, intensity, duration and duty cycle) to deliver effective neuromuscular electrical stimulation in cancer rehabilitation.",
        "We propose an informed and innovative neuromuscular electrical stimulation exercise intervention design and provide practical information for clinicians and practitioners who may work with and implement neuromuscular electrical stimulation exercise in cancer.Implications for rehabilitationNeuromuscular electrical stimulation is an emerging technology in cancer rehabilitation to help provide an aerobic and muscle strengthening exercise stimulus.Neuromuscular electrical stimulation may help improve aerobic exercise capacity, muscle strength and augment quality of life.Current prescription in cancer lacks adherence to the fundamental principles of exercise training, which may negatively affect adherence."
