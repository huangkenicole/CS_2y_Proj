        "This study aimed to determine the extent to which people admitted to a private psychiatric inpatient unit access and utilise the gymnasium and individualised coaching with an exercise physiologist (EP).",
        "An audit of the medical record of 100 consecutive discharges and 60 individuals referred to an EP during the audit period was undertaken. Selected demographic information, physical health status, psychiatric diagnosis and routinely collected outcome data were extracted from files.",
        "Twenty-four percent of people discharged from the hospital had documentary evidence of having attended the gym. These people were noted to have used the gym regularly and had an exercise prescription documented on discharge. Those with substance use disorder were more likely to use the gym than those diagnosed with an affective disorder. There were no significant differences in outcomes between those who were noted to exercise and those who did not.",
        "Those who may most benefit from coaching around exercise in the context of hospital admission are not presently the individuals most likely to be referred to an EP. Standardised procedures for assessment, referral, exercise prescription and ongoing monitoring of activity and outcomes are recommended across the care continuum."
