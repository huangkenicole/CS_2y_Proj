        "Adherence to diet and exercise regimens significantly limits morbidity and mortality for cardiac patients. Research at six and 12 months post CR program indicates that healthy behaviours learned in CR are not sustained. However, little is known about the extent of adherence in the immediate program completion period.",
        "To determine CR participants' knowledge of their diet and exercise prescription and the degree of adherence two months after completing CR, and to examine demographic and clinical variables to identify relationships to adherence behaviours.",
        "Participants (n = 174) were recruited from Phase II CR over a one-year period. The Diet Habit Survey (DHS) and Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) scores were administered at admission, discharge, and two months post discharge. Structured telephone interviews were conducted to evaluate adherence behaviours. Spearman correlation was used to determine relationships between demographic and clinical variables and adherence behaviours.",
        "Repeated measures ANOVA showed DHS and DASI scores were significantly higher at discharge (p < 0.001) without significant drift at two months post program (p < 0.09). These scores were in contrast with low self-report of knowledge of dietary and exercise recommendations and adherence to dietary and exercise instructions. Lower knowledge about diet and exercise were correlated with employment (diet, p < 0.001; exercise, p < 0.025). Decreased dietary adherence was correlated with BMI (p < 0.005). Exercise adherence was correlated with gender (p < 0.021) and marital status (p < 0.042).",
        "Although CR participants gain and retain knowledge about necessary dietary changes and improve their exercise activity tolerance during CR, most fail to translate the information into health promoting behaviour changes beginning in the immediate discharge period. Research to identify methods that transform knowledge into lasting behaviour change post CR is needed."
