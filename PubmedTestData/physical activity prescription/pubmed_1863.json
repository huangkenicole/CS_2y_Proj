        "<i>Background and objectives</i>: Maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) is an important training and testing tool, especially in the context of evaluating intensity in exercise prescription; however, few studies have examined the validity of prediction equations of HR<sub>max</sub> in physically active female adolescents and the role of maturation level. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the differences between measured and predicted HR<sub>max</sub> in a sample of physically active female adolescents. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Seventy-one selected volleyball players (age 13.3 \u00b1 0.7 years, body mass 62.0 \u00b1 7.2 kg, height 1.72 \u00b1 0.06 m) performed a 20 m shuttle run endurance test, and the actual HR<sub>max</sub> was compared with Tanaka HR<sub>max</sub> ('208 - 0.7 \u00d7 age') and Fox HR<sub>max</sub> ('220 - age'). <i>Results</i>: A large main effect of assessment method on HR<sub>max</sub> was found (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>\u03b7</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.486) with Fox overestimating actual HR<sub>max</sub> by 6.8 bpm (95% confidence intervals, CI; 4.2, 9.3) and Tanaka underestimating actual HR<sub>max</sub> by -2.6 bpm (95% CI; -5.1, -0.1). The more matured participants had similar actual HR<sub>max</sub> (mean difference -2.4 bpm; 95% CI; -6.5, 1.7; <i>p</i> = 0.242, d = -0.28), difference Fox - actual HR<sub>max</sub> (1.5 bpm; 95% CI; -2.6, 5.6, <i>p</i> = 0.466, d = 0.17), and difference Tanaka - actual HR<sub>max</sub> (1.7 bpm; 95% CI; -2.4, 5.8; <i>p</i> = 0.414, d = 0.19) to the less matured participants. <i>Conclusions</i>: These findings suggest that age-based prediction equations of HR<sub>max</sub> developed in adult populations should be applied with caution in physically active female adolescents, and Tanaka should be preferred instead of the Fox equation."
