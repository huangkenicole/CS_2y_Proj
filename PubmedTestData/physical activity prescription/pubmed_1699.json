        "The succession of on-transient phases that induce a repetition of metabolic changes is a possible mechanism responsible for the greater response to intermittent training (IT). The objective of this study was to quantify [Formula: see text] fluctuations during intermittent exercise characterised by the same work:rest ratio, but different durations and identify which duration leads to the greatest fluctuations. Ten participants (24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0years; [Formula: see text]: 42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>) performed (1) an incremental test to exhaustion to determine peak work rate (WR<sub>peak</sub>) and oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), (2), and three 1 h intermittent exercises alternating work period at 70% WR<sub>peak</sub> with passive recovery period of different 1:1 work:recovery duty cycles (30\u00a0s:30\u00a0s, 60\u00a0s:60\u00a0s, 120\u00a0s:120\u00a0s). [Formula: see text] response analysis revealed differences in the fluctuations across the intermittent conditions despite an identical total energy expenditure. The sum of the cycle's nadir-to-peak [Formula: see text] differences (\u03a3\u0394[Formula: see text]) and the oxygen fluctuation index (OFI) were both greater in the 60\u00a0s:60\u00a0s condition (\u03a3\u0394[Formula: see text]: +38%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013% and +19%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018% vs. 120\u00a0s:120\u00a0s and 30\u00a0s:30\u00a0s, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; OFI: +41%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029% and +67%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062% vs. 120\u00a0s:120\u00a0s and 30:30\u00a0s, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). [Formula: see text] fluctuation analysis was successful in identifying the intermittent condition associated with the greatest disturbances: the 60\u00a0s:60\u00a0s duty cycle induces more [Formula: see text] fluctuations. The present findings also demonstrate that the selection of the duty cycle duration for submaximal intermittent exercise (70% of WR<sub>peak</sub>) prescription is of interest to produce high [Formula: see text] fluctuations."
