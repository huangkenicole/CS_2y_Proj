        "Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical intervention in elderly which can affect quality of life in the future of these patients. Aim of the study is to assess the quality of life of elderly males after inguinal hernia repair compared with a similar group of male patients without any operation.",
        "A group of 40 male patients between the age of 60-80, in time up to 2 years after Lichtenstein hernia repair was compared with the same age 50 healthy males not operated in previous 2 years by 2 questionnaires: international Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GQLI) and national Gerontologic Society Investigation Questionnaire to assess possible differences in their quality of life. Both groups were comparable and operation techniques were identical.",
        "Hernia repair resulted in 12 complications (30%): wound infections - 3, serous exudate - 1, chronic pains - 2, inflammatory infiltration - 4, loose sutures - 2. Overall GQLI score in hernia operation group reached mean 123.5 +/- 10.3 and in control group was 121.2 +/- 8.7 (p > 0.37). Gerontologic Society Investigation Questionnaire did not reveal any significant differences between both groups, however it presented rather sad existence of elderly men in our country, who being pensioners are self-limiting their activity on all fields. However, the profile of the hernia group seemed to comprise of people, who keep better physical activity, thus are motivated to be operated for inguinal hernia to keep them in a good physical shape. Some limitations of their postoperative activity were noted, probably because of medical advice or in fear of recurrence of hernia.",
        "Elderly patients operated for inguinal hernia have similar long term quality of life as a healthy population of the same age. Medical prescription to restrict the physical activity after hernia repair with a mesh should be limited to short necessary time especially in elderly. Further investigations are needed to elaborate methods of increasing activity of old men in Poland to moderate medical costs for this group."
