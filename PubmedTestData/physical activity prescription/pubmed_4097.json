      "AbstractText": [
        "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of myocardial infarction predominantly affecting women aged younger than 50 years. There is limited research addressing female and male SCAD survivors' experience of, or requirements for, support post-SCAD. This study explored what SCAD survivors wanted to support recovery.",
        "A qualitative study using semi-structured video and telephone interviews. Data were analysed through thematic analysis using the framework approach. We interviewed 20 participants (19 females) with a mean age of 54.6 (+/-SD 8.5 years). Three overarching themes encapsulated participants' views about support requirements. (i) Education and information. Participants thought healthcare professionals involved in diagnosis and supporting recovery required greater awareness of SCAD and the psychological effect of SCAD. They wanted accessible SCAD information immediately post-event and during the educational component of cardiac rehabilitation. (ii) Physical activity. Requirements were for advice tailored to individuals' specific needs, physical capabilities, and physical activity preferences. Participants suggested that utilizing wearable technology was helpful to encourage a safe return to activity. (iii) Psychosocial support. Participants wanted formal psychosocial support immediately post-event, during cardiac rehabilitation and in the longer term.",
        "Better healthcare professional training may improve diagnosis, and increase support and awareness of SCAD. SCAD support programmes should provide early SCAD specific education utilizing online sources, individually tailor physical activity prescription, offer wearable technology to support a return to being active, and provide short- and long-term psychosocial support. As SCAD is predominately a female condition, programmes should consider female physical activity preferences."
