      "AbstractText": [
        "Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been shown to be a predictor of endothelial dysfunction in patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., obesity). Circulating PTX3 concentrations are dysregulated in obese individuals and are elevated following acute aerobic exercise. High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has been demonstrated to be as effective as continuous moderate-intensity exercise in improving endothelial function, as indicated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (BAFMD), in patients with CVD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of acute HIIE on plasma PTX3 and BAFMD responses in obese individuals.",
        "Eight obese and six normal-weight young males participated in acute HIIE (4 intervals of 4\u00a0min at 80-90% of VO<sub>2max</sub>; 3\u00a0min of active recovery at 50-60% VO<sub>2max</sub>). Plasma PTX3 and BAFMD were measured prior to, immediately following exercise, and one and 2\u00a0hours into recovery.",
        "Plasma PTX3 concentrations significantly increased following HIIE, yet the PTX3 response to HIIE was significantly blunted in obese compared to normal-weight participants. While the kinetic responses of BAFMD were also significantly different in obese compared to normal-weight participants, similar increases above the baseline were observed 2\u00a0hours into recovery in both groups. Finally, plasma PTX3 concentrations were not associated with BAFMD at baseline or in response to HIIE.",
        "The utilization of HIIE may serve as a time-efficient exercise prescription strategy to transiently improve endothelial function, independent of elevated plasma PTX3 concentrations, in obese individuals."
