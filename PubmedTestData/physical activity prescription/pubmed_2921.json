        "The myocardial stress response to exercise is dependent on exercise intensity and thus understanding the molecular responses between various exercise intensity levels might aid in exercise prescription. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates a variety of cellular processes including inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis and cell growth/development. NF-\u03baB can be comprised of homo- and/or heterodimers formed from five distinct proteins: p50 (NF-\u03baB1), p52 (NF-\u03baB2), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. NF-\u03baB is located in the cytoplasm and kept inactive by inhibitory proteins but following the exposure to a myriad of stimuli, an activated NF-\u03baB dimer translocates to the nucleus and exerts transcriptional effects on upwards of 150 genes. To examine the activation of NF-\u03baB in the myocardium following exercise, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u2009=\u200924) were exercised by treadmill running at 20\u00a0m/min for 30\u00a0min or 30\u00a0m/min for 20\u00a0min. At 0, 2, or 24\u00a0h following exercise, animals were anesthetized, hearts excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of hearts were homogenized, protein concentrations determined and extracts assayed for NF-\u03baB activation (DNA binding activity) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Visual examination of EMSA autoradiographs revealed an enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in the hearts from exercised animals when compared with non-running controls. Subsequent supershift analyses using antibodies specific for NF-\u03baB subunits showed the higher intensity exercise was associated with p65 (RelA) in the activated NF-\u03baB complex while the NF-\u03baB complex in hearts from animals exercised at the lower intensity was comprised primarily of p50. These data suggest exercise is capable of activating myocardial NF-\u03baB and that a threshold for the activation of specific NF-\u03baB subunits may exist."
