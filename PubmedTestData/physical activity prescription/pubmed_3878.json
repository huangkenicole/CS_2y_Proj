        "Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is recommended as part of supportive care for patients with prostate cancer. It can assist in reducing treatment-related symptoms such as urinary incontinence. This literature review aims to discuss recent innovative findings on the pathophysiology of the male continence mechanism and implications for PFMT in radical prostatectomy.",
        "CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, Emcare and PsycINFO were searched until January 2020.",
        "Nurses providing supportive care for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy can engage in-clinic in the instruction and recommendation of pre- and postoperative PFMT and delivering guidance on home-based programs to promote motor learning.",
        "Optimal postoperative urinary incontinence outcomes are suggested to be promoted by preoperative PFMT. Training focused on the urethral and anterior pelvic floor muscle complex has been shown to facilitate mid urethral occlusion required for continence. Prescription of PFMT should be individualised, focusing on skill acquisition and motor learning, which is in line with recent knowledge developments in male pelvic floor anatomy."
