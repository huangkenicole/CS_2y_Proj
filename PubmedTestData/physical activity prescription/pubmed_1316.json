        "In ancient times Hippocrates described a disease, the 3rd phthisis, which seems to correspond to COPD and is mainly treated by walking, gradually increasing the number of steps until reaching 10,000 steps a day at the end of the initial period of treatment. The recent era began in the second half of the 20th century and ended in 2015, with an unusual Cochrane Library editorial in which it was stated that the accumulated evidence (statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in clinical signs, tolerance to exercise, quality of life, days hospitalization\u2026) on the effects of rehabilitation programs suffice to suspend research on the subject and to justify focus on new elements in the programs. It is essential, in fact, to establish uniform practical recommendations for the prescription of routine rehabilitation (number and duration of physical activity sessions, therapeutic education, re-training intensity\u2026). In addition, studies should be carried out on new practices: community or home rehabilitation, long-term rehabilitation, tele-rehabilitation."
