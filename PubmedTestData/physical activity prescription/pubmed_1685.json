        "To compare the acute effects of water-based aerobic-resistance and resistance-aerobic concurrent training (CT) sessions on energy expenditure (EE) during and postexercise in young women.",
        "Nine active women (24 [3]\u00a0y; 60 [5]\u00a0kg) completed 4 sessions: (1)\u00a0familiarization, (2)\u00a0aquatic maximal test to determine the heart rate corresponding to the anaerobic threshold, (3)\u00a0CT protocol with aerobic-resistance sequence, and (4)\u00a0CT protocol with resistance-aerobic sequence. Both protocols started and ended with the participants in the supine position for 30\u00a0minutes to perform resting and postexercise oxygen consumption measurements. The water-based resistance protocol comprised 4 sets of 15 seconds at maximal velocity, and the water-based aerobic protocol was performed at a continuous intensity (heart rate corresponding to the anaerobic threshold). EE measurements were calculated based on oxygen consumption and the corresponding caloric equivalent. Paired t test was used to compare the EE values between the water-based CT intrasession exercise sequences (\u03b1 = .05).",
        "There was no difference between the water-based aerobic-resistance and resistance-aerobic in total EE (330.78 vs 329.56\u00a0kcal; P = .96), EE per minute (7.35 vs 7.32\u00a0kcal\u00b7min-1; P = .96), and postexercise EE (63.65 vs 59.92\u00a0kcal; P = .50).",
        "The intrasession exercise sequence during water-based CT had no influence on the EE in young women."
