        "The cardiorespiratory, cardiac autonomic (via heart rate variability (HRV)) and plasma volume responses to varying sequences of high-intensity interval training (HIT) of consistent external work were investigated. Twelve moderately trained males underwent three HIT bouts and one control session. The HIT trials consisted of warm-up, followed by 12\u2005min of 15 s, 30 s or 60 s work:relief HIT sequences at an exercise intensity of 100% of the individual velocity at [Formula: see text]O2max (v[Formula: see text]O2max), interspersed by relief intervals at 60% [Formula: see text]O2max (work/relief ratio\u2009=\u20091). HRV was evaluated via the square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals (rMSSD) before, 1\u2005h, 3\u2005h and 24\u2005h after the exercise. Plasma volume was assessed before, immediately after, and 3\u2005h and 24\u2005h after. There were no substantial between-trial differences in acute cardiorespiratory responses. The rMSSD values remained decreased 1\u2005h after the exercise cessation in all exercise groups. The rMSSD subsequently increased between 1\u2005h and 3\u2005h after exercise, with the most pronounced change in the 15/15 group. There were no relationships between HRV and plasma volume. All HIT protocols resulted in similar cardiorespiratory responses with slightly varying post-exercise HRV responses, with the 30/30 protocol eliciting the least disruption to post-exercise HRV. These post-exercise HRV findings suggest that the 30/30 sequence may be the preferable HIT prescription when the between-training period is limited."
