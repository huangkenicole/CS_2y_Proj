        "Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal pain. Exercise is a core recommended treatment. Most evidence is based on muscle-strengthening exercise, but aerobic physical activity has potential to enhance clinical benefits. The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding aerobic physical activity to a muscle strengthening exercise leads to significantly greater reduction in hip pain and improvements in physical function, compared to a lower-limb muscle strengthening exercise program alone at 3\u2009months.",
        "This is a superiority, 2-group, parallel randomised controlled trial including 196 people with symptomatic hip OA from the community. Following baseline assessment, participants are randomly allocated to receive either i) aerobic physical activity and muscle strengthening exercise or; ii) muscle strengthening exercise only. Participants in both groups receive 9 consultations with a physiotherapist over 3\u2009months. Both groups receive a progressive muscle strengthening exercise program in addition to advice about OA management. The aerobic physical activity plan includes a prescription of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity with a goal of attaining 150\u2009min per week. Primary outcomes are self-reported hip pain assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0\u2009=\u2009'no pain' and 10 = 'worst pain possible') and self-reported physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function subscale) at 3\u2009months. Secondary outcomes include other measures of self-reported pain (assessed at 0, 3, 9\u2009months), self-reported physical function (assessed at 0, 3, 9\u2009months), performance-based physical function (assessed at 0, 3\u2009months), joint stiffness (assessed at 0, 3, 9\u2009months), quality of life (assessed at 0, 3, 9\u2009months), muscle strength (assessed at 0, 3\u2009months), and cardiorespiratory fitness (assessed at 0, 3\u2009months). Other measures include adverse events, co-interventions, and adherence. Measures of body composition, serum inflammatory biomarkers, quantitative sensory measures, anxiety, depression, fear of movement and self-efficacy are included to explore causal mechanisms.",
        "Findings will assist to provide an evidence-based recommendation regarding the additional effect of aerobic physical activity to lower-limb muscle strengthening on hip OA pain and physical function.",
