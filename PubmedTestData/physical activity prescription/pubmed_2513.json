        "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS),with increasing mortality year by year,has become a major public health problem in China.Exercise rehabilitation as an important part of the out-of-hospital rehabilitation for the patients with heart diseases can further reduce the mortality of patients on the basis of drug treatment.The available studies have proved that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is more effective and efficient than moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) such as walking and jogging on chronic cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure,stable coronary heart disease,and hypertension and has high security.According to the latest research,HIIT can reduce the platelet response,mitigate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury,and increase the exercise compliance of ACS patients more significantly than MICT.Moreover,it does not increase the risk of thrombotic adverse events or malignant arrhythmia.Therefore,HIIT is expected to become an important part of exercise prescription in out-of-hospital cardiac rehabilitation strategy for the patients with ACS."
