        "In no sector of therapeutics is the theory so simple as in weight control. The major gap lies in translating this theory into practice. In the final analysis, the answer lies in personal choice, because many diets seem to work, but not universally in all studies. A reduced calorie diet is obviously essential, although the composition remains to be individually tailored. For this, health care professionals must become \u201cpersonal trainers\u201d and realize the importance of lifestyle prescriptions with regard to diet and exercise in all consultations, fitting them to the needs of patient. It may be argued that medical practitioners do not have the necessary time or behavioral skills for these long-term interventions, which might be better handled by a team of other health professionals. Prevention is, of course, better than treatment, and therefore a major effort must be made to target children, from breast feeding to education throughout schooling. No more surveys are needed; \u201cwe know the enemy and it is us.\u201d In the words of the Lancet editorial concerning obesity: \u201cOur public health leaders must replace prevarication with imagination.\u201d"
