        "<b><i>Significance:</i></b> Elevated survival rates in young adult cancer survivors (YACS) are accompanied by high morbidity levels resulting in an array of unmet needs limiting full life potential. Physical activity (PA) improves physical, psychological, and social aspects of health after a cancer diagnosis. There are no standardized PA guidelines tailored to YACS. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand areas of clinical relevance/agreement on PA use and implementation in young adult (YA) survivorship care. <b><i>Aim:</i></b> To identify expert consensus areas on the assessment, prescription, and implementation of PA in YA survivorship care; identify areas of clinical relevance and endorsement of PA as a health optimization strategy in YA survivorship care. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A four-round modified Delphi study of international multidisciplinary experts (Round I/II <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200918; Round III <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200957, Round IV <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200945) in exercise oncology, symptom management, survivorship care, youth cancer care was conducted. Qualitative content analysis, descriptive statistics (% agreement, standard deviation, mean), and inter-rater reliability (Kappa) were calculated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Experts reached a consensus on clinical providers needed to assess, refer, and provide PA interventions, the need for guidelines, and essential care delivery system components to foster the integration of PA integration in YA survivorship care as a health optimization activity. <b><i>Conclusions/Implications:</i></b> Cancer care integration models should optimize the unique preferences, strengths, and developmental stage of YA affected by cancer. The study adds to the existing literature on multidisciplinary teams needed to provide clinical expertise and organizational support to foster PA integration into YA survivorship care."
