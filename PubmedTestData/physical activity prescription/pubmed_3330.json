        "<b>Purpose:</b> Establishing physiotherapists' management of people with rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to their promotion of physical activity, is important to ascertain if there are educational needs in this area. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Physiotherapists from three Irish Chartered Physiotherapy clinical interest groups (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009457) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online questionnaire hosted on SurveyMonkey<sup>(R)</sup>\u2122. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and sixty-eight (168/457; 37%) responded. Exercise prescription and education were the most frequent treatments, with 84% always/regularly providing same. Physical activity is a component of treatment with 52% always/regularly advising. In addition, 69% agree that physical activity is attainable, 68% safe, and 67% an important goal. However, 62% never recommend the appropriate guidelines, while 14% define physical activity according to frequently used definitions. There was a statistically significant association between longer years qualified and more years working with people with RA, when using guidelines to guide physical activity and exercise prescription. Low-intensity exercises were prescribed by however, 67% never provide high-intensity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Current practice is in line with guidelines in which, exercise therapy and education are considered as the mainstay. Promotion of physical activity is strong; however, two-thirds never recommend the appropriate guidelines, and only a minority defined physical activity correctly. The majority never prescribe high-intensity exercise. There is a need to develop education and training for physiotherapists in the promotion of physical activity in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Implications for rehabilitation Exercise therapy and education are considered as the mainstay in the physiotherapy management of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Those physiotherapists' who are qualified longer and have more experience working with people with rheumatoid arthritis use the relevant physical activity guidelines. Overall there is a need to develop education and training for physiotherapists in the promotion of physical activity in people with rheumatoid arthritis."
