        "Consumers in the US are exposed to unprecedented high levels of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) for prescription drugs, yet there is limited evidence regarding their effect on health-related intentions and beliefs.",
        "To provide evidence on the association of DTCA for prescription drugs with consumer health-related intentions and beliefs.",
        "This cross-sectional study recruited participants from a nationally representative sample of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomly assigned into 1 of 3 study arms: (1) exposure to DTCA for heart disease medications (treatment 1 [n\u2009=\u2009926]), (2) exposure to DTCA for heart disease medications with price disclosure (treatment 2 [n\u2009=\u2009921]), (3) and exposure to nonpharmaceutical advertising (control group [n\u2009=\u2009902]). Each study arm viewed five 1-minute video advertisements, totaling 5 minutes of advertising exposure. The 2 treatment arms viewed pharmaceutical advertising videos for 4 heart disease medications, and the control arm viewed nonpharmaceutical advertising videos. Participants then completed a survey questionnaire to measure medication- and lifestyle-related intentions and health-related beliefs and perceptions.",
        "Direct-to-consumer advertising for heart disease medications (treatment 1), DTCA for heart disease medications with price disclosure (treatment 2), and nonpharmaceutical advertising (control group).",
        "The primary outcomes included ordinal measures of medication- and lifestyle-related intentions, health-related beliefs, and brand perceptions.",
        "Among the 2874 included participants (mean [SD] age, 53.8 [7.1] years; 1549 [54%] male) \u03c72 tests confirmed that there were no statistically significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics across study arms. There was a positive association between DTCA and medication-related behavioral intentions, including intention to switch medication (marginal effect [ME]\u2009=\u20090.004; P\u2009=\u2009.002) and engage in information-seeking behaviors (ME\u2009=\u20090.02; P\u2009=\u2009.01). There was no evidence that pharmaceutical DTCA discouraged use of nonpharmacological lifestyle interventions that can help manage heart disease (eg, diet and exercise), and DTCA exposure also had a positive association with consumers' favorable perceptions of pharmaceutical manufacturers (competence: ME\u2009=\u20090.03; P\u2009=\u2009.01; innovative: ME\u2009=\u20090.03; P\u2009=\u2009.008). There was no evidence for differential associations of price disclosures in DTCA.",
        "In this cross-sectional study, results showed that brief exposure to pharmaceutical DTCA had a large and positive association with medication-related demand intentions with no offsetting negative spillovers on lifestyle-related intentions. Lack of associations with price disclosure in DTCA suggests that policy makers should consider alternative strategies to promote value-based decision-making for prescription drugs."
