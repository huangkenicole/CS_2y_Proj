        "To retrospectively characterize and compare the dose of exercise training (ET) within a large cohort of patients demonstrating different levels of improvement in exercise capacity following a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program.",
        "A total of 2310 patients who completed a 12-week, center-based, guidelines-informed CR program between January 2018 and December 2019 were included in the analysis. Peak metabolic equivalents (MET<sub>peak</sub>) were determined pre- and post-CR during which total duration (ET time) and intensity [percent of heart rate peak (%HR<sub>peak</sub>)] of supervised ET were also obtained. Training responsiveness was quantified on the basis of changes in MET<sub>peak</sub> from pre- to post-CR. A cluster analysis was performed to identity clusters demonstrating discrete levels of responsiveness (i.e., negative, low, moderate, high, and very-high). These were compared for several baseline and ET-derived variables which were also included in a multivariable linear regression model.",
        "At pre-CR, baseline MET<sub>peak</sub> was progressively lower with greater training responsiveness (F<sub>(4,2305)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a044.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.71). Likewise, average training duration (F<sub>(4,2305)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a010.7 P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and %HR<sub>peak</sub> (F<sub>(4,2305)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a025.1 P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, \u03b7<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.042) quantified during onsite ET sessions were progressively greater with greater training responsiveness. The multivariable linear regression model confirmed that baseline MET<sub>peak</sub>, training duration and intensity during ET, BMI, and age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significant predictors of MET<sub>peak</sub> post-CR.",
        "Along with baseline MET<sub>peak</sub>, delta BMI, and age, the dose of ET (i.e., training duration and intensity) predicts MET<sub>peak</sub> at the conclusion of CR. A re-evaluation of current approaches for exercise intensity prescription is recommended to extend the benefits of completing CR to all patients."
