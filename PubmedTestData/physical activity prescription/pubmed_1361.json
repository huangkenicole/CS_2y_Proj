        "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease that limits an individual's ability to walk. One potential way to improve physical activity for patients with PAD is an ankle foot orthosis (AFO). Previous research has found that various factors may influence an individual's willingness to wear AFOs. However, one factor that has been understudied is an individual's baseline physical activity level prior to wearing AFOs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the perceptions of wearing AFOs for 3 months among individuals with PAD according to their baseline level of physical activity.",
        "Accelerometer-derived physical activity prior to AFO prescription was used to classify participants into either a higher or lower activity group. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at 1.5 and 3-months after wearing the AFOs to assess participants' perceptions of using the orthosis. Data were analyzed by a directed content analysis approach, then the percentage of respondents for each theme were calculated and compared between higher and lower activity groups.",
        "Several differences were found. Participants in the higher activity group more often reported positive impacts from wearing the AFOs. Additionally, participants who were in the lower activity group more often reported the AFOs caused physical pain while participants in the higher activity group more often reported the device was uncomfortable during daily activities.",
        "Baseline physical activity levels may help to better understand barriers to wear and needed support to increase adherence to an AFO wear prescription, especially for patients with PAD with limited activity."
