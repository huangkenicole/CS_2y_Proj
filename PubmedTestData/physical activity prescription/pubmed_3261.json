        "Strong evidence supports the proximal combined with quadriceps strengthening for patellofemoral pain (PFP) rehabilitation. However, most reported rehabilitation programs do not follow specific exercise prescription recommendations or do not provide adequate details for replication in clinical practice. Furthermore, people with PFP have power deficits in hip and knee muscles and it remains unknown whether the addition of power exercises would result in superior or more consistent outcomes. Therefore, this study is designed to verify whether the benefits of a rehabilitation program addressing proximal and knee muscles comprising power and strength exercises are greater than those of a program consisting of strength exercises only.",
        "This study will be a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at university facilities. A minimum of 74 people with PFP between the ages of 18 and 45\u2009years will be included. The experimental group will engage in a 12-week resistance training program focusing on proximal and knee muscles using power and strength exercises. The control group will engage in a 12-week resistance training program focusing on proximal and knee muscles using strength exercises only. Primary outcomes will be pain intensity and physical function; and secondary outcomes will be kinesiophobia, self-reported improvement, quality of life, peak hip and knee torque, and hip and knee rate of force development. The primary outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, and after 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The secondary outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and immediately after the interventions. Therapists and participants will not be blinded to group allocation.",
        "This randomized clinical trial will investigate if adding power exercises to a progressive resistance training may lead to more consistent outcomes for PFP rehabilitation. The study will provide additional knowledge to support rehabilitation programs for people with PFP.",
