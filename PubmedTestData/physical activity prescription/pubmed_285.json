        "Patients with cancer almost universally report diminished health-related quality of life. Many patients experience persistent fatigue and most have below-average exercise capacities. Despite the publication of exercise guidelines for cancer survivors that encourage physical activity, few patients exercise on a regular basis. Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in early-stage malignancies. Exercise training has been demonstrated to decrease cardiovascular events in patients with cancer. In addition, regular exercise improves exercise capacity, reduces fatigue, and improves quality of life in cancer survivors.",
        "A 2019 American Heart Association scientific statement, endorsed by the American Cancer Society, provided a framework and rationale for partnering with existing multidimensional, interdisciplinary outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs to provide supervised exercise training and risk factor control services for patients with cancer and cancer survivors: cardio-oncology rehabilitation. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine has published recommendations for cancer exercise training.",
        "This article provides practical suggestions for incorporating patients with cancer into cardiac rehabilitation and for patient-specific exercise prescription. Illustrative patient case examples are provided."
