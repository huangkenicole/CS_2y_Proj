        "The Green Prescription Active Families (GRxAF) programme focuses on overweight/obese children and adolescents, and is family/whanau based. It is an intervention supporting lifestyle changes through weekly sessions (nutrition advice and/or physical activity), and goal setting for the family/whanau for up to 12 months.",
        "To describe the GRxAF programme in Taranaki and evaluate its reach and engagement, especially for those most at risk of obesity.",
        "Participant files for each referred child from May 2007 to December 2009 were reviewed. Baseline demographic data, programme graduation information, and weekly activity session attendance were collected.",
        "Of the 109 participants during the audit period, 39% were Maori , 57% New Zealand European (NZE), 3% Pacific, and 1% Other ethnicity. Mean age at entry was 10 (range 4-17) years. Mean duration of programme involvement was five (range 0-12) months. Overall, 33/60 (55%) of the participants completing the programme during the audit period graduated, having made steps towards healthy lifestyle change. In comparison with NZE (68%), a smaller proportion of Maori (40%) graduated (p=0.04). In comparison with those who attended no sessions, participants who attended any sessions were more likely to make positive changes (OR=3.65, 95% CI 1.24-10.8).",
        "GRxAF in Taranaki met a need for some obese/overweight children, but not for all families/whanau, especially those over-represented in childhood obesity statistics. Programme delivery for Maori requires improvement, and assessment of readiness to make lifestyle change as an enrolment criteria for all participants is recommended."
