        "Improvement in exercise tolerance is an important goal in cardiac rehabilitation, but improvement in quality of life (QOL) must also be considered. Therefore, we planned a non-supervised walking exercise program at home for 1 year in patients in the convalescent phase of myocardial infarction to study the exercise tolerance and QOL.",
        "Thirty-two patients (mean age 60.3 +/- 10 years, 23 men and 9 women) performed our non-supervised home exercise program in which the exercise prescription was based on the rating of perceived exertion. Before discharge, 1 month and 1 year after discharge, exercise tolerance was measured by the cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise test, and QOL was investigated by questionnaire.",
        "Anaerobic threshold increased from 15.8 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min before discharge to 17.5 +/- 3.0 ml/kg/min 1 month after (p < 0.05) and to 18.3 +/- 3.0 ml/min/kg 1 year after (p < 0.05 vs at discharge), and peak oxygen consumption increased from 22.2 +/- 4.3 to 25.2 +/- 5.1 ml/kg/min (p < 0.05) and to 26.4 +/- 5.2 ml/kg/min (p < 0.05 vs at discharge), respectively. QOL score by questionnaire was maintained in 13 patients (improved in 3, same in 10) and decreased in 19 of 32 patients from discharge to 1 month, and the score was maintained in 18 patients (improved in 13, same in 5) and decreased in 14 of 32 patients from 1 month to 1 year after discharge.",
        "In patients with myocardial infarction in the convalescent phase, our non-supervised home exercise program resulted in improvement in exercise tolerance, but QOL score decreased gradually. Therefore, we should not only prescribe an exercise program, but also must give more psychosocial support to the patients. The reasons for the decreased QOL by cardiac rehabilitation must be further investigated."
