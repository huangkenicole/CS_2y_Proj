        "The dispensing of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) in Jordan is still unregulated, and AAS are available without a prescription. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of AAS abuse among gym users and their knowledge, perception, and practices towards using these AAS.",
        "This cross-sectional study was conducted online in November-December 2022. Participants were recruited if they were adults attending any gym facility in Jordan.",
        "A total of 365 adult participants agreed to participate in this study. Concerning participants' knowledge about AAS side effects, the median knowledge score of the participants was 7.0 scores (Interquartile range=7.0) out of 15. Indeed, 14.2% of the participants (n=52) reported using AAS during their gym participation. Participants reported that the most common source for obtaining AAS was the gym trainers (n=38, 70.4%), and the most common reason for using AAS was to increase lean body weight (n=52, 96.3%). Also, among the AAS users, two-thirds reported having never experienced side effects after using AAS. Finally, regression analysis revealed that males had 3.35 times higher usage of AAS than females (OR=3.351, p-value=0.008).",
        "The findings of this study show a comparatively high prevalence of AAS use among gymgoers. Therefore, it is critical to have policies prohibiting their usage without a prescription. There should be more awareness about the negative effects of AAS in criminal activities, and it should be included in public awareness programs."
