        "The self-paced maximal oxygen uptake test (SPV) may offer effective training prescription metrics for athletes. This study aimed to examine whether SPV-derived data could be used for training prescription.",
        "Twenty-four recreationally active male and female runners were randomly assigned between two training groups: (1) Standardised (STND) and (2) Self-Paced (S-P). Participants completed 4 running sessions a week using a global positioning system-enabled (GPS) watch: 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0interval sessions; 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0recovery run; and 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0tempo run. STND had training prescribed via graded exercise test (GXT) data, whereas S-P had training prescribed via SPV data. In STND, intervals were prescribed as 6\u2009\u00d7\u200960% of the time that velocity at [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) could be maintained (T<sub>max</sub>). In S-P, intervals were prescribed as 7\u2009\u00d7\u2009120\u00a0s at the mean velocity of rating of perceived exertion 20 (<sub>v</sub>RPE20). Both groups used 1:2 work:recovery ratio. Maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), [Formula: see text], T<sub>max, v</sub>RPE20, critical speed (CS), and lactate threshold (LT) were determined before and after the 6-week training.",
        "STND and S-P training significantly improved [Formula: see text] by 4\u2009\u00b1\u20098 and 6\u2009\u00b1\u20096%, CS by 7\u2009\u00b1\u20097 and 3\u2009\u00b1\u20093%; LT by 5\u2009\u00b1\u20094% and 7\u2009\u00b1\u20098%, respectively (all P\u2009<\u2009.05), with no differences observed between groups.",
        "Novel metrics obtained from the SPV can offer similar training prescription and improvement in [Formula: see text], CS and LT compared to training derived from a traditional GXT."
