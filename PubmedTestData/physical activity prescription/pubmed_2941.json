        "The objectives of this article are to compare oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and perceptual responses between continuous and interval eccentric cycling protocols in order to test the hypothesis that metabolic demand and enjoyment would be greater for interval than continuous eccentric cycling protocols. Eleven recreationally active men (n\u2009=\u20099) and women (32.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 years) performed a concentric cycling test to determine peak power output (PPO) followed by five eccentric cycling protocols on separate occasions: continuous eccentric cycling at 60% of PPO for 20\u2005min at 60\u2005rpm (CONT<sub>20@60%</sub>) and 13.2\u2005min at 90\u2005rpm (CONT<sub>13@60%</sub>), 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2005min at 75% of PPO with 2-min rest (INT<sub>4\u00d74@75%</sub>), 12\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2005min at 100% of PPO with 1-min rest (INT<sub>1\u00d712@100%</sub>) and 10\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2005min at 150% of PPO with 1-min rest (INT<sub>1\u00d710@150%</sub>). Gas exchange and power output were recorded continuously, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and enjoyment were assessed after each exercise. Total VO<sub>2</sub> including the rest periods was the greatest (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) during INT<sub>1\u00d710@150%</sub> (382\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u2005ml\u2005kg<sup>-1</sup>) and lowest (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) during CONT<sub>13@60%</sub> (146\u2009\u00b1\u200927\u2005ml\u2005kg<sup>-1</sup>). Total VO<sub>2</sub> during INT<sub>1\u00d712@100%</sub> (312\u2009\u00b1\u200959\u2005ml\u2005kg<sup>-1</sup>) was greater (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) than CONT<sub>20@60%</sub> (246\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u2005ml\u2005kg<sup>-1</sup>) and INT<sub>4\u00d74@75%</sub> (257\u2009\u00b1\u200942\u2005ml\u2005kg<sup>-1</sup>). RPE was greater (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) after INT<sub>1\u00d710@150%</sub> (17\u2009\u00b1\u20092) than other conditions, but perceived enjoyment was not significantly different between protocols. It was concluded that the interval protocols increased metabolic demand without increasing RPE and enjoyment. It appears that high-intensity interval protocols can be used in eccentric cycling prescription."
