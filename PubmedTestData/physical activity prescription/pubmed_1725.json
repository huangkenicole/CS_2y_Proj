        "Excess visceral adiposity contributes to elevated cardiometabolic risk, and waist circumference is commonly used as a surrogate measure of visceral adipose tissue. Although regular aerobic exercise is known to improve abdominal obesity, its effect on waist circumference is unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine (1) the effect of aerobic exercise on waist circumference in adults with overweight or obesity; (2) the association between any change in waist circumference and change in visceral adipose tissue and/or bodyweight with aerobic exercise interventions; and (3) if reductions in waist circumference with exercise are moderated by clinical characteristics or components of aerobic exercise prescription. Twenty-five randomized controlled trials (1686 participants) were included. Regular aerobic exercise significantly reduced waist circumference by 3.2\u2009cm (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.86, -2.51, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) versus control. Change in waist circumference was associated with change in visceral adipose tissue (\u03b2\u2009=\u20094.02; 95% CI 1.37, 6.66, p\u2009=\u20090.004), and vigorous intensity produced superior reduction (-4.2\u2009cm, 95% CI -4.99, -3.42, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in waist circumference compared with moderate intensity (-2.50\u2009cm, 95% CI -3.22, -1.79, p\u2009=\u20090.058). These findings suggest regular aerobic exercise results in modest reductions in waist circumference and associated visceral adipose tissue and that higher intensity exercise may offer superior benefit to moderate intensity."
