        "The purposes of this study were to: (a) identify which determinants of physical activity among African American and Caucasian women predict adherence to a 24-week home-based walking program; and (b) explore differences between African American and Caucasian women. Participants were 153 working women who were sedentary at leisure. The program included an exercise prescription, instructions, and support. Background determinants included demographics, previous exercise experience, and social role influences. Intrapersonal determinants (self-efficacy, self-determinism) were measured at baseline and 24 weeks. Adherence was measured with heart rate monitors and logs. Adherence was significantly higher in Caucasians, those with less previous exercise experience, and those with higher self-efficacy. Findings suggest that adherence to a walking program is influenced by multiple factors including background and intrapersonal determinants of physical activity."
