        "Supervised exercise is beneficial for peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients limited by intermittent claudication (IC). However, supervised exercise for PAD remains widely underutilized. Mobile health (mHealth) provides an intermediate solution between supervised and independent home-based exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects on functional capacity and physical activity patterns of a 12-week mHealth program in PAD patients with IC. Twenty patients were randomized into usual care or a 12-week mHealth intervention consisting of patient education, smartphones, and physical activity trackers. Patient education was disseminated through smartphone and a daily exercise prescription was given based on steps per day. Primary outcomes were 12-week changes in peak VO<sub>2</sub> and claudication onset time; and changes in physical activity measured by steps per/day and minutes of exercise per/week. mHealth patients significantly increased peak VO<sub>2</sub> from 15.2 \u00b1 4.3 to 18.0 \u00b1 4.8 ml/kg/min (20.3 \u00b1 26.4%; p \u22640.05), while usual care did not change from 14.3 \u00b1 5.4 to 14.5 \u00b1 5.7 ml/kg/min (1.0 \u00b1 6.9%; NS). Comparison of these changes resulted in a significant difference between groups (p \u22640.05) for peak VO<sub>2</sub>. Claudication onset time significantly increased in mHealth (320 \u00b1 226 to 525 \u00b1 252 seconds; \u2264 0.05), while usual care demonstrated a worsening (252 \u00b1 256 to 231 \u00b1 196 seconds; NS). The comparison of these group changes resulted in a significant difference (p \u22640.05). Neither steps per day or minutes of activity reached significant differences between groups. In conclusion, a 12-week mHealth program in PAD patients with IC can improve peak VO<sub>2</sub> and claudication onset time; and mHealth interventions represent a promising alternative therapy for those patients who cannot participate in supervised exercise."
