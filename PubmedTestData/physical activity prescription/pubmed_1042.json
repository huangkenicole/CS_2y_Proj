        "Physical activity (PA) counseling by health professionals has promising results in behavior change. However, few studies have evaluated its prevalence in Primary Health Care in Latin American countries. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and analyze the associated factors of PA counseling in adults in Primary Health Care in Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 779 adults (70% women). Counseling was identified among those who reported having received PA counseling during a health professional consultation in the last 12 months. Sociodemographic factors, health conditions, and leisure-time PA were analyzed with Poisson regression. The prevalence of counseling was 43% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 39.5-46.4%), higher in people aged \u226540 years (Prevalence Ratio [PR]: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.19-1.75], who are married (PR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07-1.59), obese (PR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.23-1.90), take prescription medication (PR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.47-2.27), and walk for leisure (PR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06-1.54). People with more education were less likely to receive PA counseling (PR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.99). In conclusion, 4 out of 10 users reported receiving PA counseling and this was associated with sociodemographic factors, health conditions, and walking for leisure. These results can guide PA promotion in Primary Health Care."
