      "AbstractText": [
        "Although running traditionally relies on critical speed (CS) as an indicator of critical intensity, portable inertial measurement units offer a potential solution for estimating running mechanical power to assess critical power (CP) in runners. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CS and CP differ when assessed using the Stryd device, a portable inertial measurement unit, and if 2 running bouts are sufficient to determine CS and CP.",
        "On an outdoor running track, 10 trained runners (V\u02d9O2max, 59.0 [4.2]\u00a0mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) performed 3 running time trials (TT) between 1200 and 4400\u00a0m on separate days. CS and CP were derived from 2-parameter hyperbolic speed-time and power-time models, respectively, using 2 (CS2TT and CP2TT) and 3 (CS3TT and CP3TT) TTs. Subsequently, runners performed constant-intensity running for 800\u00a0m at their calculated CS3TT and CP3TT.",
        "Running at the calculated CS3TT speed (3.88 [0.44]\u00a0m\u00b7s-1) elicited an average Stryd running power (271 [28]\u00a0W) not different from the calculated CP3TT (270 [28]; P = .940; d = 0.02), with excellent agreement between the 2 values (intraclass correlation coefficient = .980). The CS2TT (3.97 [0.42]\u00a0m\u00b7s-1) was not higher than CS3TT (3.89 [0.44]\u00a0m\u00b7s-1; P = .178; d = 0.46); however, CP2TT (278 [29] W) was greater than CP3TT (P = .041; d = 0.75).",
        "The running intensities at CS and CP were similar, supporting the use of running power (Stryd) as a metric of aerobic fitness and exercise prescription, and 2 trials provided a reasonable, albeit higher, estimate of CS and CP."
