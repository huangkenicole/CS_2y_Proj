        "Exercise with self-selected intensity (SSI) has emerged as a new strategy for exercise prescription aiming to increase exercise adherence in Parkinson's disease (PD).",
        "We compared the cardiovascular, perceived exertion and affective responses during traditional aerobic exercise and with SSI in PD.",
        "Twenty patients with PD performed two aerobic exercise sessions in random order with an interval of at least 72\u200ah between them: Traditional session (cycle ergometer, 25 min, 50\u200arpm) with imposed intensity (II) (60-80% maximum heart rate [HR]) and SSI: (cycle ergometer, 25\u200amin, 50\u200arpm) with SSI. The HR (Polar V800 monitor), systolic blood pressure (auscultatory method), rating of perceived exertion (Borg scale 6-20) and affective responses (feeling scale) were assessed during the exercise at 8th and 18th minute. The Generalized Estimating Equation Model was used for comparison between both sessions (P\u200a<\u200a0.05).",
        "The exercise intensity was not significantly different between both exercise sessions (8th minute: II -76.3\u00b11.0\u200avs. SSI -76.5\u00b11.3 % of maximal HR; 18th minute: II -78.9\u00b10.9\u200avs. SSI -79.1\u00b11.3 % of maximal HR, p\u200a=\u200a0.93). Blood pressure, perceived exertion and affective responses were also not significantly different between both sessions (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).",
        "Cardiovascular and psychophysiological responses were not different during aerobic exercise performed with II and with SSI in patients with PD."
