      "AbstractText": [
        "Pre-operative exercise may improve functional outcomes for lung cancer patients, but barriers associated with cost, resources, and burden make it challenging to deliver pre-operative exercise programs. The goal of this proof-of-concept study was to determine level of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and change in aerobic capacity after participation in a home-based pre-operative exercise intervention.",
        "Eighteen patients scheduled for surgery for suspected stage I-III lung cancer received an exercise prescription from their surgeon and wore a commercially-available device that tracked their daily MVPA throughout the pre-operative period. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate adherence to the exercise prescription. A one-sample t-test was used to explore change in aerobic capacity from baseline to the day of surgery.",
        "Participants exhibited a mean of 20.4 (sd\u00a0=\u00a046.2) minutes of MVPA per day during the pre-operative period. On average, the sample met the goal of 30\u00a0min of MVPA on 16.4% of the days during the pre-operative period. The mean distance achieved at baseline for the 6-min walk test was 456.7\u00a0m (sd\u00a0=\u00a072.9), which increased to 471.1\u00a0m (sd\u00a0=\u00a088.4) on the day of surgery. This equates to a mean improvement of 13.8\u00a0m (sd\u00a0=\u00a037.0), but this difference was not statistically different from zero (p\u00a0=\u00a00.14). Eight of the 17 participants (47%) demonstrated a clinically significant improvement of 14\u00a0m or more.",
        "A surgeon-delivered exercise prescription plus an activity tracker may promote clinically significant improvement in aerobic capacity and MVPA engagement among patients with lung cancer during the pre-operative period, but may need to be augmented with more contact with and support from practitioners over time to maximize benefits.",
        "The study protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov prior to initiating participant recruitment (NCT03162718)."
