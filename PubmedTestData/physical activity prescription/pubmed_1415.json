        "Physical activity is important in lung cancer, yet the majority of patients do not meet minimum weekly recommended activity levels. The objectives of this study were to determine the: 1) feasibility and 2) exploratory effectiveness of a physical activity self-management program aiming to increase physical activity levels of patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.",
        "Prospective case series including patients with operable lung cancer. The physical activity self-management program, based on international cancer physical activity guidelines, commenced pre-operative (if recruitment occurred \u22657 days before surgery) or post-operative if not, and continued until 8-weeks after surgery. The program included prescription of an unsupervised home aerobic exercise program, taught in an initial face-to-face consultation and followed-up with weekly telephone consultations. This was supplemented with patient education, behaviour change techniques and provision of an activity monitor. The primary endpoint was program feasibility including consent rate and number of consultations delivered. In addition, self-reported physical activity levels, self-efficacy for physical activity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mood was assessed pre- and 8-weeks post-operative.",
        "The consent rate was 89%. Thirty-seven patients (54% male, mean age 66\u202f\u00b1\u202f10 years) were included. Only six participants commenced the program before surgery, with most (n\u202f=\u202f31) commencing post-operatively. The median [IQR] number of consultations was 4 [3-6] per participant. There was no change in physical activity levels (total estimated mets/week pre-operative median [IQR] 1066 [0-2772], 8 weeks post-operative 924 [346-1752], p\u202f=\u202f0.545) or sedentary time (television viewing hours/day pre-operative 4.5 [2.0-9.5], 8-weeks 4.0 [3.0-5.0], p\u202f=\u202f0.527) after surgery.",
        "The physical activity program was feasible when implemented in the post-operative setting. Participants in this feasibility study demonstrated maintenance in physical activity levels 8-weeks after surgery, compared with published literature reporting decline after surgery. A randomised controlled trial is warranted to further investigate potential effectiveness of this intervention."
