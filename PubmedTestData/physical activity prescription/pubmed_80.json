        "Physical activity (PA) improves quality of life and prevents chronic disease, yet many adults are inactive. Planning with health care providers in the form of exercise \"prescriptions\" may increase PA, but the role of individual psychosocial factors within exercise prescription programs is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe the role of self-regulation strategies (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring, reinforcements) in PA behavior change within the context of an exercise prescription program. Patients at a large, Federally Qualified Health Center with an on-site exercise facility (ie, \"Wellness Center\") referral were eligible to exercise with a personal fitness advisor. Self-reported PA and use of 15 self-regulation strategies were measured via survey at two time points and merged with electronic health records and attendance data. Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0151) were, on average, 50.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3\u00a0years and mostly female (76.8%). Almost one-third (30.5%) were Hispanic/Latino, 48.3% were non-Hispanic Black, and 20.5% were non-Hispanic white. Participants completed 10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0 in-person exercise sessions with a fitness advisor. Between baseline and follow-up, the self-regulation strategies that had the largest change in frequency over time were keeping track of PA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), thinking about surroundings (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), rewarding yourself for PA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), making PA more enjoyable (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), setting goals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and trying different kinds of PA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Among exercise prescription program participants, the total self-regulation strategies score was significantly associated with physical activity at follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Leveraging self-regulatory skill-building activities within the context of exercise prescription programs in clinical settings may provide a personalized and multicomponent approach to PA promotion. Self-regulation strategy training for fitness advisors and/or health care providers has great potential for supporting long-term health behaviors like PA for managing chronic disease among underserved patients."
