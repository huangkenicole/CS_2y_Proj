      "AbstractText": [
        "Concussion diagnosis and rehabilitation management has become a prevalent area of research, and yet much is still unknown about these complex injuries. Historically, exercise prescription post-concussion was conservatively used for rehabilitation due to the suspected harmful effects that exercise can have on damaged neurons, and increase in symptoms. However, there has been a shift to implement exercise earlier into recovery as several studies have demonstrated positive outcomes.",
        "The objective of this literature review is to update the reader about new advances in concussion research related to the beneficial effects of physical activity from both a neurometabolic and a broader physiological perspective, using gene expression as a vehicle to demonstrate why and how physical activity has the capacity to optimize recovery from a cellular perspective. To further this clinical guideline, the evidence must continue to support these positive outcomes from an inductive and deductive physiologic approach (i.e., the clinical evidence aligned from a micro- to macroscopic approach and vice versa).",
        "Narrative review.",
        "Pubmed and Medline were used with the following key words: concussion and, physical activity, neurometabolic, gene regulation, trauma, nervous system, mild head injury, acute exercise, cellular physiology and pathophysiology.",
        "It is our contention that understanding the cellular perspective will help guide clinical management, and promote research into post-concussion exercise."
