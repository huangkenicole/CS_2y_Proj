        "In 1970 the Los Angeles County Occupational Health Service began a program to monitor the health status and to increase the physical fitness of its 1,800 fire fighters. By 1973 physical examinations including resting ECG and blood laboratory studies had been completed for all fire fighters. In addition, the oldest 998 fire fighters were tested for physical work capacity (PWC), job-related strength performance, and spine flexibility. Exercise prescriptions and health enhancement counseling were given by exercise physiologists at the time of testing, and one hour per shift was assigned for the exercise. Data were not kept to determine compliance with the exercise program but physical activity was evaluated by interview and the same physiological measurements were made at each examination. By 1982 departmental averages for PWC had increased 16%, with the oldest age group (older than 50 years) showing the most marked improvement. The percentage of habitual smokers decreased from 44% to 25%. High levels of PWC, strength, and flexibility were found to be inversely related to workers' compensation costs. Fire fighters with below-average PWCs subsequently experienced 2.6 times more myocardial infarctions than their above-average counterparts. While it is difficult to determine the influence of any one factor on the collective wellbeing of the fire fighters, it is logical to assume that this program has had an important beneficial effect on the maintenance of a healthy work force."
