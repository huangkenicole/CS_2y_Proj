        "This study aimed to examine the switch from glargine+once daily insulin aspart (1\u2009+\u20091 regimen) to glargine+insulin aspart 30 before breakfast combined with exercise and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with poorly controlled blood glucose levels.",
        "Consecutive patients with poorly controlled T2DM (n\u2009=\u2009182) were switched from the 1\u2009+\u20091 regimen to glargine+insulin aspart 30 before breakfast in combination with exercise after dinner and dividing meals in two (same final calories intake). The insulin doses were adjusted according to blood glucose levels within 4\u00a0weeks after the switch and maintained for 12\u00a0weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hpostprandial glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), daily insulin dose, and hypoglycemia events were assessed.",
        "Sixteen weeks after the switch, 2\u00a0h PG levels and HbA1c levels (from 8.5 to 7.4%, P\u2009=\u20090.001) were improved. The proportions of patients reaching the HbA1c targets of 7.5% were improved (from 22.5 to 58.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.001). Among the 182 patients, 24 (13.2%) divided one meal into two meals, and 23 (12.6%) divided two meals into four meals. Among all patients, 8.5% had to reuse insulin aspart before dinner after the study. One patient with diarrhea and poor appetite experienced severe hypoglycemia. The rate of hypoglycemia was 3.76 events/patient-year. The daily insulin Aspart 30 dose was higher than the original insulin aspart dose (P\u2009=\u20090.001).",
        "For patients with poorly controlled T2DM under the 1\u2009+\u20091 regimen, switching to glargine+insulin aspart 30 before breakfast combined with exercise after dinner and dividing meals showed promising benefits."
