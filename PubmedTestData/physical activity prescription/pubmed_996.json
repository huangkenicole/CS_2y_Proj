        "Evaluation of the effects of an individualized home-based unsupervised aerobic training on body composition, physical and physiological parameters in female and male obese adults.",
        "Two hundred and twenty obese adults (age 47.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.4\u00a0years; BMI 38.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) entered the 4-month training program. Body composition, physiological and functional capacities were assessed pre- and post-intervention. All subjects were requested to perform unsupervised aerobic training with the intensity based on heart rate, walking speed and OMNI-RPE score corresponding to the individual ventilatory threshold for at least 5\u00a0days/week.",
        "After 4-month study period, 40% of patients completed the protocol, 24% had high compliance (HC) (exercise\u00a0\u2265\u00a03\u00a0days/week), while 16% had low compliance (LC) to exercise prescription (exercise\u00a0<\u00a0than 3\u00a0days/week). In HC group, a significant improvement of body composition variables after training was performed. Moreover, oxygen uptake and metabolic equivalent at peak significantly increased after training. Six-minute walking test (6MWT) distance significantly increased while heart rate during 6MWT was significantly lower after training. No significant differences were found in LC group between pre- and post-intervention in all variables. Interestingly, gender does not influence the effects of training.",
        "Our results indicate that subjects, independent of gender, with high compliance to the aerobic training based on a new individualized method can achieve a significant reduction in weight loss and also an improvement in physical and physiological parameters. This innovative personalized prescription could be a valuable tool for exercise physiologist, endocrinologists, and nutritionists to approach and correct life style of obese subjects."
