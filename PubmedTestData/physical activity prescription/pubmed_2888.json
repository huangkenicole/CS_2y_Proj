        "The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a pulmonary complication of liver disease found in 10 to 32% of patients with cirrhosis and is characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations and abnormal oxygenation. Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for this disease. Patients with HPS have significant exercise limitations, impacting their quality of life and associated with poor liver transplant outcomes. Many patients with HPS exhibit orthodeoxia-an improvement in oxygenation in the supine compared to the upright position. We hypothesize that exercise capacity will be superior in the supine compared to the upright position in such patients.",
        "We propose a randomized controlled crossover trial in patients with moderate HPS (PaO<sub>2</sub> < 80\u2009mmHg) and orthodeoxia (supine to upright PaO<sub>2</sub> decrease >\u20094\u2009mmHg) comparing the effect of supine vs upright position on exercise. Patients with pulmonary hypertension, FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.65, significant coronary artery disease, disorders preventing or contraindicating use of a cycle ergometer, and/or moderate or severe ascites will be excluded. Participants will be randomized to cycle ergometry in either the supine or upright position. After a short washout period (a minimum of 1\u2009day to a maximum of 4\u2009weeks), participants will crossover and perform an exercise in the alternate position. Exercise will be performed at a constant work rate of 70-85% of the predicted peak work rate until the \"stopping time\" is reached, defined by exhaustion, profound desaturation, or safety concerns (drop in systolic blood pressure or life-threatening arrhythmia). The primary outcome will be the difference in the stopping time between exercise positions, compared with a repeated measures analysis of variance method with a mixed effects model approach. The model will be adjusted for period effects. P < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.",
        "HPS patients have hypoxemia leading to significant exercise limitations. If our study is positive, a supine exercise regimen could become a routine prescription for patients with HPS and orthodeoxia, enabling them to exercise more effectively. Future studies could explore the corresponding effects of a supine exercise training regimen on physiologic variables such as long-term exercise capacity, quality of life, dyspnea, and liver transplantation outcomes.",
