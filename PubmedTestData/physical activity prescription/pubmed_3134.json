        "Rehabilitation programs after amputation often include fitting a prosthesis, but prescriptions vary under similar circumstances. The US Medicare Functional Classification Level (K-level) is a scale for describing functional abilities of persons after lower-limb amputation (from 0\u2009=\u2009no ability or potential to ambulate, to 4\u2009=\u2009prosthetic demands of a child/active adult/athlete). Different outcome measures are used to assess K-level, including six-minute walk test (6MWT). We attempted to predict the assigned K-level of unilateral transtibial prosthesis users from their results of 6MWT and one-leg standing test on prosthesis (OLSTP). Outpatients who had been rehabilitated and fitted with transtibial prosthesis at the University Rehabilitation Institute in Ljubljana in 2014 were included in a retrospective audit. The data were analysed using receiver-operating-characteristics curves, linear discriminant analysis, classification trees and ordinal logistic regression. Among the 120 patients (aged 39-90, mean 67\u2009years; 79% men), eight belonged to K1 level, 94 to K2, and 18 to K3 or K4; 61 could not stand on the prosthesis, eight stood on it for 1\u2009s, and 51 stood on it for 2\u2009s or more. With a simple classification rule based only on 6MWT (130\u2009m threshold for K2/K3/K4 vs. K1, 340\u2009m for K3/K4 vs. K1/K2), we observed sensitivity and specificity close to 90%. The more sophisticated statistical approaches yielded substantially similar and comparably accurate results. 6MWT and OLST could therefore be used as predictors for transtibial prosthesis prescription in clinical practice."
