        "Faced with lockdowns, it was mandatory the development of supervised home-based RT protocols to keep patients with chronic kidney disease engaged in programs. Nonetheless, there is a lack of scientific literature regarding its effects on patients.",
        "To investigate the effects of a supervised home-based progressive resistance training program on functional performance, bone mineral density, renal function, endothelial health, inflammation, glycemic homeostasis, metabolism, redox balance, and the modulation of exerkines in patients with CKD in stage 2.",
        "Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a031) were randomized and allocated into the control group (CTL; n\u00a0=\u00a015; 58.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.22\u00a0yrs) or resistance training group (RT; n\u00a0=\u00a016; 57.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.74\u00a0yrs). RT group performed 22\u00a0weeks of supervised progressive home-based resistance exercises. Bone mineral density, anthropometric measurements, and functional performance were assessed. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and after the intervention for the analysis of markers of renal function, endothelial health, inflammation, glycemic homeostasis, metabolism, and redox balance.",
        "Twenty-two weeks of home-based RT were effective in improving (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) functional performance, bone mineral density, uremic profile, ADMA, inflammatory markers, the Klotho-FGF23 axis, glycemic homeostasis markers, and exerkines. These improvements were accompanied by higher concentrations of exerkines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. RT group displayed a decrease in cases of osteopenia after the intervention (RT: 50\u00a0% vs. CTL: 86.7\u00a0%; X<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a04.763; P\u00a0=\u00a00.029).",
        "Results provide new evidence that supervised home-based progressive RT may be a relevant intervention to attenuate the progression of CKD and improve functional capacity, bone mineral density, and the immunometabolic profile. These improvements are associated with positive modulation of several exerkines."
