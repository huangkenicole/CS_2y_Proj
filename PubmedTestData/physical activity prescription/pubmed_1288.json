        "To evaluate the efficacy of prescription-grade Crystalline Glucosamine Sulfate (pCGS) as an add-on treatment to conventional therapy, compared to usual therapy alone, in patients with erosive osteoarthritis of the hand (EHOA).",
        "This 6-month retrospective case-control study included patients with concomitant knee osteoarthritis and symptomatic EHOA. Participants were stratified into two groups based on whether or not pCGS (1500\u00a0mg/day) was added to the conventional therapy (education and training in ergonomic principles, exercise and use on-demand of symptomatic drugs) for hand osteoarthritis. Patients were evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6\u00a0months. Primary outcomes were the change from baseline to month 6 in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) hand pain and in Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score. A set of secondary parameters was also evaluated.",
        "123 patients were included as follows: 67 treated with pCGS in addition to conventional therapy (pCGS Group) and 56 with conventional therapy alone (Control Group). After 6\u00a0months a significant difference in VAS and in FIHOA score (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively) was observed in favor of pCGS Group. Similar results were found for morning stiffness duration (p\u2009<\u20090.05), health assessment questionnaire (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and physical and mental component score of 36-item short form (p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). A significant reduction of symptomatic drug consumption at 3 and 6\u00a0months was reported in the pCGS Group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). No serious adverse event was recorded in both groups.",
        "Despite all the limitations inherent to an observational study, our results suggest the potential effectiveness of pCGS, when used in combination with conventional therapy in EHOA. Further randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm these positive findings.",
