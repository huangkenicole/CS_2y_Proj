        "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a 4-wk individualized training program using Vmax as the exercise intensity and utilizing between 60 and 75% of a subject's Tmax as the exercise duration.",
        "Five male, middle-distance, trained subjects with the following characteristics (mean +/- SD): age, 22.8 +/- 4.5 yr; height, 181 +/- 4.7 cm; weight, 74.1 +/- 3.2 kg; skinfolds based on five areas, 35.9 +/- 3.9; and VO2max, 61.5 +/- 6.1 mL O2 x kg min(-1) volunteered to participate in this study. Before the training program, the subjects completed a 3000-m time trial, and three each of VO2max/Vmax and Tmax tests. Subjects then completed a 4-wk training program on the treadmill and were then retested on the VO2max/Vmax and Tmax tests.",
        "Pretraining versus posttraining results showed significant (P < 0.05) increases in average Vmax (20.5 km x h(-1) vs 21.3 km x h(-1) posttraining), Tmax (225.5 s vs 300.9 s posttraining), and VO2max (61.5 mL O2 x kg x min(-1) vs 64.5 mL O2 x kg x min(-1)). The 3000-m time trial decreased significantly from a pretraining value of 616.6 s to a posttraining value of 599.6 s (P < 0.05).",
        "The results of this study indicate that by utilizing between 60 and 75% of Tmax as an exercise duration and using Vmax as an exercise intensity that these two parameters can be extremely valuable in the prescription of exercise programs for athletes."
