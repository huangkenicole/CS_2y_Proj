        "Background Patients prescribed opioids often have chronic conditions that increase their risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but little is known about the primary preventive cardiovascular care these patients receive. Methods and Results We analyzed data from the 2014 to 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to evaluate physicians' provision of primary preventive cardiovascular care to adults with and without opioid prescriptions. We included all visits made by adults 40 to 79\u00a0years old with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor but no existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. There were \u224832\u00a0million visits by adults who were prescribed opioids and \u2248167\u00a0million visits by adults not prescribed opioids on an annual basis. The prevalence of primary preventive care was modest in patients with versus those without opioid prescriptions, respectively: (1) statins for patients with dyslipidemia (52.1% versus 46.3%); (2) statins for patients with diabetes mellitus (49.1% versus 37.9%); (3) antihypertensive agents for patients with hypertension (76.5% versus 65.8%); (4) diet/exercise counseling (40.5% versus 45.3%); and (5) smoking cessation therapy (25.3% versus 19.3%). In multivariate analyses, opioid use was associated with higher rates of statin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47; <i>P</i>=0.007) and antihypertensive medication in patients with hypertension (aRR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; <i>P</i><0.001). Conclusions Overall adherence to guideline-recommended primary preventive cardiovascular care during ambulatory visits was suboptimal. Findings show that patients prescribed opioids versus those without opioid prescriptions were more likely to receive statin therapy and antihypertensive agents in the setting of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, respectively. Ongoing efforts to bridge these gaps in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease remain a high priority."
