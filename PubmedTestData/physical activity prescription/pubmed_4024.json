      "AbstractText": [
        "Overall, respiratory and peripheral muscular perceptions of exercise have been examined in 16 subjects (eight men and eight women), each performing four types of exercise (two-leg, one-leg, arm + shoulder, and arm ergometry) under both normoxic and hypoxic (12% oxygen) conditions. Subjects could distinguish ratings for the three types of sensation. Both overall and peripheral muscular perceptions associated with a given oxygen intake or power output increased more than respiratory perceptions as the volume of active muscle was decreased. Hypoxia tended to increase both overall and respiratory perceptions for a given absolute oxygen consumption. Cross-modal comparisons suggested an average overall RPE of close to 13 units at 70% of a task and environment-specific peak oxygen intake, irrespective of exercise conditions, but the SD of individual responses varied by at least +/- 2 units about this average. Peripheral muscular sensations dominated small muscle tasks, but the peripheral muscular RPE became relatively consistent when related to external work rate per liter of active muscle. Respiratory perceptions provided some guide to the intensity of physical activity with a given mode of exercise and fixed environmental conditions. However, if respiratory RPE is used to \"fine-tune\" cross-modal exercise prescriptions, account must be taken of the distorting influence of active muscle volume and of hypoxia."
