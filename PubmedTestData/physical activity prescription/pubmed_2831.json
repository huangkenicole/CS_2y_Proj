      "AbstractText": [
        "Opioids are the only class of drug with the proven ability to control severe pain. The introduction of stringent opioid prescribing restrictions has inevitably impacted upon the ability of those prescribing opioids for advanced life-limited disease to practice as previously and could limit the supply of adequate pain relief to patients with cancer. This review considers the evidence that symptom management of patients with advanced cancer contributes to the \"opioid problem\" and whether there is adequate recognition of the risks involved.",
        "The literature suggests that the risk of opioid abuse is low in the palliative care population as is the risk of legal consequences for doctors prescribing opioids at the end of life. However, as many patients with cancer are living longer or surviving with chronic pain, palliative care physicians must be cognisant not only of the risks of long term opioid use but also of the risk of opioid misuse. Adherence to evidence or consensus-based guidelines is necessary to avoid inappropriate prescribing. In palliative care, it is appropriate not only to exercise a reasonable degree of opioid control and surveillance, primarily for the good of society, but also to ensure that the ability to treat pain in patients with advanced malignant disease is not compromised."
