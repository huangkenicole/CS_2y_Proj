      "AbstractText": [
        "This study is a secondary analysis of the trial by Callaghan et al. (2011), which reported higher antidepressant effects for preferred intensity (n\u2009=\u200919) vs. prescribed intensity (n\u2009=\u200919) exercise of three sessions/week over four weeks in depressed women. In particular, the present study sought to examine whether greater clinically significant individual change/recovery was observed in the preferred compared to the prescribed exercise group.",
        "The reliable change index and the C<sub>cutoff</sub> score criteria described by Jacobson and Truax (1991) were employed to determine clinical significance. These criteria examined if individual change in depression scores from pre- to post-intervention in the preferred intensity group were statistically significant beyond the standard error of difference derived from the active comparator prescribed group, and subsequently within a normal population range. Patients fulfilling the first or both criteria were classified as improved or recovered, respectively.",
        "Post-intervention depression scores of six patients in the preferred intensity exercise group (32%) demonstrated statistically reliable improvement (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and recovery. Half of this subgroup started as moderately depressed. No patient demonstrated a reliable deterioration in depression. Due to a small sample size, it was impossible to determine whether patients on psychiatric medication or medication-free patients were equally benefited from preferred intensity exercise. Thirteen patients in the preferred intensity group (68%) displayed non-statistically significant change in post-intervention depression scores (p\u2009>\u20090.05), although eight of them showed a non-significant improvement in post-intervention depression scores and three could not technically show an improvement in depression due to floor effects (baseline depression within normal range).",
        "Preferred intensity exercise of three sessions/week over four weeks led almost a third of the patients to record scores consistent with recovery from depression. Health professionals may consider that short-term preferred intensity exercise provides clinically significant antidepressant effects comparing favourably to exercise on prescription."
