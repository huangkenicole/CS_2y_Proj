      "AbstractText": [
        "Previous studies in primary care settings showed that brief advice prescribing physical activity for inactive patients could be an effective way to promote physical activity. Park prescription interventions confer health benefits associated with exposure to nature and increased physical activity by recommending park use specifically to increase physical activity in parks. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a park prescription intervention for increasing time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) assessed by accelerometry. Middle-aged Singaporeans who were insufficiently active and who met health screening criteria were recruited via existing community health screening programs and allocated to one of two groups. Intervention participants received a prescription of physical activity in parks, an information pack, access to a weekly group exercise program in parks and telephone counselling (<i>n</i> = 80). Control participants received physical activity materials (<i>n</i> = 80). The primary outcome (mean difference between both groups in time spent in MVPA minutes per week measured by accelerometer) will be assessed at six months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported health behaviors, self-reported mental wellbeing and objectively-measured physical health. This is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of a park prescription intervention for increasing health-enhancing MVPA."
