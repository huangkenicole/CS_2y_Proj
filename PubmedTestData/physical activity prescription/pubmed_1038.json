        "Further information is needed on how community exercise facilities can be effectively utilised to engage people living with chronic health conditions in exercise. The aim of this study was to identify the exercise barriers, facilitators and needs of patients with chronic disease in the community; and to provide recommendations to support the transition from hospital-based to community-based exercise. Using a qualitative approach, four focus groups were conducted with patients who had completed hospital-based exercise programmes (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and fitness instructors (n\u00a0=\u00a010). Data were audio recorded, member checked and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis using NVivo. The side effects of chronic health conditions, the gym environment and a need for support when joining/attending a gym were perceived as barriers to exercising in the community. In contrast, the presence of supportive staff was perceived by patients as a facilitator to engaging in exercise in the community. A total of three themes emerged from participants views on exercise needs in the community; the referral and induction process in community gyms, fitness instructor training and experience and creating a supportive exercise environment. Themes informed eight key recommendations to support patients to exercise in the community, including supportive gym referral and induction processes for patients with chronic conditions, increased professional training for fitness instructors in the area of chronic disease management and exercise prescription, and exercise support at regular intervals for those with chronic conditions attending community gyms. This study found that there is potential for community gyms to play a key role in promoting health among people with chronic conditions. However, more can be done to foster an inclusive atmosphere in this space. Patients living with chronic conditions need information and advice on exercising in their communities. Community gyms require further support to ensure that facilities meet the exercise needs of people with chronic conditions."
