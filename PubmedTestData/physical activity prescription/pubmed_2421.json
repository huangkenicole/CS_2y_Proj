      "AbstractText": [
        "An estimated 27.8% of the United States (US) population aged\u00a0\u226520\u00a0years has hyperlipidemia, defined as total serum cholesterol of\u00a0\u2265240\u00a0mg/dL. A previous study of US physician office visits for hyperlipidemia in 2005 found both suboptimal compliance and racial/ethnic disparities in screening and treatment.",
        "The aim was to estimate current rates of laboratory testing, lifestyle education, and pharmacotherapy for hyperlipidemia.",
        "Data were derived from the US National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a nationally representative study of office-based physician visits, for 2013-2014. Patients aged\u00a0\u226520\u00a0years with a primary or secondary diagnosis of hyperlipidemia were sampled. Study outcomes included receipt or ordering of total cholesterol testing, diet/nutrition counseling, exercise counseling, and pharmacotherapy prescription including statins, ezetimibe, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, or combination therapies.",
        "Compared with previously reported results for 2005, rates of pharmacotherapy have remained static (52.2 vs. 54.6% for 2005 and 2013-2014, respectively), while rates of lifestyle education have markedly declined for diet/nutrition (from 39.7 to 22.4%) and exercise (from 32.1 to 16.0%). Lifestyle education did not vary appreciably by race/ethnicity in 2013-2014. However, rates of lipid testing were much higher for whites (41.6%) than for blacks (29.9%) or Hispanics (34.2%). Tobacco education was ordered/provided in only 4.0% of office visits.",
        "Compliance with guidelines for the screening and treatment of hyperlipidemia remains suboptimal, and rates of lifestyle education have declined since 2005. There exists an urgent need for enhanced levels of provider intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with hyperlipidemia."
