        "The overarching problem in the treatment of obesity is the consistency with which weight in treatment is regained. The aim of this study is to follow-up the patient using a multifactor approach (cognitive-behavioral therapies, diet and physical activity counselling, an \"on-off\" prescription of orlistat) during 4 years in order to assess the efficacy of this specific long-term weight loss maintenance programme. Weight maintenance is defined as a weight change of <2.5% of the study entry body weight. Fifty obese patients having previously lost at least 10% of their weight by any weight loss programme before entering the maintenance multifactor approach were enrolled. Ninety percent of the patients maintained more than 10% weight loss after 2 years. All the physical characteristics remained similar between study entry and 2 years after the weight loss maintenance programme. Waist and hip as well as fat mass did not show any significant differences and the mean fat mass remained stable 2 years later. In addition, all the psychological parameters analysed remained stable and in a normal range. In conclusion, this multifactor approach shows promising interim results at year-2. The multifactor approach with an \"on-off\" prescription of orlistat seems to be appropriate for the long term weight loss maintenance. But considering the clinical and psychological diversity of the patients, this approach has to be individually adapted for patients presenting eating behavior disorders which need a particular follow-up."
