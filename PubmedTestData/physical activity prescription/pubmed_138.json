        "To review intervention variables and outcomes of studies designed to increase physical activity or exercise participation among people experiencing first-episode psychosis.",
        "A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 2014.",
        "Eleven eligible studies describing 12 interventions were included (n\u2009=\u2009351; 14-35 years) incorporating health coaching (n\u2009=\u20095), exercise prescriptions based on physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate) (n\u2009=\u20093), supervised, individually tailored programmes (n\u2009=\u20092), an Internet-delivered intervention and a yoga intervention. The majority of the interventions were delivered over 12 weeks (n\u2009=\u20096) and in community settings (n\u2009=\u200911). Five studies assessed aerobic capacity (VO2 max or VO2 peak) and three studies assessed self-reported physical activity levels.",
        "Considerable heterogeneity in the design, implementation and assessment of interventions was found. There is an urgent need to better understand how physical activity can be increased in line with the internationally endorsed HeaL (Healthy\u2005Active\u2005Lives) Declaration 5-year physical activity target."
