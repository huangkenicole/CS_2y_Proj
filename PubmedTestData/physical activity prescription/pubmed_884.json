        "INTRODUCTION Prescribing physical activity is an inexpensive method to promote patients' long-term health, but determinants of adherence with physical activity prescriptions are seldom considered. AIM To identify facilitators and barriers experienced by adults with type 2 diabetes when prescribed regular walking. METHODS Participants were prescribed a regular walking routine that met current physical activity guidelines for type 2 diabetes management for a period of 3 months. Pre- and post-intervention questions considered participants' self-rated health and physical activity amount. Thematic analysis of recorded interviews held after the 3-month prescription identified barriers and facilitators to adherence for participants. RESULTS Twenty-eight adults (aged 60\u00b19 years, body mass index 32.3\u00b14.0kg/m2, HbA1c 59\u00b116mmol/mol) participated in the 3-month intervention, providing 7 years of lived experience. Self-rated health (14%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7-22%) and time spent walking (+11 min/day; 95% CI 4-18 min/day) increased following the prescription. Major themes motivating participants were: establishing a walking routine; the support of their family members; observing health benefits; and being monitored by a health professional. The greatest barriers were associated with walking in the evening and included feelings of insecurity in the dark or a preference for sedentary behaviour. DISCUSSION A prescription to walk increased time spent in physical activity and self-rated health in adults with type 2 diabetes. Health-care professionals can support walking prescriptions by promoting facilitators and reducing barriers to prescription adherence. Practical solutions to barriers include identifying alternative physical activity opportunities within the house or advice to develop support networks to provide company while walking."
