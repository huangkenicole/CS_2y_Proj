      "AbstractText": [
        "The study addresses knowledge gaps in research regarding influences of routine health care delivery of physical activity on prescription (PAP). The aim was to investigate if patient and health care characteristics are associated with increased physical activity 1\u2009year after prescription among patients offered counselor support in addition to health care professionals' prescription. The study was conducted in primary and secondary care in a Swedish health care region.",
        "All PAP recipients during 1\u2009year were invited (N\u2009=\u20091503) to participate in this observational prospective study. Data were collected from medical records and questionnaires (baseline and follow-up). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis were used. The outcome variable was increased physical activity after 1\u2009year. Study variables were patient and health care characteristics.",
        "Three hundred and fifty-five patients with complete follow-up data were included. The mean age was 62\u2009years (SD\u2009=\u200914; range, 18-90) and 68% were females. Almost half (47%) had increased physical activity 1\u2009year after PAP. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased physical activity at follow-up was positively associated with lower baseline activity, counselor use, and positive perception of support. Counselor users with low baseline activity had higher odds ratio for increased physical activity at follow-up than non-users (OR\u2009=\u20097.2, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.2-23.5 vs. OR\u2009=\u20093.2, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.4-7.5). Positive perception of support was associated with increased physical activity among counselor users but not among non-users.",
        "An increase in physical activity after PAP was related to low baseline activity, positive perception of support, and use of counselor support after PAP. Qualified counseling support linked to PAP seems to be important for achieving increased physical activity among patients with lower baseline activity."
