        "To examine how physical exercise can enhance the quality of life (QOL) of people with cancer and to provide general guidelines for incorporating exercise into care plans for these patients.",
        "Published and nonpublished medical, nursing, rehabilitation, and physical exercise literature.",
        "Including physical exercise in the care plans of people with cancer can enhance their QOL. The development of an individualized exercise plan for patients with cancer involves screening, assessment, prescription, goal setting, evaluation, and communication. The success of wellness-oriented interventions, such as exercise, can be evaluated with patient diaries, monitoring, and a QOL measurement tool.",
        "Physical exercise can positively influence all dimensions of life. Nurses must use sound clinical judgment and creativity and collaborate with other healthcare disciplines when prescribing exercise. Established exercise protocols for people with cancer are limited, and further research is needed in this area.",
        "Oncology nurses must continue to expand the literature on guidelines and precautions for exercise in oncology populations. Nurses need to use their knowledge of oncology, QOL, and exercise to recommend and encourage the incorporation of physical exercise into the care plans of people with cancer."
