        "In clinical practice, translating the benefits of a sustained physically active lifestyle on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is difficult. A walking prescription may be an effective alternative.",
        "To examine the effect of a 10 000 steps per day prescription on glycaemic control of patients with T2DM.",
        "Forty-six adults with T2DM attending a general outpatient clinic were randomised into two equal groups. The intervention group was given goals to accumulate 10 000 steps per day for 10 weeks, whereas the control group maintained their normal activity habits.",
        "Daily step count was measured with waist-mounted pedometer and baseline and endline average steps per day. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), anthropometric, and cardiovascular measurements were also obtained. An intention-to-treat analysis was done.",
        "The average baseline step count was 4505 steps per day for all participants, and the average step count in the intervention group for the last 4 weeks of the study period was higher by 2913 steps per day (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1274 to 4551, <i>F</i> (2, 37.7) = 18.90, <i>P</i><0.001). Only 6.1% of the intervention group participants achieved the 10 000 steps per day goal. The mean baseline HbA1c was 6.6% (range = 5.3 to 9.0). Endline HbA1c was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference -0.74%, 95% CI = -1.32 to -0.02, <i>F</i> = 12.92, <i>P</i> = 0.015) after adjusting for baseline HbA1c. There was no change in anthropometric and cardiovascular indices.",
        "Adherence to 10 000 steps per day prescription is low but may still be associated with improved glycaemic control in T2DM. Motivational strategies for better adherence would improve glycaemic control."
