        "Obese adolescents are at higher risk of development of cardiovascular risk factors and obesity in later life. Dietary intake of antioxidants, particularly curcumin, as an active ingredient of turmeric extract, may have noticeable effects on obesity and its important complications such as cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of curcumin supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors among overweight and obese female adolescents.",
        "Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial; Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan, Iran.",
        "60 adolescent girls (aged 13-18 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or intervention. The adolescents were asked to consume one 500 mg tablet per day, containing either standardized 95% turmeric extract or placebo, and to undergo a weight maintenance or a mild weight loss diet for 10 weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical indices were assessed at the baseline and the end of the intervention.",
        "Curcumin supplementation had beneficial effects on body mass index (P = 0.019), waist circumference (P = 0.008), hip circumference (P = 0.030), high-density lipoprotein levels (P = 0.042) and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio (P = 0.021). However, in univariate analysis of covariance, no significant differences were found between the intervention and placebo groups after 10 weeks of supplementation (P > 0.05).",
        "Prescription of curcumin supplementation along with use of a slight weight loss diet might have beneficial effects on some cardiovascular risk factors among overweight and obese female adolescents. Larger clinical trials with higher curcumin doses and longer duration are needed to confirm the results from the current study.",
