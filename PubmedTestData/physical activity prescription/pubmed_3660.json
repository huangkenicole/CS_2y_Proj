        "Foot orthotics are commonly used as an intervention for treating lower extremity musculoskeletal pathology. Qualitative research regarding the benefit of foot orthotics tends to be favorable, while the results of quantitative studies often conflict.",
        "Eight men (mean age = 35.8 +/- 12.7 years) and 5 women (mean age = 30.4 +/- 10.6 years), who demonstrated abnormal pronation, walked quickly (average velocity = 1.9 m/s) on a treadmill with and without foot orthotics. Subjects were filmed using a 2-dimensional video system and plastic molds designed to indicate calcaneal position inside the shoe during static standing and treadmill walking.",
        "Paired t tests indicated that foot orthotics significantly reduced the mean maximum calcaneal eversion angle by 2.2 degrees and the mean calcaneal eversion angle at heel rise by 2.1 degrees during fast walking. Orthotic and nonorthotic conditions did not differ significantly for the remaining kinematic variables. A one-way ANOVA indicated that calcaneal eversion in standing was significantly greater for barefoot standing compared with standing in shoes with or without orthotics. ANOVA also indicated that the plastic molds provided reliable measures of calcaneal position.",
        "Foot orthotics have a significant effect on calcaneal eversion and shoes also should be considered in conjunction with foot orthotic prescription."
