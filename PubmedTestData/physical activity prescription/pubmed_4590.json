        "Mobile health (mHealth) is emerging as the most convenient way to deliver rehabilitation services remotely, and collect outcomes in real time, thus contributing to disease management by transferring care from hospital to home. It facilitates accessibility to healthcare, enhances patients' understanding of their condition, and their willingness to engage in self-management, giving way to high-quality care to the satisfaction of both patients and healthcare professionals.",
        "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using a smartphone app (called Snapcare) on pain and function in patients suffering from chronic low back pain.",
        "Ninety-three patients with chronic low back pain were recruited and randomly allocated to either the Conventional group (n\u2009=\u200948) receiving a written prescription from the Physician, containing a list of prescribed medicines and dosages, and stating the recommended level of physical activity (including home exercises) or the App group (n\u2009=\u200945) receiving Snapcare, in addition to the written prescription. Pain and disability were assessed at baseline and after 12\u00a0weeks of treatment.",
        "Both the groups showed significant improvement in pain and disability (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The App group showed a significantly greater decline in disability (p\u2009<\u20090.001).",
        "Health applications are promising tools for improving outcomes in patients suffering from various chronic conditions. Snapcare facilitated increase in physical activity and brought about clinically meaningful improvements in pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material."
