        "To compare the effects of 12-week training periods (2 d\u00b7wk) involving resistance training only with the effects of 12-week training periods involving combined resistance (once weekly) and endurance (once weekly) training on strength, endurance performance, and quality of life.",
        "Thirty-six patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were randomized to combined training (REG), resistance training alone (RG), or control (CG) groups. Patients were tested for maximal strength of the upper and lower extremities, power output of the lower extremities, maximal (Wmax) and submaximal exercise capacity, performance on a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and quality of life.",
        "REG and RG induced similar maximal strength gains. Muscle power increased 19% (P \u2264 .01) and Wmax improved 13% (P < .05) in REG. Reductions (P < .05) in the heart rate and blood lactate at a given submaximal workload were observed in REG. Improvements in 6MWT and quality of life were similar in both training groups.",
        "Compared with a twice-weekly resistance training program, the combination of once-weekly resistance and once-weekly endurance training not only produced similar gains in maximal strength, 6MWT performance, and quality of life but also produced improvements in muscle power and endurance performance. These findings may have implications for the prescription of resistance and endurance exercise for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
