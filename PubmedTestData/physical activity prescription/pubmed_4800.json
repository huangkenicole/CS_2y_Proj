        "The purpose of this report is to describe how patients with multiple sclerosis increased the isokinetic peak torque of their knee flexors and perceived well-being after an endurance training program.",
        "Five patients trained for 4 to 6 weeks using an endurance program for the lower extremities. Before and after training, the subjects performed 50 repeated maximum knee flexions, with simultaneous recording of surface electromyographic activity of two knee flexors, on 3 separate days using an isokinetic dynamometer. Throughout the tests, the subjects rated their perception of peripheral muscle fatigue. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used to rate different aspects of well-being.",
        "Both the perception of peripheral fatigue and the different VAS ratings had changed positively after training. Three patients achieved higher peak torque levels throughout the posttraining endurance test.",
        "Based on these positive results, the authors conclude that more comprehensive studies of exercise prescription in patients with multiple sclerosis are desirable."
