        "We tested whether a personalized programme based on the energy expenditure obtained from a wristband (WB) and the energy intake obtained from a smartphone application (APP) is superior to a standard approach at promoting weight loss.",
        "We performed a randomized controlled trial in obese children aged 10-17\u2009years. The experimental (EXP) and control (CTR) groups were given a low-energy diet and a prescription for physical activity. The EXP group was equipped with a WB and an APP and given personalized feedback every 7\u2009days. The main outcome was weight loss at 3\u2009months.",
        "The mean (standard deviation) z-score of body mass index at the enrollment was 2.20 (0.47) in the EXP (n\u2009=\u200916 out of 23) and 2.09 (0.34) in the CTR group (n\u2009=\u200914 out of 20) of children who completed the trial. The mean (95%CI) difference in weight loss at 3\u2009months was 0.07\u2009kg (95%CI: 2.81 to 2.96) for EXP vs. the CTR.",
        "A personalized lifestyle programme based on a WB and an APP was not superior to a standard lifestyle programme at promoting weight loss in obese children."
