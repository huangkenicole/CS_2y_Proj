        "Reciprocal walking orthoses are routinely used by thoracic lesion patients for ambulation using crutches. A primary reason for their prescription is to provide therapeutic benefit and improved independence. To achieve this, maximum efficiency of walking and acceptance of the device is necessary to promote long-term compliance. Lateral rigidity in the orthosis influences walking efficiency, but the structural properties of conventional techniques for producing a sufficiently rigid body brace makes them unattractive. Currently patients and clinicians are forced to choose between greater efficiency or cosmesis of the orthosis. Composite materials have the potential to permit the required rigidity in a structure that is less obtrusive. However, their material properties could lead to unsafe forms of failure unless suitable manufacturing methods are devised. It is therefore inappropriate to supply prototypes to patients for field evaluation until laboratory investigation of innovative production methods has ensured that the orthosis is safe. A production technique has been devised that is ostensibly suitable. Prototype body braces have been tested and have been shown to have improved structural properties and safe failure modes. A test programme implemented on a complete concept orthosis has confirmed that improved lateral rigidity can be achieved with a less obtrusive body brace, and that it will behave safely for long enough to permit field evaluation."
