        "Estimation of the intensity of physical activity (PA) based on absolute accelerometer cut points (Cp) likely over- or underestimates intensity for a specific individual. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between absolute moderate intensity Cp and the first ventilatory threshold (VT<sub>1</sub>). A group of 24 pregnant and 15 nonpregnant women who performed a submaximal incremental walking test with measures of ventilatory parameters and accelerations from three different accelerometers on the wrist (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, GENEActiv, Axivity AX3) and one on the hip (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) were analyzed. Cp were determined corresponding to 3 metabolic equivalents of task (MET), using the conventional MET definition (Cp<sub>3.5</sub>) (3.5 mL/kg\u00d7min) and individual resting metabolic rate (Cp<sub>ind</sub>). The ventilatory equivalent (VE/VO<sub>2</sub>) was used to determine VT<sub>1</sub>. Accelerations at VT<sub>1</sub> were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.01) compared to Cp<sub>3.5</sub> and Cp<sub>ind</sub> in both groups. Cp<sub>3.5</sub> and Cp<sub>ind</sub> were significantly different in nonpregnant (<i>p</i> < 0.01) but not in pregnant women. Walking speed at VT<sub>1</sub> (5.7 \u00b1 0.5/6.2 \u00b1 0.8 km/h) was significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in pregnant compared to nonpregnant women and correspondent to 3.8 \u00b1 0.7/4.9 \u00b1 1.4 conventional METs. Intensity at absolute Cp was lower compared to the intensity at VT<sub>1</sub> independent of the device or placement in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Therefore, we recommend individually tailored cut points such as the VT<sub>1</sub> to better assess the effect of the intensity of PA."
