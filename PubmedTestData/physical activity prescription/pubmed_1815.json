        "An individualization of exercise prescription is implemented mainly in terms of intensity but not for duration. To survey the need for an individualized exercise duration prescription, we investigated acute physiologic responses during constant-load exercise of maximal duration (t<sub>max</sub> ) and determined so-called duration thresholds. Differences between absolute (min) and relative terms (% t<sub>max</sub> ) of exercise duration were analyzed. Healthy young and trained male and female participants (n\u00a0=\u00a011) performed an incremental exercise test and one t<sub>max</sub> constant-load exercise test at a target intensity of 10% of maximal power output below the second lactate turn point (LTP<sub>2</sub> ). Blood lactate, heart rate, and spirometric data were measured during all tests. t<sub>max</sub> was markedly different across subjects (69.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.8\u00a0min; range: 40-90\u00a0min). However, distinct duration phases separated by duration thresholds (DTh) were found in most measured variables. These duration thresholds (except DTh1) were significantly related to t<sub>max</sub> (DTh2: r<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.90, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; DTh3: r<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.98, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and showed substantial interindividual differences if expressed in absolute terms (DTh2: 24.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0min; DTh3: 47.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6\u00a0min) but not in relative terms (DTh2: 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7% t<sub>max</sub> ; DTh3: 67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4% t<sub>max</sub> ). Our data showed that (1) maximal duration was individually different despite the same relative intensity, (2) duration thresholds that were related to t<sub>max</sub> could be determined in most measured variables, and (3) duration thresholds were comparable between subjects if expressed in relative terms. We therefore conclude that duration needs to be concerned as an independent variable of exercise prescription."
