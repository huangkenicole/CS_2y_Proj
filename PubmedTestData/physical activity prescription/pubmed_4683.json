        "Tennis is a sport with numerous health benefits for individuals of all ages. It is also a tremendously effective fitness activity. Regular participants experience a wide variety of health-related physical and mental benefits, from improved cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone health to improved agility, coordination, and even stress and anxiety management. Physicians and other health care professionals can play an important role in educating patients and the public about the health benefits of tennis as well as motivating them to take up this activity as part of an overall exercise prescription. Based on the scientific evidence available, it is difficult to find an activity that offers as wide a range of overall health benefits as tennis, and individuals who take up tennis reap tremendous rewards."
