        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sprint training on the anaerobic performance characteristics in well-trained sprint runners employing the maximal anaerobic running test (MART). Another purpose was to study the applicability of MART in the prescription of sprint training. Nine male sprint runners performed the MART before and after a 10-week intensive training period. The MART consisted of n.20-s runs on a treadmill with a 100-s recovery between the runs. Initial power, expressed as O2 demand (74 ml.kg-1.min-1), was increased by 6 ml.kg-1.min-1 for each consecutive run until exhaustion. Blood lactate concentration was measured at rest and after each run. Maximal power (Pmax), power at 10 mM (P10mM) and 3 mM (P3mM) blood lactate levels, and peak blood lactate concentration (peak BLa) were determined from the blood lactate vs O2 demand curve. The Pmax increased from 118.6 +/- 6.0 to 122.6 +/- 4.9 ml kg-1.min-1 (P = 0.009) during the training period and the changes of Pmax correlated positively with the volume of bounding exercises (r = 0.64; p = 0.032). The volume of extensive interval training correlated positively with the changes of P3mM (r = 0.62; p = 0.040) and negatively with the changes of P[10mM-3mM] (r = -0.68; p = 0.016) and peak BLa (r = -0.69; p = 0.019) during the particular training period. A positive correlation was also found between the changes of CMJrest and the volume of bounding and strength training (r = 0.60; p = 0.044). The present results suggested that sprint training induces an adaptive increase in the maximal anaerobic running power in well-trained male sprint runners. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that individual changes in P3mM, peak BLa, Pmax and CMJrest were related to the volume of specific training methods. Therefore we could conclude that the results of the MART could provide guidance in prescribing training for sprint running."
