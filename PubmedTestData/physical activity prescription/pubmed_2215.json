        "Arts on prescription (AoP) interventions are part of mainstream social prescribing provision in primary health care. Whilst the body of evidence for AoP interventions has been developing, this has primarily focused on well-being.",
        "The present work is an observational longitudinal study on a community-based AoP social prescribing intervention in the South West UK.",
        "The present study assessed changes in anxiety, depression, and well-being in a cohort of patients participating in up to two eight-week cycles of AoP. The sample consisted of 245 individuals referred into the programme from 2017 to 2019, with a sub-sample of participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0110) with identifiable multimorbidity. Outcomes were measured pre- and post-intervention at both initial and re-referral.",
        "Anxiety, depression, and well-being were all significantly improved after initial referral, re-referral, and overall from initial to post re-referral for this intervention in the whole sample and multimorbid sub-sample. Multivariate analyses revealed that no participant variables appeared to account for the variance in outcome change scores.",
        "The research provides further support for AoP interventions, finding associations with reduced anxiety and depression and increased well-being. Additionally, these outcomes are evidenced in those with multimorbidity, as well as across initial- and re-referral cycles."
