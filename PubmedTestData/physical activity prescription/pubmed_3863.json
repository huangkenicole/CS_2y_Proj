        "Home-based exercise interventions offer many health benefits; however, the environments that constitute home-based exercise are not well-understood. The purpose of this study was to explore what constitutes the \"home\" for cancer survivors engaging in home-based exercise and identify factors of the environment that may impact exercise participation.",
        "We conducted a qualitative exploratory study of cancer survivors receiving a home-based exercise prescription to manage their cancer-related impairments. Semi-structured interviews included photo elicitation to actively involve participants in the interview process and provide opportunities to visually \"observe\" environments utilized for home-based exercise.",
        "Sixteen participants were interviewed (n = 11 women, median age = 53.5, range = 26-74 years) and three themes emerged: (1) reasons for participating in a home-based exercise program; (2) physical environmental influences and preferences; and (3) social environmental influences and preferences. The ability to self-manage exercise and accommodate competing demands, having access to exercise facilities, feeling comfortable exercising without qualified supervision, and a desire for autonomy were reasons home-based exercise programs were preferred. Participants reported that the physical environment influenced their experience with home-based exercise and sub-themes related to a dynamic environment, indoor and outdoor characteristics, and aesthetics were identified. The social environment, with sub-themes associated with the presence of people, social climate, exercise modeling, connection, and exercise support, also related to exercise behavior.",
        "The findings highlight the influence of the physical and social environment on exercise prescription engagement. They further indicate the need for exercise professionals to consider the environment for exercise when delivering home-based exercise interventions."
