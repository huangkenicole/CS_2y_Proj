        "Challenges with self-management are a major contributor to poor outcomes among adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The causes of poor self-management in COPD are manifold, and they arise from physical, cognitive, socioeconomic, environmental and societal sources. To address this complexity, we developed the Supporting self-Management Behaviors in Adults with COPD (SaMBA-COPD) model, which uses lay health coaches to identify a patient's barriers to effective COPD self-management and provide tailored support to help them overcome those barriers, reduce their symptoms and need for urgent care and improve their quality of life. The 6-month intervention includes referral of patients to a pharmacist for prescription of antibiotic and oral steroid \"rescue packs\" and support for a structured home exercise routine. All interactions of coaches and patients will take place by telephone or video call. We will test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of SaMBA-COPD in a trial of 58 patients randomized 1:1 to the intervention or a COPD education control. Outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 9\u00a0months. Data from the trial will be used to inform the design of a fully powered, multi-site randomized trial of the intervention."
