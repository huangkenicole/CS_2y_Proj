        "The aim of this review is to present the main pieces of evidence, recent literature and to present future perspectives on the use of exercise/physical training in the treatment and improvement of the quality of life of patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.",
        "In the last decades, knowledge about the relevance of physical exercise training in preventing and treating chronic diseases and improving quality of life has grown. Following the global trend exemplified by the expression 'exercise is medicine', the importance of exercise/physical training has also grown in myopathies. However, the science of exercise has a lot to collaborate on and improve patients' quality of life with myopathies by appropriating new technological tools, including accessible and low-cost devices and smartphone apps.",
        "Physical exercise, as already consolidated in the literature, is an effective, well tolerated, and low-cost strategy for patients with myopathies. The use of wearable devices, smartphone apps, and online training prescriptions must accompany the global scenario, bringing new research fields and expanding the options for access to training for the individualized basis, and prescribed by qualified professionals."
