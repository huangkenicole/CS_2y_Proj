      "AbstractText": [
        "Exercise training is\u00a0an effective and safe\u00a0way to counteract cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). High-intensity interval training has proven beneficial for the health of clinical populations. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effects of resistance and high-intensity interval training (RT-HIIT), and moderate-intensity aerobic and high-intensity interval training (AT-HIIT) to usual care (UC) in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was CRF and the secondary endpoints were HRQoL and cancer treatment-related symptoms.",
        "Two hundred and forty women planned to undergo chemotherapy were randomized to supervised RT-HIIT, AT-HIIT, or UC. Measurements were performed at baseline and at 16\u00a0weeks. Questionnaires included Piper Fatigue Scale, EORTC-QLQ-C30, and Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale.",
        "The RT-HIIT group was superior to UC for CRF: total CRF (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), behavior/daily life (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and sensory/physical (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) CRF. Role functioning significantly improved while cognitive functioning was unchanged for RT-HIIT compared to declines shown in the UC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). AT-HIIT significantly improved emotional functioning versus UC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and was superior to UC for pain symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). RT-HIIT reported a reduced symptom burden, while AT-HIIT remained stable compared to deteriorations shown by UC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Only RT-HIIT was superior to UC for total symptoms (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).",
        "16\u00a0weeks of resistance and HIIT was effective in preventing increases in CRF and in reducing symptom burden for patients during chemotherapy for breast cancer. These findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting the inclusion of structured exercise prescriptions, including HIIT, as a vital component of cancer rehabilitation.",
