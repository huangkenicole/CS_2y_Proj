        "As rehabilitation for post-stroke hemiplegic patients has become widely accepted practice, there has been an increase in patients who are more difficult to treat. In the prescription rationale of orthoses for hemiplegics, the knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) for the lower limb has generally been underestimated because of its inhibitory effect on the normal walking pattern and also its interference with gait training. The authors had an experience of 28 hemiplegics with severe physical impairments who were fitted with a convertible plastic KAFO. Among these patients, there were 11 cases in which the KAFO was replaced by an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) within 1.5 to 8 months (average 4 months) following initial prescription when they were able to control their knee actively. Ambulatory capability in these patients was superior to that of the remaining KAFO group. The Barthel index of the AFO group patients was higher than the KAFO group (p < 0.01). However neither age, sex, severity of hemiplegia, starting time of rehabilitation following onset of stroke, time of fitting with the orthosis, nor the functional recovery stage were critical factors between the two groups, only the incidence of major complications affected ambulatory capability."
