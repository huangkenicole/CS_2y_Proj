        "It was previously thought that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. This was also extrapolated to the general population. Thereby, exercise was restrained in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, recent studies have shown that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not the main cause of sudden cardiac death, and moderate exercise is not only safe but beneficial for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With the accumulation of evidence, relevant guidelines recommend low-intensity exercise from the beginning, then gradually recommend moderate-high intensity exercise for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This suggests that we should rediscover the value of exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is now widely accepted that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can benefit from the positive effects of exercise through an individualized exercise prescription based on a comprehensive assessment. This review summarizes the evidence showing patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can exercise safely, and the methods to formulate related exercise prescriptions."
