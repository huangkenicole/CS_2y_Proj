        "Some characteristics of quality and way of life were examined in the group of persons aged over 60 years. One group was in the West region of the Czech Republic--1028 people living in the city of Plzen. The other group was in the East region of Slovakia--125 senior citizens from the town of Presov. The investigations were carried out in general practitioners' offices in 2005/2006. The groups consisted of patients visiting GPs. The reason of their visits was usually a general check of their health state and prescription of medications. An anonymous questionnaire was used. Students of medicine asked the respondents. They tried to find out some characteristics of seniors* life style and other aspects of seniors' life determining the quality of life. Diet, free time activities, physical activity, way of life, including smoking and alcohol consumption were investigated. Some questions were aimed on the respondents opinion about their way of life, their worries and wishes (Tab. 11, Ref. 10). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk."
