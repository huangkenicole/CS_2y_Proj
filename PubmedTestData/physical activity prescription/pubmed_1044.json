        "Research has demonstrated that both exercise, and a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e., high blood sugar, blood lipids, and blood pressure), following a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are beneficial for reducing risk of recurrent stroke or TIA and for improving overall quality of life. Despite this evidence, many stroke and TIA survivors remain inactive and sedentary and present with multiple CVD risk factors. The purpose of this commentary is to highlight gaps in the current literature in regard to exercise and behavior interventions for the stroke and TIA populations, present ideas for intervention design, and discuss the dissemination and implementation of research findings. The future research ideas presented in this commentary are based on current research findings, as well as the professional experience of the article authors. Professional experience spans occupational therapy in neurorehabilitation, clinical exercise physiology in rehabilitation, creation and implementation of stroke rehabilitation clinics, stroke and TIA research, and behavioral and implementation science."
