        "To retrospectively identify factors influencing long-term compliance to home-based resistance training (RT) in a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme.",
        "Five hundred and eighteen patients (447 males, 71 females) attending a CR programme consisting of aerobic exercise, education and lifestyle counselling were also offered RT exercises, which they performed over a 72-month period. These patients were sent a questionnaire to examine ongoing participation in RT and perceptions around RT.",
        "Sixty-nine percent of the surveys were returned. The mean follow-up time was 38.7+/-25.9 months post-RT prescription (about 2.5 years postgraduation from on-site CR). Among respondents, 50% (50.6% males, 42.9% females) were continuing RT at the time of the survey (compliers), and 50% (49.4% males, 57.1% females) had discontinued RT (dropouts). Compliers perceived greater support for RT participation than dropouts (41.3 and 22.5% perceived strong support, respectively, from family/friends and physicians, P<0.005). Dropouts had a higher percentage of body fat at baseline than compliers (32% of dropouts and 20% of compliers had a body fat >25%, P<0.025). Men participated mainly to 'improve appearance' and women to 'prevent osteoporosis'. Weight reduction was a greater motivator to participate for dropouts than for compliers. The main reason for discontinuing RT was 'lack of motivation'. The most common injuries occurred in one shoulder or the lower back. Only 3% discontinued RT because of injury.",
        "One-half of patients starting an RT home-based programme were still under training at the time of the survey (mean 38.7 months). A lower percentage of body fat and support from family/friends and physicians seem to increase long-term compliance. There were sex differences in reasons for participation and dropout. Emphasizing achievable benefits that motivate men and women to participate may help to reduce dropout."
