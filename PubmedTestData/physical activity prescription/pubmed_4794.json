        "Health care utilization variables present during the full 12 months before surgery, which included physical therapy services and visits for exercise therapy or manual therapy procedures and opioid prescriptions.",
        "The mean age of participants was 44.8\u00b111.7 years and 32.4% were female. In the year before surgery, 143 (34.8%) patients had a physical therapy plan of care, 140 (34.1%) had at least 1 visit that included exercise therapy, and only 60 (14.6%) had a minimum of 6 exercise therapy visits. However, 347 (84.4%) patients received at least 1 opioid prescription fill (mean of 6.1 unique fills).",
        "Before elective lumbar spine surgery, opioid prescriptions were common but physical therapy services and exercise therapy utilization occurred infrequently."
