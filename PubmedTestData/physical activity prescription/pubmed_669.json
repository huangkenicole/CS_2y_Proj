        "This French study aimed to evaluate oncologists' and patients' perception of physical activity, particularly adapted physical activity, in order to identify the obstacles and levers to its practice in patients with metastatic cancer.",
        "Between October 2019 and March 2020, 60 medical oncologists and 305 patients with metastatic cancer were asked to fill in a self-completed questionnaire.",
        "The benefits of physical activity are recognised by most oncologists and patients. These benefits were perceived more by oncologists in prevention (78%) or in the early stage (72%) of the disease than in the metastatic stage (55%) (P=0.01). Patient's physical condition (45%) and age (37%) but also the lack of time during the consultation to explain supportive care (35%) are the main obstacles identified by the oncologist to the integration of physical activity into patient care. Furthermore, lack of knowledge of adapted programmes is the main reason given by the physicians who have never prescribed physical activity (51%). On the patient side, while 88% of them had heard of the benefits of physical activity, only 11% had received a prescription. Most oncologists and patients were very interested in receiving information on where and what types of activities to practice, as well as what to avoid.",
        "Efforts in terms of information for both oncologists and patients seem necessary to increase the level of physical activity prescription and practice for patients followed for metastatic cancer."
