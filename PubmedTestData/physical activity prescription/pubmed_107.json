        "International guidelines recommend exercise for all people with cancer. Effective supportive care interventions are required for people diagnosed with lung cancer to reduce morbidity associated with the disease process, frequently occurring comorbidities and\u00a0treatment-related side effects.",
        "This article summarises the evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness and patient experiences of exercise and physical activity interventions for people with lung cancer.",
        "Exercise interventions for people with lung cancer are safe and effective at improving physical fitness, muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes including cancer-related fatigue, dyspnoea and health-related quality of life. Increasing evidence supports the use\u00a0of exercise prior to treatment (prehabilitation) to improve outcomes following surgery. Individuals with lung cancer should be encouraged to be as physically active as possible. Throughout the patient's cancer journey, consideration and prescription of individualised exercise is an important component of care. General practitioners are well placed to coordinate this care, often in conjunction with exercise physiologists or\u00a0physiotherapists."
