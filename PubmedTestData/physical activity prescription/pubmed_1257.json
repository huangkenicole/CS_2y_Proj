        "Exercise has been recommended for blood pressure (BP) control, but not every individual can improve BP and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease effectively by exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the BP response after 12-week exercise intervention and then identify the potential factors of responders on BP (R-BP) control. This was a retrospective cohort study from a project of Taipei City Government. Subjects completed the original program were included for further analysis. Sociodemographic factors, health-related behaviors, and cardiovascular risks were extracted as potential factors. The results were categorized into R-BP control, i.e., BP under optimal level (systolic BP (SBP) < 140 mmHg; and diastolic BP (DBP) < 90 mmHg) or a significant BP reduction (SBP \u219310 mmHg or DBP \u21935 mmHg) after intervention, or non-responder on BP control, i.e., subjects who failed to achieve the targets. There were 81.62% R-BP subjects. R-BP showed lower SBP and lower risk of hypertension at baseline. Active lifestyle could quadruple the number of R-BP. Higher educational level or more prescription medications were likely to be R-BP in subjects with diagnosed hypertension. Active lifestyle combined with exercise could benefit R-BP in the elderly population. Health-related factors also need to be considered for BP control."
