      "AbstractText": [
        "Wearable devices are increasingly popular in clinical and non-clinical populations as a tool for exercise prescription, monitoring of daily physical activity and nutrition, and health-related parameters management. In this regard, smart devices not only assist people in pursuing a healthier lifestyle, but also provide a constant stream of physiological and metabolic data for management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Although the benefits of lifestyle-based interventions (exercise and nutrition) for NCDs are well known, the potential of wearable devices to promote healthy behaviors in clinical populations is still controversial. In this narrative review, we aimed to discuss the current application of wearable devices in NCDs, highlighting their role in prescribing and monitoring daily physical activity and dietary habits in the population living with chronic diseases. None of the studies considered specifically addressed the efficacy of the use of wearable devices, and limited are those that incorporate monitoring of both physical activity and nutrition for NCDs. However, there is evidence that such devices have helped improve physical activity levels, physical fitness, body composition, and metabolic and psychological parameters. Therefore, the authors believe that the benefits obtained from the use of wearable devices are likely to translate to public health and represent one of the important tools for the development of prevention plans in everyday life and clinical practice for optimal patient management."
