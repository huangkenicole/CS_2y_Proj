        "Physical activity is a non-pharmacological treatment validated by the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 since 2011. Since March 2017, a new French law recalls that generalist physicians can prescribe physical activity to their patients suffering from a long-term financial exonerating condition. This physical activity will be adapted to the individual physical capacities and medical risk of the patient. After assessing his/her functional abilities, the attending physician will send the patient, with his or her agreement, to a supervisory structure employing specifically trained professional for physical activity. It should be noted that neither the prescription nor the dispensation of adapted physical activity are covered by health insurance. The introduction of training in the prescription of physical activity in the framework of medical studies will be indispensable for the success of this law."
