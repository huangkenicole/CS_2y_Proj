        "Social prescribing allows health professionals to refer at risk patients toward health and wellbeing interventions and activities in the local community. It is a key part of NHS (National Health Service) England health care policy, and schemes based on the social prescribing model have been developed in countries including Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Singapore. In this chapter, we consider the role that social prescribing can play in reducing stress related problems and supporting and encouraging self-care and self-management of conditions for which conventional medicine may not be the only or the best option. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, we examine the scope of social prescribing and professional and service users' perspectives concerning its strengths and limitations. Our findings suggest that link worker meetings within social prescribing schemes can motivate people to pursue activities with mental, physical and social benefits such as exercise, artistic pursuits and gardening. Problems within schemes included health provider engagement, recruiting those with low agency and communication between professionals and patients about social prescribing. Based on our findings, we propose a number of recommendations for enhancing social prescribing schemes. Professionals, including neurologists, we argue, can benefit from engaging in the concept and practice of social prescribing and referring patients and clients to social prescribing link workers where appropriate. Neurologists are also part of a larger team, as they work alongside allied health professionals such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists, some of whom are already performing aspects of the link worker role."
