        "Risk stratification is required to set an exercise prescription for cardiac rehabilitation, but an optimal scheme for congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. We piloted a system based on hemodynamic rather than anatomic factors: function, oxygen level, rhythm, complex/coronary anatomy, and elevated load (FORCE). Feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the FORCE tool were evaluated. Patients\u2009<\u200922\u00a0years old participating in the Cardiac Fitness Program at Boston Children's Hospital between 02/2017 and 12/2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Assigned FORCE levels, anatomy, adverse events, fitness and exercise test data were collected. Of 63 attempts at FORCE classification, 62 (98%) were successfully classified while one with restrictive cardiomyopathy was not. Thirty-nine (62%) were FORCE 1, 16 (25%) were FORCE 2, and seven (11%) were FORCE 3. Almost half of FORCE 1 patients had simple or complex CHD and the majority of FORCE 2 patients had single ventricle CHD. FORCE 3 patients were more likely to have serious arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy than those in FORCE 1 or 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome patients appeared in FORCE 1 only. No adverse events occurred over 958 total sessions. The total number of fitness sessions/participant was similar across FORCE levels. It was feasible to risk stratify patients with CHD using a clinical FORCE tool. The tool was effective in categorizing patients and simple to use. No adverse events occurred with fitness training over nearly 1000 exercise training sessions. Adding diastolic dysfunction to the original model may add utility."
