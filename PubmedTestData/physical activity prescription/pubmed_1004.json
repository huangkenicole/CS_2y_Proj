        "Physical activity is an important part of human lifestyle although a large percentage of the population remains sedentary. Exercise represents a stress paradigm in which many regulatory endocrine systems are involved to achieve homeostasis. These endocrine adaptive responses may be either beneficial or harmful in case they exceed a certain threshold. The aim of this review is to examine the adaptive endocrine responses of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), catecholamines, cytokines, growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) to a single bout or regular exercise of three distinct types of exercise, namely endurance, high-intensity interval (HIIE) and resistance exercise. In summary, a single bout of endurance exercise induces cortisol increase, while regular endurance exercise-induced activation of the HPA axis results to relatively increased basal cortisolemia; single bout or regular exercise induce similar GH peak responses; regular HIIE training lowers basal cortisol concentrations, while catecholamine response is reduced in regular HIIE compared with a single bout of HIIE. HPA axis response to resistance exercise depends on the intensity and volume of the exercise. A single bout of resistance exercise is characterized by mild HPA axis stimulation while regular resistance training in elderly results in attenuated inflammatory response and decreased resting cytokine concentrations. In conclusion, it is important to consider which type of exercise and what threshold is suitable for different target groups of exercising people. This approach intends to suggest types of exercise appropriate for different target groups in health and disease and subsequently to introduce them as medical prescription models."
