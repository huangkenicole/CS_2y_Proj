        "This study profiled the 24h neuromuscular, endocrine and mood responses to a single versus a double training day in soccer players.",
        "Repeated measures.",
        "Twelve semi-professional soccer players performed small-sided-games (SSG's; 4 vs 4+goalkeepers; 6\u00d77-min, 2-min inter-set recovery) with neuromuscular (peak-power output, PPO; jump height, JH), endocrine (salivary testosterone, cortisol), and mood measures collected before (pre) and after (0h, +24h). The following week, the same SSG protocol was performed with an additional lower body strength training session (back-squat, Romanian deadlift, barbell hip thrust; 4\u00d74 repetitions, 4-min inter-set recovery; 85% 1 rep-max) added at 2h after the SSG's.",
        "Between-trial comparisons revealed possible to likely small impairments in PPO (2.5\u00b12.2Wkg<sup>-1</sup>; 90% Confidence Limits: \u00b12.2Wkg<sup>-1</sup>), JH (-1.3; \u00b12.0cm) and mood (4.6; \u00b16.1AU) in response to the double versus single sessions at +24h. Likely to very likely small favourable responses occurred following the single session for testosterone (-15.2; \u00b16.1pgml<sup>-1</sup>), cortisol (0.072; \u00b10.034ugdl<sup>-1</sup>) and testosterone/cortisol ratio (-96.6; \u00b136.7AU) at +24h compared to the double session trial.",
        "These data highlight that performance of two training sessions within a day resulted in possible to very likely small impairments of neuromuscular performance, mood score and endocrine markers at +24h relative to a single training session day. A strategy of alternating high intensity explosive training days containing multiple sessions with days emphasising submaximal technical/tactical activities may be beneficial for those responsible for the design and delivery of soccer training programs."
