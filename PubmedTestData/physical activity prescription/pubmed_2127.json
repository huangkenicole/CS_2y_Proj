        "Type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, lowering the quality of life and increasing mortality rates of affected individuals. Circulating monocytes are tightly involved in the atherosclerosis process leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their inflammatory profile can be modified by exercise. The objective was to exploratory identify genes associated with CVD that could be regulated by high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in monocytes of type 2 diabetes patients.",
        "Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses were conducted on isolated circulating monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>) of six women aged 60 and over with type 2 diabetes who completed a 12-week supervised HIIT intervention on a treadmill.",
        "Following the intervention, a reduction of resting diastolic blood pressure was observed. Concomitant with this result, 56 genes were found to be downregulated following HIIT intervention in isolated monocytes. A large proportion of the regulated genes was involved in cellular adhesion, migration and differentiation into an \"atherosclerosis-specific\" macrophage phenotype.",
        "The downregulation of transcripts in monocytes globally suggests a favorable cardiovascular effect of the HIIT in older women with type 2 diabetes. In the context of precision medicine and personalized exercise prescription, shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying HIIT effects on the gene profile of immune cells is essential to develop efficient nonpharmacological strategies to prevent CVD in high-risk population."
