      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of the study was to investigate the efficiency, the feasibility, and the safety of a hybrid cardiovascular rehabilitation program in low-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Sixty low-risk patients with stable clinical status who experienced an ACS in the previous 3 months were included in a 3-week rehabilitation program. The patients were randomized either to a group performing the rehabilitation totally in a rehabilitation centre or partially (only the first 5 days) and then in sport centres equipped for supervised adapted physical activities. The sport centres were located in the vicinity of the patient\u2019s home. Both rehabilitation programs entailed endurance and resistance training and educational therapy. Before and after rehabilitation, cardiorespiratory functions were measured. Similar and significant improvements in peak V.O2 and power output were seen in patients after both types of rehabilitation (p < 0.05). No particular complications were associated with both of our programs. We conclude that a hybrid rehabilitation program in low-risk ACS patients is feasible, safe, and as beneficial as a traditional program organised in a rehabilitation centre, at least in a short-term. A longitudinal follow-up should nevertheless be organised to examine the long-term impacts of this hybrid rehabilitation program."
