        "Low cardio-respiratory fitness is prevalent in type 2 diabetics. The objectives of the present study was to assess the effect of an exercise on VO2max and HbA1c in type 2 diabetic patient. The baseline VO2max and HbA1c of 30 diabetics were estimated. VO2max was estimated using the Bruce protocol. HbA1c was measured by ion-exchange chromatography with Bio-Rad D10. After an exercise regimen for a period of 6 months, they returned to check their VO2max and HbA1c. The baseline VO2max was 32.67\u00b111.99 ml/kg/min (low for given age) and HbA1C% values were high (7.58\u00b11.66). After walking it was found that VO2max increased and HbA1c decreased significantly. Exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness and lower HbA1c. So, a suitable exercise should be incorporated along with diet and drug prescription."
