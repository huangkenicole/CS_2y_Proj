        "To investigate prescribed drug utilization in a middle-aged female population and factors possibly related to drug consumption in this population. A random sample of 4200 women aged 35-65 years, drawn from the population register of seven countries in mid-Sweden, received a postal questionnaire. Two thousand nine hundred ninety one (2991) (71.2%) women responded. Forty percent (40%) of the women were currently using drugs and 12% of the users were taking four drugs or more. Polypharmacy increased by age. A large number of factors were correlated with current drug use. In multivariate analyses age, perceived health, body mass index, and educational level remained significantly related to drug use, while factors such as menopausal state, smoking habits, employment status, marital status, and physical activity lost their significance. Current drug use among women increased by age, bad perceived health status, obesity, and college or university education."
