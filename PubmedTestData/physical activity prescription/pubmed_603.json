        "Patients with severe mental disorders suffer from higher rates of poor somatic health and have shorter life expectancy than the average population. Physical activity can treat and prevent several diseases, e.g. cardiovascular and metabolic disorders as well as psychiatric symptoms. It is therefore of utmost importance to develop effective methods to integrate physical activity into psychiatric care. To meet this need, the physical activity intervention Braining was developed. This study aims to describe Braining, to assess the number of patients reached during the first years of pilot testing, to analyze clinical data in the group of patients participating in Braining 2017-2020 and to assess the intervention.",
        "In this descriptive retrospective study we analyzed data from all patients participating in Braining training sessions\u2009\u2265\u20093 times (n\u2009=\u2009239), the Braining Participants. Regular patients at the clinic served as a comparison. Furthermore, medical records were studied for a smaller cohort (n\u2009=\u200951), the Braining Pilot Cohort. Data was analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher's tests.",
        "During the introduction period of Braining, 580 patients attended an information meeting about Braining, or at least one training session. 239 patients participated in\u2009\u2265\u20093 training sessions, considered to be participants of Braining. These Braining Participants (n\u2009=\u2009239), ages 19 to 82, males 23.4%, attended between 3 and 308 training sessions (median 9). The main diagnoses were affective and anxiety disorders. Number of diagnoses ranged from 0 to 10 (median\u2009=\u20092). For the subsample, the Braining Pilot Cohort (n\u2009=\u200951), participants attended between 3 and 208 training sessions (median\u2009=\u200920). Twelve percent were working full-time, and symptom severity of depression and general anxiety was moderate. Two thirds had\u2009\u2265\u20093 different classes of medication. Regarding metabolic morbidity, 28 had been diagnosed with hypertension, though blood lipids, blood glucose as well as blood pressure were within the normal range. Thirty-seven percent were prescribed Physical Activity on Prescription during 2017-2020. One severe adverse event was reported.",
        "The Braining intervention reached all age-groups and patients with a wide and representative diagnostic panorama, suggesting that Braining could be a promising and safe method for implementing physical activity in a psychiatric patient population."
