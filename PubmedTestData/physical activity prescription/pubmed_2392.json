        "We conducted a series of studies aimed at investigating the effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology. On the basis of these and other existing studies, it is possible to draw the following conclusions and to make the following tentative recommendations for patients engaged in exercise training who receive beta-blocker therapy: i) CAD patients treated with beta-blockers are capable of deriving the expected enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness during training, irrespective of the type of drug used; ii) beta1-selective blockers are preferable to nonselective agents for hypertensive patients engaged in exercise training; iii) because beta1-selective blockers impair exercise tolerance in some hypertensive patients, physicians should look out for this adverse reaction and, if present, consider alternative antihypertensive therapy; iv) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity confers no advantage during exercise training; v) exercise intensity prescription for patients receiving beta-blockers should be in accordance with traditional guidelines and based on results of individualized exercise testing performed on medication; vi) exercise training is desirable during beta-blocker therapy in that it appears to offset adverse alterations in lipoprotein metabolism; and vii) nonselective beta-blockers may increase predisposition to exertional hyperthermia, and patients must therefore be encouraged to adhere strictly to accepted guidelines for heat injury prevention."
