        "Individuals with congenital heart defects are at increased risk for developing further cardiovascular complications, which can be mitigated by increasing physical activity. Given that positive health behaviors begin declining during older adolescence, it is vital to promote lifestyle changes in this population.",
        "The current study aims to (a) determine the feasibility/acceptability of the Congenital Heart Disease Physical Activity Lifestyle (CHD-PAL) intervention among adolescents (ages 15-18) with moderate and complex congenital heart defects, and (b) estimate the preliminary efficacy of CHD-PAL for increasing time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiorespiratory fitness and decreasing sedentary behavior.",
        "Eligible participants were randomized into either CHD-PAL (eight 30-min videoconferencing sessions over 20 weeks with an interventionist + Fitbit + exercise prescription) or a comparator (Fitbit + exercise prescription).",
        "Sixty adolescents were randomized (76% recruitment rate; 94% of participants were retained from baseline to follow-up). Most adolescents (73%) and their parents/guardians (76%) reported that the trial was enjoyable. While there was no effect of arm on change in MVPA, sedentary behavior, or cardiorespiratory fitness for the entire sample, among those who engaged in <21 min of MVPA on average at baseline, adolescents in the CHD-PAL intervention had an increase of 16 min/day of MVPA more than comparators (d = 0.90).",
        "The CHD-PAL intervention warrants examination in a larger trial to establish efficacy among those adolescents with a congenital heart defect who engage in <21 min of MVPA/day and should include follow-up assessments to examine effect durability.",
        "NCT03335475."
