        "An accurate exercise prescription for ratings of perceived exertion has previously depended on data from a maximal graded exercise test during which RPE was measured. In many clinical settings RPE is not measured; in many fitness settings maximal testing is not feasible. A new method using treadmill speed or power output of a cycle ergometer at an RPE of 13 from a submaximal test which can be used in these situations is described. We evaluated the accuracy of this method at 50%, 60%, 70%, and 85% VO2max. A total of 160 target RPEs were developed using traditional procedures and the new method. No significant differences between RPEs obtained with the two techniques were found. The mean difference was less than one unit of RPE. It appears that the new method is valid for intensities of 50% to 85% VO2max and that data from either the cycle ergometer or the treadmill can be used to prepare exercise prescriptions."
