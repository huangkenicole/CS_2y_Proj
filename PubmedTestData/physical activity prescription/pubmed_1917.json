        "The intensity progression of core stabilization exercises (CSEs) is usually based on personal criteria rather than on objective parameters. To develop exercise progressions for four of the most common CSEs based on the postural control challenge imposed on the participants, and to analyze the effect of participants' sex and postural control level on these progressions.",
        "Seventy-six males and females performed five variations of front bridge, back bridge, side bridge and bird-dog exercises on two force platforms. The mean velocity of the center of pressure displacement was calculated to assess exercise intensity through the measurement of the participants' body sway (PBS).",
        "In general, long bridges produced higher PBS than short bridges, bridging with single leg support produced higher PBS than bridging with double leg support and bridging on a hemisphere ball produced higher PBS than bridging on the floor. The most difficult bridging variations were those performed on a hemisphere ball with single leg support. Regarding the bird-dog, two-point positions produced higher PBS than three-point positions and the positions performed on a hemisphere ball produced higher PBS than those performed on the floor.",
        "The CSE progressions obtained by males and females were very similar. However, the participants with high trunk control showed less significant differences between exercise variations than the participants with low trunk control, which shows the need to individualize the progressions according to the participants' training level. Overall, this study provides useful information to guide the prescription of CSE progressions in young physically active individuals."
