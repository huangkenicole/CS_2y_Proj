        "A survey of 47 cystic fibrosis referral centers was conducted to study the use of exercise in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A questionnaire with 5 brief questions concerning the prescription and application of exercise therapy was sent to the first 47 centers (38.5%) listed in the 1988 CF Foundation Directory, and 46 (97.9%) were returned. While all but one of the respondents recommend exercise at least to selected patients, and while 80.4% of the centers refer patients to summer camp programs, only 43.5% offer exercise stress testing and only 21.7% offer an exercise program for their patients. Most of the respondents who recommend exercise prescribe aerobic exercise, swimming being the most frequently chosen type. Although there is a large discrepancy between those centers that acknowledge the benefits of exercise and those that have arranged for regularly available exercise services, inroads have been made in utilizing this therapeutic tool for patients with CF."
