      "AbstractText": [
        "Patients suffering from a diabetic foot ulcer often receive a non-weight bearing prescription of the affected limb to promote healing. Total unilalteral offloading of the affected foot necessitates walking aids that require loading at the hands during ambulation. Excessive loading at the hands can increase of the risk of crutch palsy. In addition, certain walking aids can also be more strenuous and less comfortable to use than others, resulting in lower prescription compliance. This study aimed to investigate hand loading, rates of perceived exertion, and usability of typically prescribed walking aids in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.",
        "Twenty patients (12\u00a0F | 8\u00a0M, 61.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.36\u00a0yrs., 90.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.34\u00a0kg, 1.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0m) walked as much as 200\u00a0m without assistance and with crutches, walkers, and a wheeled knee walker instrumented with flexible force-sensing pads on walking aid handles. Patients rated exertion using a Modified Borg Scale and completed a System Usability Scale questionnaire after each walking condition with or without walking aids.",
        "Results show that using a wheeled knee walker required 94% less hand loading than crutches and walkers. Patients reported 45% lower exertion with the WKW compared to crutches and walkers, and scored the usability of the wheeled knee walker 106% higher than crutches and walkers.",
        "The wheeled knee walker could be the preferred walking aid for total unilateral offloading because of the reduced loading demand at the hands, lower exertion during use, and greater usability compared to crutches and walkers."
