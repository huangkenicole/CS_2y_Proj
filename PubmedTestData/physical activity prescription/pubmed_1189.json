        "We sought to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with attempting to lose weight and engaging in weight loss behaviors in a large, diverse sample of adults representative of the U.S.",
        "Respondents were 23,106 adults, free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, who participated in the 2005-2014\u202fyears of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and weight loss variables were obtained from a Weight History Questionnaire.",
        "PHQ-9 total was not associated with attempting to lose weight in the past year (OR\u202f=\u202f1.03, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.00-1.06, p\u202f=\u202f0.074; n\u202f=\u202f23,106). Among respondents who attempted to lose weight (n\u202f=\u202f9582), PHQ-9 total was associated with a lower odds of exercising (OR\u202f=\u202f0.84, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.79-0.89, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and a greater odds of skipping meals (OR\u202f=\u202f1.31, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.22-1.41, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), eating diet foods/products (OR\u202f=\u202f1.16, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.08-1.24, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), eating less food (OR\u202f=\u202f1.09, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.04-1.15, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), taking non-prescription supplements (OR\u202f=\u202f1.31, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.23-1.41, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), taking prescription diet pills (OR\u202f=\u202f1.28, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.10-1.49, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and taking laxatives/vomiting (OR\u202f=\u202f1.55, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.28-1.88, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).",
        "Although depressive symptoms were not associated with attempting to lose weight in the past year, adults who attempted to lose weight tended to employ potentially ineffective/unhealthy weight loss behaviors and avoid effective behaviors. This pattern of behaviors may be another mechanism that explains the excess risk of obesity in depressed adults and may be a modifiable target for future interventions. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study, reverse causality is a possibility. Future studies should investigate the prospective associations between depressive symptoms and weight loss behaviors."
