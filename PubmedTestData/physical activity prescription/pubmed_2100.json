        "Although the effectiveness of exercise as a treatment modality for the management of diabetes mellitus has long been recognized, a vital component of the exercise prescription has been overlooked. In addition to endurance training, resistance training may provide physiologic benefits to the individual with diabetes that, in some cases, may equal or exceed those gained through aerobic training. These benefits may include improved blood lipid profiles, increased absolute left ventricular wall contractility, decreased resting blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, improved glycemic control, improved muscular strength and endurance, and increased bone and connective tissue strength. By utilizing a combination of aerobic and resistance training, the individual with diabetes experiences a more comprehensive exercise program that can improve most areas of health and physical fitness. In addition, having a greater number of exercise modality options may enhance exercise compliance."
