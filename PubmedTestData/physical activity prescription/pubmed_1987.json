      "AbstractText": [
        "There is not a doubt that tailored exercise is an effective non-pharmacological approach for preventing, mitigating and even reversing ageing-related alterations. However, older adults are likely to experience prolonged periods of inactivity and training cessation periods as a consequence of falls or hospitalisation. Although recent evidence supports that exercise could have a protective effect and help in recovering, there is to date a lack of consensus about what kind of physical exercise prescription and training duration would produce better outcomes after training cessation periods. The current study will determine the effects that available exercise prescriptions produced in older adults in preserving physical conditioning following inactivity periods.",
        "A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in three databases, namely PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from inception to 1 February 2021. Only randomised controlled trials written in English or Spanish will be eligible. No year of publication restriction will be applied. Eligible studies will contain information on population (older adults over 60 years old), intervention (inactivity period, exercise programme their duration), comparator (treatment as usual or waiting list) and outcomes (strength, functional capacity, metabolic health and skeletal muscle structure). Two independent reviewers will (1) search, screen and select studies, (2) extract data about their main characteristics and (3) evaluate their methodological and reporting quality. When disagreements emerge, the reviewers will discuss to reach a consensus. We plan to conduct meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesise the effects under study.",
        "As systematic reviews use publicly available data, no formal ethical review and approval are needed. Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal(s) and presented at conferences.",
