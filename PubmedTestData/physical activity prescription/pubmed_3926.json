        "McNeill, C, Beaven, CM, McMaster, DT, and Gill, N. Survey of eccentric-based strength and conditioning practices in sport. J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 2769-2775, 2020-Eccentric-based training (ECC) has been shown to be an effective training strategy in athletes; however, despite the theoretical benefits, the uptake by practitioners is currently unknown. This study investigated the current ECC strength and conditioning practices that are implemented in the training of athletes. Two hundred twenty-four practitioners were electronically surveyed anonymously with 98 responses available for analysis. Nearly all respondents (96%) had prescribed ECC in the last 24 months. Sport performance (64%), injury prevention (24%), and rehabilitation (8%) were the top-ranked reasons to include ECC. Respondents programmed ECC for strength (35%), hypertrophy (19%), and power (18%). A majority of respondents did not monitor ECC load (58%) or use eccentric-specific testing (75%). Seventeen respondents commented that high-intensity training such as sprinting and change of direction, were avoided during ECC blocks. Eccentric-based training intensity was prescribed as percentage of 1 repetition maximum (34%), rate of perceived exertion (20%), or velocity (16%). Respondents indicated muscle soreness and concurrent high-intensity activities were concerns during ECC but reported not using eccentric monitoring or testing. The efficacy of ECC is well supported, yet there seems to be a lack of defined protocol for integrating ECC research into practice. A greater understanding of eccentric contribution to sport performance and injury prevention may help define testing and monitoring procedures for the prescription of ECC interventions. Practitioners should consider factors such as periodization, soreness, and monitoring when designing ECC programs. The findings of this survey indicate that no uniform strategies exist for the prescription of ECC among experienced practitioners."
