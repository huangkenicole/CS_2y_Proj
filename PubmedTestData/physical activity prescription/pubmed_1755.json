        "Post-exercise hypotension (PEH) may follow a session of physical exercises. This effect has high clinical relevance for hypertensive individuals. Although there are several studies on the subject, an analysis is still lacking on a state-of-art approach considering different types of exercises. Using a review of literature, the aim of this paper was to verify the relationship between aerobic exercise and resistance exercise in PEH in hypertensive people. For the purpose of this study, Scielo and Medlinedatabases were surveyed, and the main inclusion criteria were studies on the subject in English language and a sample of hypertensive adults. One hundred and twenty-six studies were found. However, only 32 papers, 5 of which on resistance exercise and 27 on aerobic exercise were used for this study. Although the studies surveyed used different prescription models for resistance exercise, PEH was observed mainly in the laboratory setting. After aerobic exercise, it was noted that PEH occurred for longer periods. However, there are differences of opinion as to the best intensity and duration of the exercise to be prescribed. Therefore, in hypertensive individuals declines in arterial pressure following aerobic exercise are apparently greater than those observed with resistance exercise. Nevertheless, in order to achieve sounder conclusions, further studies on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be conducted."
