        "Eccentric muscle actions generate high levels of force at a low metabolic cost, making them a suitable training modality to combat age-related neuromuscular decline. The temporary muscle soreness associated with high intensity eccentric contractions may explain their limited use in clinical exercise prescription, however any discomfort is often alleviated after the initial bout (repeated bout effect). Therefore, the aims of the present study were to examine the acute and repeated bout effects of eccentric contractions on neuromuscular factors associated with the risk of falling in older adults.",
        "Balance, functional ability [timed up-and-go and sit-to-stand], and lower-limb maximal and explosive strength were measured in 13 participants (67.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 year) pre- and post-eccentric exercise (0, 24, 48, and 72\u00a0hr) in Bout 1 and 14\u00a0days later in Bout 2. The eccentric exercise intervention was performed on an isokinetic unilateral stepper ergometer at 50% of maximal eccentric strength at 18 step\u2027min<sup>-1</sup> per limb for 7\u00a0min (126 steps per limb). Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to identify any significant effects (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).",
        "Eccentric strength significantly decreased (-\u00a013%) in Bout 1 at 24\u00a0hr post-exercise; no significant reduction was observed at any other time-point after Bout 1. No significant reductions occurred in static balance or functional ability at any time-point in either bout.",
        "Submaximal multi-joint eccentric exercise results in minimal disruption to neuromuscular function associated with falls in older adults after the initial bout."
