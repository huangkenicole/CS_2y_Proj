      "AbstractText": [
        "In Sweden, physical activity on prescription (PAP) is used to support patients in increasing their levels of physical activity (PA). The role of healthcare professionals in supporting PA behavior change requires optimization in terms of knowledge, quality and organization. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of support from a physiotherapist (PT) compared to continued PAP at a healthcare center (HCC) for patients who remained insufficiently active after 6-month PAP treatment at the HCC. The PT strategy was constituted by a higher follow-up frequency as well as by aerobic physical fitness tests. The analysis was based on an RCT with a three-year time horizon, including 190 patients aged 27-77 with metabolic risk factors. The cost per QALY for the PT strategy compared to the HCC strategy was USD 16,771 with a societal perspective (including individual PA expenses, production loss and time cost for exercise, as well as healthcare resource use) and USD 33,450 with a healthcare perspective (including only costs related to healthcare resource use). Assuming a willingness-to-pay of USD 57,000 for a QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness for the PT strategy was 0.5 for the societal perspective and 0.6 for the healthcare perspective. Subgroup analyses on cost-effectiveness based on individual characteristics regarding enjoyment, expectations and confidence indicated potential in identifying cost-effective strategies based on mediating factors. However, this needs to be further explored. In conclusion, both PT and HCC interventions are similar from a cost-effectiveness perspective, indicating that both strategies are equally valuable in healthcare's range of treatments."
