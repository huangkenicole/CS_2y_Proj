        "Isometric exercise (IE) and isometric wall squat (IWS) training have been shown to be effective methods of reducing arterial blood pressure. However, most IE interventions require methodologies and equipment that could present a barrier to participation. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an accessible RPE prescribed IWS intervention.",
        "Thirty normotensive and pre-hypertensive adults were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two 4-week home-based\u00a0IWS intervention groups: the first group conducted IWS exercise where intensity was prescribed and monitored using RPE (RPE-EX), whilst the other used a previously validated HR prescription method (HR-EX). Resting and ambulatory heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were measured pre- and post-intervention.",
        "Minimum clinically important differences (MCID; -\u00a05\u00a0mmHg) in SBP and/or DBP were shown in 100% of intervention participants. Statistically significant reductions were shown in resting seated BP (RPE-EX: SBP: -\u00a09\u2009\u00b1\u20096, DBP: -\u00a06\u2009\u00b1\u20094, MAP: -\u00a06\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0mmHg; HR-EX: SBP: -\u00a014\u2009\u00b1\u20096, DBP: -\u00a06\u2009\u00b1\u20094, MAP: -\u00a08\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u00a0mmHg), supine BP (RPE-EX: SBP: -\u00a08 (-\u00a05), DBP: -\u00a08 (-\u00a07), MAP: -\u00a08 (-\u00a04) mmHg; HR-EX: SBP: -\u00a05 (-\u00a04), MAP -\u00a05 (-\u00a04) mmHg), and ambulatory SBP (RPE-EX: -\u00a08\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0mmHg; HR-EX: -\u00a010\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u00a0mmHg) following the interventions. There were no statistically significant differences between intervention groups in the magnitude of BP reduction.",
        "RPE prescribed IWS exercise can provide an effective and more accessible method for reducing BP at home, providing reductions comparable to the current HR-based prescription method."
