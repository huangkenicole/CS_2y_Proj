        "Evidence indicates that the burden of sleep disorders is increasing, yet recent trends have not been examined.",
        "To examine the prevalence of and trends in sleep patterns and medications commonly used for insomnia (MCUFI) in US adults from 2005 through 2018.",
        "A total of 39,749 participants aged 20 years or older from 7 consecutive National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles during 2005-2018 were included.",
        "The age-standardized prevalence of trouble sleeping and using MCUFI was higher in women than men, but men tended to sleep less (sleep duration <7 hours) and were more likely to have sleep disorders. The temporal trends in sleep disorders and MCUFI were similar in men and women, except that trouble sleeping increased more in men (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024). The prevalence of insufficient sleep decreased from 33.6% in women and 38.1% in men in 2005-2006 to 20.5% in women and 28.6% in men in 2017-2018. The prevalence of MCUFI use was 13.3% in women and 8.9% in men in 2005-2006, peaked at 15.2% for men and 17.0% for women in 2013-2014, and decreased slightly in 2015-2018.",
        "The prevalence of trouble sleeping and MCUFI use was higher in women, while the prevalence of short sleep duration and sleep disorders was higher in men. Sleep disorders, abnormal sleep duration, and MCUFI use increased at a broadly similar pace in men and women, except that trouble sleeping increased more in men."
