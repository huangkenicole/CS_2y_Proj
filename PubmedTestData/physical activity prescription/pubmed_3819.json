        "The Achilles tendon stores and releases strain energy, influencing running economy. The present study aims to verify the influence of the Achilles tendon tangent modulus, as a material property, on running economy by comparing two groups of elite endurance-performance athletes undergoing different running training volumes. Twelve athletes, six long-distance runners and six pentathletes, were studied. Long-distance runners had a higher weekly running training volume (116.7\u00b113.7 vs. 58.3\u00b120.4 km, p<0.05) and a better running economy (204.3\u00b112.0 vs. 222.0\u00b18.7 O<sub>2</sub> mL\u2009\u2219\u2009kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009\u2219\u2009km<sup>\u22121</sup>, p<0.05) evaluated in a treadmill at 16 km\u00b7h<sup>\u20131</sup>, 1% inclination. Both groups presented similar VO<sub>2max</sub> (68.5\u00b13.8 vs. 65.7\u00b15.0 mL\u2009\u2219\u2009min<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009\u2219\u2009kg<sup>\u22121</sup>, p>0.05). Achilles tendon tangent modulus was estimated from ultrasound-measured deformations, with the ankle passively mobilized by a dynamometer. True stress was calculated from the measured torque. The long-distance runners had a higher maximum tangent modulus (380.6\u00b192.2 vs. 236.2\u00b182.6 MPa, p<0.05) and maximum true stress than pentathletes (24.2\u00b15.1 vs. 16.0\u00b13.5 MPa, p<0.05). The correlation coefficient between tangent modulus at larger deformations was R=\u20130.7447 (p<0.05). Quantifying tendon tissue adaptations associated with different running training volumes will support subject and modality-specific workouts prescription of elite endurance athletes."
