      "AbstractText": [
        "Although a variety of interventions in many countries have been developed to increase park use and to improve public participation in physical activities in parks, knowledge of their overall effectiveness is lacking. A systematic literature review was undertaken to further understand the effectiveness of various interventions that aim to increase the use of parks and physical activity participation in parks. This systematic review utilized the standard Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis procedure, and of the 3801 studies identified, 60 studies were reviewed in-depth, with 44 studies assessed for quality of evidence and risk of bias. Most of the 44 reviewed studies found that various interventions had positive impacts on park use and physical activity participation in parks. Interventions were classified into both demand and supply, with more studies focusing on the supply side. The strongest evidence on the effectiveness of various interventions was found for park prescriptions; safe access to parks; playgrounds, and park renovation and renewal/design. However, the assessment of quality of evidence and risk of bias showed that most studies suffer from potential biases and evidence weaknesses, suggesting a need to further establish external validity."
