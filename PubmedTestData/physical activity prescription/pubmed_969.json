        "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent joint disorder in seniors. Systematic reviews suggest that conservative treatment is effective and preferred in mild-moderate cases. The objective of this study was to examine the proportion of patients receiving physiotherapy, exercise or walking aids, and to explore factors associated with their prescription. We conducted a retrospective survey of patients about to undergo total hip arthroplasty for hip osteoarthritis. Patients were asked about past prescriptions for cane use, physiotherapy and exercise. Of 161 patients (36.6% male, mean age 68.7+/-10.1 years), 76% were prescribed a cane (adherence=86.2%). The main reason for not using a cane was vanity. Of the 28.0% patients prescribed physiotherapy, 73.3% received exercises compared to only 2.6% of non-physiotherapy patients. Patients who were older or worked in manual labour were more likely to be prescribed a cane and less likely to be prescribed physiotherapy or exercises. Men were less likely than women to be prescribed all three, but only cane use was statistically significant across genders. In conclusion, physiotherapy and exercise are not commonly prescribed in patients with hip OA."
