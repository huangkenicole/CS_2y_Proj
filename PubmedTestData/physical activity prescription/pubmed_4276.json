        "In Germany, Tocilizumab (TCZ) is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis both in biologic-na\u00efve patients and those with previous failures of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The long-term effectiveness and retention rates of TCZ in patients with different numbers of prior bDMARD failures has rarely been investigated. We included 885 RA patients in the analyses, enrolled with the start of TCZ between 2009 and 2015 in the German biologics register RABBIT. Patients were stratified according to prior bDMARD failures: no prior bDMARD or 1, 2 or \u2265\u00a03 bDMARD failures. We applied Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox-regression to examine treatment adherence as well as linear mixed effects models to investigate effectiveness over 3\u00a0years of follow-up. Compared to biologic-na\u00efve patients, those with prior bDMARD failures at start of TCZ were younger but had significantly longer disease duration and more comorbidities. DAS28 at baseline and loss of physical function were highest in patients with \u2265\u00a03 bDMARD failures. During follow-up, patients with up to two bDMARD failures on average reached low disease activity (LDA, DAS28 <\u00a03.2). Those with \u2265\u00a03 prior bDMARDs had a slightly lower response. However, after 3\u00a0years, nearly 50% of them achieved LDA. Treatment continuation on TCZ therapy was similar in patients with \u2264\u00a02 bDMARD failures but significantly lower in those with \u2265\u00a03 bDMARD failures. TCZ seems to be similarly effective in patients with no, one or two prior bDMARD failures. The majority of patients achieved LDA already after 6\u00a0months and maintained it over a period of 3\u00a0years. TCZ proved effective even in the high-risk group of patients with more than two prior bDMARD failures."
