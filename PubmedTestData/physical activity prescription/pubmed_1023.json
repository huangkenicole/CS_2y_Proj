        "A pregnant woman participated in cycling events in the 2000 Olympics. Recently there was concern about the participation of a pregnant woman in the Australian netball team. More and more women are anxious to pursue sports during their pregnancies and to maintain condition. For the clinician or sports physician caring for women who want to maintain a high-level of physical activity there is no simple exercise prescription. It is probable that continuing exercise by women who are already conditioned will not result in foetal compromise, unless there are hidden or unknown complications of pregnancy. Pregnant women should probably exercise within limits that do not cause severe discomfort and should, as pregnancy progresses, be prepared to moderate the intensity and duration of their exercise programs to avoid risks and injury. It is probably not advisable for women to begin high intensity exercise programs when pregnant, although moderate exercise is beneficial to both mother and baby. The type of activity that is undertaken has to be taken into consideration and in particular the adverse effects of supine activity in late gestation recognised."
