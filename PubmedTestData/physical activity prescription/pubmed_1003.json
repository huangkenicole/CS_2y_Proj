        "The review addresses the role of exercise in triggering ventricular arrhythmias and promoting disease progression in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) patients and gene-mutation carriers, the differential diagnosis between AC and athlete's heart and current recommendations on exercise activity in AC.",
        "AC is an inherited heart muscle disease caused by genetically defective cell-to-cell adhesion structures (mainly desmosomes). The pathophysiological hallmark of the disease is progressive myocyte loss and replacement by fibro-fatty tissue, which creates the substrates for ventricular arrhythmias. Animal and human studies demonstrated that intense exercise, but not moderate physical activity, may increase disease penetrance, worsen the phenotype, and favor life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. It has been proposed that in some individuals prolonged endurance sports activity may in itself cause AC (so-called exercise-induced AC). The studies agree that intense physical activity should be avoided in patients with AC and healthy gene-mutation carriers. However, low-to-moderate intensity exercise does not appear detrimental and these patients should not be entirely deprived from the many health benefits of physical activity."
