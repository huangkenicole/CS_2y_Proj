        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of using the critical velocity (CV) concept to prescribe two separate high-intensity interval training (HIT) exercise programs aimed at enhancing CV and load carriage performance. 20 young adult participants (male = 15, female = 5) underwent a 4-week training period where they exercised 2\u00a0d<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>\u00a0</mi></math>wk<sup>-1</sup>. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) HIT or (2) Load Carriage-HIT (LCHIT). Pre- and post-training assessments included running 3-minute All-Out Test (3MT) to determine critical velocity (CV) and distance prime (<i>D</i>') and two load carriage tasks (400 and 3200\u2009m). There were significant increases in CV (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.005) and velocity at <i>V</i>\u02d9 O<sub>2max</sub> (<i>v</i><i>V</i>\u02d9 O<sub>2max</sub>) (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.037) among the sample but not between training groups. Improvements were observed in 3200\u2009m load carriage performance time (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) with a 9.8 and 5.4% decrease in the LCHIT and HIT groups, respectively. <b>Practitioner summary:</b> Critical velocity has shown efficacy as a marker for performance in tactical populations. With the addition of load carriage, there is a reduction in the individual's CV. The CV-concept-prescribed exercises (HIT and LCHIT) 2 days per week for 4 weeks showed improvements in CV, <i>v</i><i>V</i>\u02d9 O<sub>2max</sub> and load carriage performance. The use of the CV concept provides a method to prescribe HIT to increase running and load carriage performances in tactical populations."
