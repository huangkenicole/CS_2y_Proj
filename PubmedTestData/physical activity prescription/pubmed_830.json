        "and Purpose: Breast pain is a common condition presented at breast care clinics and bras are often recommended to reduce symptoms, although criteria and pathways for obtaining appropriate bras are limited. This multi-study, randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to establish criteria and performance variables to prescribe bras for breast pain patients, to implement this bra prescription, and evaluate whether, compared to standard care alone, the bra prescription improves breast pain and quality of life (QoL).",
        "Eighteen breast pain patients from a UK hospital were assigned to standard care or bra prescription groups and completed the study. Bra prescription patients were prescribed a bra to wear every day for eight weeks. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), breast pain intensity, QoL, and adherence were assessed.",
        "Between-groups there were no differences in baseline breast pain or QoL and no differences in PGIC or breast pain following the intervention. Within-groups, improvements in QoL within bra prescription patients were identified.",
        "This study developed a framework for bra prescription for breast pain patients and the intervention demonstrated improvements in QoL."
