        "The optimal approach to prescribing resistance training (RT) combined with aerobic training (AT) for psychosocial and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is unclear.",
        "To compare the effects of AT combined with RT (1 versus 3 sets) versus AT alone on HRQOL and psychosocial outcomes.",
        "Subjects (N.=72) were randomized to AT (5 d\u2219wk-1) or AT (3 d\u2219wk-1) with either 1 set (AT/RT1) or 3 sets (AT/RT3) of RT performed 2 d\u2219wk-1.",
        "Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.",
        "Subjects with coronary artery disease.",
        "HRQOL and psychosocial parameters were assessed before and after 29 weeks of training by questionnaire.",
        "Fifty-three subjects (mean\u00b1SD age 60.6\u00b110.6 years) completed training. There was a group effect for change in self-efficacy of lower body physical activity tasks (P=0.03) with significantly greater improvement for AT/RT3 than AT alone (17.5\u00b116.6% vs. 3.2\u00b112.8% respectively, p=0.04). Lower body self-efficacy improved for AT/RT1 (15.5\u00b113.8%, p<0.001) but not for AT alone (P=0.2). Self-efficacy for upper body tasks improved with AT/RT3 (18.2\u00b119.9%, P=0.003) and AT/RT1 training (12.6\u00b115.8%, P=0.005) but not with AT alone (8.3\u00b116.1%, P=0.1). AT/RT3 and AT/RT1 training yielded improvements in depression score (-4.0\u00b17.7, P=0.04 and -3.0\u00b15.1, P=0.02 respectively) but not with AT alone (-0.5\u00b14.7, P=0.71). The improvement from baseline in physical HRQOL score (MOS, SF-36) averaged 8.2\u00b111.2% for AT (P=0.04), 10.4\u00b111.9% for AT/RT1 (P=0.006) and 12.0\u00b112.9% for AT/RT3 (P=0.004).",
        "Both AT+RT groups with either 1 or 3 sets (AT 3 d\u2219wk-1and RT 2 d\u2219wk-1) each yield more pronounced psychosocial and HRQOL adaptations than AT alone (5 d\u2219wk-1). RT prescription beyond 1 set may further augment selected parameters in cardiac patients.",
        "These results provide further rationale to develop combined AT+RT regimens for individuals with coronary artery disease."
