        "Human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) is a major problem among people living with HIV/aids. The exercise training has been used for its treatment; however, the knowledge about benefits and safety still is emerging. The aim was systematically review the literature for physiological, metabolic, immunologic, and morphologic adaptations to aerobic, resistance, and concurrent training in people living with HALS.",
        "A search of the Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Lilacs, Scielo, Web of Science, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Library and PEDro was performed. The study selection was performed by two blinded researchers follow screening of titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Therefore, only randomised clinical trials, which investigated the effects of physical training in people with HALS, were included in the present review. The risk of bias was assessed using a Jadad's scale.",
        "From the electronic and manual searches, 332 studies were selected by title, 139 abstracts were read and 95 were excluded, leaving 44 studies, which were read in full. After full text examination only five studies were included in the qualitative analyses. The limitations were: heterogeneity in training prescription, nutritional recommendations, and diagnosis of lipodystrophy, small sample size, utilization of methods with questionable validity for assessments.",
        "There is no effect of physical training on CD4 cell count. In addition, aerobic and concurrent training improve VO2max, likewise resistance and concurrent training improve muscular strength."
