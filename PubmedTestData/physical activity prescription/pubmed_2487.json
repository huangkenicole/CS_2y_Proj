      "AbstractText": [
        "Moderate intensity exercise ranging 40-60% of maximum oxygen uptake is advised to promote energy expenditure and fat oxidation in overweight and obese people. Although fat oxidation has been shown to be highly variable among individual, there is still a relative uncertainty regarding exercise prescription for women specifically. This article aimed to determine whether indicators of body composition can be used to narrow the exercise intensity range for exercise prescription in women.",
        "A total of 35 healthy women (age 30.8\u00b19.5 yr) classified according to their BMI in normal weight (NOR; \u226424.9 kg\u00b7m2), overweight (OVW; 25-29.9 kg\u00b7m2) and obese groups (OBE; \u226530 kg\u00b7m2) completed a submaximal graded test (intensities eliciting ~30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of maximum oxygen uptake). Blood lactate, perceived exertion and absolute and relative substrate oxidation for fat (OXFAT) and carbohydrates (OXCHO) were measured at each stage.",
        "Perceived exertion and blood lactate increased as a function of exercise but did not differ across groups. There were no significant changes in absolute and relative OXFAT across groups, or as a function of exercise intensity. Peak OXFAT occurred at the 40%, 50% and 40% stages for NOR, OVW and OBE groups, respectively, with no significant differences across groups.",
        "We measured no differences, but considerable inter-individual variation, in fat oxidation in women of different body composition. This result is in agreement with previous research based on exercise performed at constant rate and in independent participant groups. Our findings do not support the fat oxidation hypothesis, and further emphasise the perspective that exercise prescription should be individualised and likely be based on considerations other than substrate oxidation."
