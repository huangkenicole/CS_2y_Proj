        "ABSTRACTBackground:Getting lost is a recognized complication in patients with dementia. Preventive measures are lacking. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a home-based missing incident prevention program (HMIPP) in reducing missing incidents, time of searching, and caregivers' stress.",
        "The design was a pre- and post-intervention study. Patients were recruited from a hospital-based Geriatric Memory Clinic. Inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 60 years or above, established dementia, and Modified Functional Ambulation Categories score VI or VII. An occupational therapist performed the interventions at the patients's home. These included dementia education, prescription of assistive devices, on-site skills training, environmental modifications, community service referrals, and redesigning of daily life routine tasks. The number of missing incidents and caregivers' stress at three months and one year were compared with baseline data from one year before and the secondary outcome was time for searching of the last incident.",
        "A total of 54 patients were recruited. The mean age was 78.8 years and 54% were females. Majority of patients had moderate dementia. The mean number of missing incidents per year was significantly reduced at three months and one year (0.70, 0.22, and 0.14 at 0, 3, and 12 months, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The time for searching of last missing episode was reduced significantly (6.25, 0.13, and 0.35 hours, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The caregivers' stress also decreased significantly at three months and one year.",
        "The HMIPP was effective in reducing the number of missing incidents, searching time, and caregivers' stress at three months and one year."
