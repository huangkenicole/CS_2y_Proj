        "Physical inactivity is a major modifiable contributor to the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.",
        "In this article, a clinical case study is used to provide practical approaches for general practitioners and their teams to individualise exercise prescriptions for patients with hypertension who are at risk of CVD. The case presented describes a sedentary, overweight male with newly diagnosed hypertension - a\u00a0common scenario in general practice.",
        "The many benefits of exercise are supported by an expanding body of research. Blood pressure can be safely and effectively reduced through physical activity, leading to a lower CVD risk. Value-based goal setting and the 'FITT' framework may be used to facilitate sustainable physical activity among patients. The engagement of allied health\u00a0professionals such as exercise physiologists may also be beneficial."
