        "Investigate the effect of exercise for adults with cerebral palsy (CP) on quality of life, participation (attendance and involvement in life situations), functional mobility, pain, fatigue, mood, and self-efficacy.",
        "A systematic review was completed. Twelve databases were searched from inception to August 2022 for studies including participants (\u226516\u2009years) with cerebral palsy, and that evaluated an exercise intervention. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data.",
        "Seventeen studies (total <i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009532) were included: 12 randomised control trials, four non-randomised trials, and one single case experimental design. Interventions studied were predominantly strength, aerobic or treadmill training, dance, and swimming. No study assessed participation, pain or mood. Of two studies that assessed quality of life, one reported a positive effect on an aspect of mental health immediately after the programme finished. All studies assessed functional mobility, but only one reported a positive effect. One study assessed self-efficacy and found no effect, and another assessed fatigue and reported conflicting results.",
        "The effect of exercise for adults with CP, on outcomes that adults report as important to them - quality of life, participation, pain, mood, and fatigue - are unknown.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTo address outcomes important to adults with cerebral palsy (CP), it is important to understand how exercise affects participation and quality of life.All modes of exercise reviewed appear safe for adults with CP and choice should be based on the client's preferences, access to services, and convenience.Addressing any needed accommodations in the environment and context is likely more important than exercise prescription parameters when tailoring exercise to meet the needs of adults with CP and sustain participation."
