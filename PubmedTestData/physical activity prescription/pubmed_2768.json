        "Gait pattern classification in individuals with lower-limb amputation could help in developing personalized prosthetic prescriptions and tailored gait rehabilitation. However, systematic classifications of gait patterns in this population have been scarcely explored. This study aimed to determine whether the gait patterns in individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation (UTFA) can be clustered into homogeneous subgroups using spatiotemporal parameters across a range of walking speeds. We examined spatiotemporal gait parameters, including step length and cadence, in 25 individuals with UTFA (functional level K3 or K4, all non-vascular amputations) while they walked on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at eight speeds. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to identify clusters with homogeneous gait patterns based on the relationships between step length and cadence. Furthermore, after cluster formation, post-hoc analyses were performed to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and demographic data among the clusters. HCA identified three homogeneous gait pattern clusters, suggesting that individuals with UTFA have several gait patterns. Further, we found significant differences in the participants' body height, sex ratio, and their prosthetic knee component among the clusters. Therefore, gait rehabilitation should be individualized based on body size and prosthetic prescription."
