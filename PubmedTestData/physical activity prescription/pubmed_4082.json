        "To assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of a home-based integrated physical exercise and bladder-training program vs usual care in community-dwelling women with urinary incontinence (UI).",
        "We conducted a parallel arm, nonblinded, pilot randomized controlled trial of a home-based integrated physical exercise and bladder training with urge suppression and fall prevention program (ExerciseUP) vs usual care in women aged 65 and older with UI. Outcomes included feasibility (process, resources, management, and acceptability), urinary symptoms, and falls risk using self-administered questionnaires. Objective physical activity was measured using accelerometry.",
        "A total of 37 of 38 (97%) eligible women were willing to participate in the study. In the ExerciseUP intervention cohort, 17 of 19 (89%) women completed all 6 weeks of intervention and follow-up, and 16 of 18 (89%) women in the usual group completed follow-up. Ten (53%) women in the ExerciseUP group achieved at least 70% adherence to exercise prescription. The improvement in UI severity scores from baseline was greater in the ExerciseUP intervention group than the usual care group (-\u20096.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 vs -\u20092.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Fall-risk score decreased (improved) in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in change in physical activity or sedentary behavior.",
        "We determined that it would be feasible to conduct a home-based exercise intervention in older women with UI. Our clinical outcomes were modestly favorable for the ExerciseUP intervention group."
