        "This study compared the effect of treadmill running on subsequent upper limb exercise performance in young men.",
        "Seventeen young men (24.8\u00b15.2 years) completed a: 1) bench press resistance exercise control session; 2) treadmill interval running protocol followed by the bench press session; and 3) treadmill continuous running protocol followed by the bench press session. Four sets of the bench press exercise were performed at 80% of 1RM up to volitional failure. In the interval protocol, eight sprints of 40s at 100% of the velocity of maximal oxygen uptake, with 20s of passive interval between them were performed, whereas in the continuous protocol 30-min of treadmill running at 90% of the heart rate corresponding to second ventilatory threshold was performed. The number of maximal repetitions completed in each set and condition was recorded and compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA.",
        "The interval protocol (18.7\u00b14.9 repetitions) resulted in a reduction in the number of bench press repetitions compared to the control protocol (21.4\u00b15.4 repetitions) (P=0.002); whereas continuous running did not affect the bench press performance (20.6\u00b14.4 repetitions). The total number of repetitions reduced from set to set in all protocols (P<0.001).",
        "The results evidenced an impairment in the upper limb strength performance after high intensity interval, but not moderate intensity continuous running, which has implication for concurrent training planning and prescription."
