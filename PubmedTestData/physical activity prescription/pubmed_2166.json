        "In an analysis of the physical demands when running with the ball in professional soccer, this study (1) determined activity profiles during match-play, (2) examined effects of fatigue, and (3) investigated differences according to playing position. Thirty French League 1 matches from two competitive seasons (2007-2008, 2008-2009) were analysed using multi-camera computerized tracking. Players (n = 28) ran a mean total distance of 191 +/- 38 m with the ball, of which 34.3% was covered at speeds >19.1 km . h(-1), 25.6% between 14.1 and 19.0 km . h(-1), 12.5% between 11.1 and 14.0 km . h(-1), and 27.6% at <11.0 km . h(-1). Mean distance covered per possession was 4.2 +/- 0.7 m, speed at ball reception was 10.3 +/- 0.9 km . h(-1), while mean and peak speed during runs was 12.9 +/- 1.0 km . h(-1) and 24.9 +/- 2.4 km . h(-1), respectively. Mean time in possession, duration, and touches per possession were 53.4 +/- 8.1 s, 1.1 +/- 0.1 s, and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively. There were differences across playing positions for all variables (P at least 0.017 and effect size at least 0.54). Total distance run did not differ between halves but varied over the course of matches (P < 0.001), decreasing just before half-time. These findings provide valuable information about the physical and technical requirements of running with the ball that could be useful in the prescription of general and individualized training programmes."
