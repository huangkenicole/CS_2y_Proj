      "AbstractText": [
        "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver, is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Recent findings have shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can reduce liver fat but it is unclear whether this form of exercise is superior to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).",
        "The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effect of HIIT vs MICT on liver fat in adults. A secondary aim was to investigate the interaction between total weekly exercise volume and exercise-related energy expenditure and change in liver fat.",
        "Relevant databases were searched up to December 2020 for randomized trials, comparing HIIT to control, MICT to control, or HIIT to MICT. Studies were excluded if they did not implement 2 or more weeks' intervention or assess liver fat using magnetic resonance-based techniques. Weighted mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated. Regression analyses were undertaken to determine the interaction between weekly exercise volume in minutes and kilocalories (kcal) with change in liver fat content.",
        "Of the 28 268 studies screened, 19 were included involving 745 participants. HIIT and MICT both elicited moderate reductions in liver fat content when compared to control (HIIT: -2.85%, 95% CI, -4.86 to -0.84, P\u2005=\u2005.005, I2\u2005=\u20050%, n\u2005=\u2005114, low-certainty evidence; MICT: -3.14%, 95% CI, -4.45 to -1.82, P\u2005<\u2005.001, I2\u2005=\u20055.2%, n\u2005=\u2005533, moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference between HIIT and MICT (-0.34%, 95% CI, -2.20 to 1.52, P\u2005=\u2005.721, I2\u2005=\u20050%, n\u2005=\u2005177, moderate-certainty evidence). Neither total exercise volume in minutes (\u03b2\u2005=\u2005.0002, SE\u2005=\u20050.0017, Z\u2005=\u20050.13, P\u2005=\u2005.89) nor exercise-related energy expenditure in kcal (\u03b2\u2005=\u2005.0003, SE\u2005=\u20050.0002, Z\u2005=\u20051.21, P\u2005=\u2005.23) were related to changes in liver fat content.",
        "HIIT elicits comparable improvements in liver fat to MICT despite often requiring less energy and time commitment. Further studies should be undertaken to assess the relative importance of aerobic exercise prescription variables, such as intensity, on liver fat."
