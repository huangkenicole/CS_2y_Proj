        "Heart rate drifts upward over time during interval exercise and during exercise in hot conditions. As such, work rate must be lowered to maintain target heart rate. The purpose was to characterize acute work rate adjustments during high-intensity interval training based on target heart rate. Seven humans (three females) completed five study visits: a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer to measure maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) in \u223c22\u00a0\u00b0C and four trials performed in \u223c22\u00a0\u00b0C (TEMP) or \u223c35\u00a0\u00b0C (HOT), consisting of an 8 min warm-up at 70% HR<sub>max</sub> followed by one (15<sub>TEMP</sub> and 15<sub>HOT</sub>) or five (43<sub>TEMP</sub> and 43<sub>HOT</sub>) rounds of high-intensity interval training (one round = 4\u00a0min work at 90% HR<sub>max</sub> and 3\u00a0min recovery at 70% HR<sub>max</sub>) totaling 15\u00a0min or 43\u00a0min of exercise, respectively. Work rate was lowered 33 \u00b1 20\u00a0W (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in 43<sub>TEMP</sub> and 56 \u00b1 30\u00a0W (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in 43<sub>HOT</sub> between the first and fifth work intervals. Thermal strain (0.2\u00a0\u00b0C higher rectal temperature, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and cardiovascular strain (6 beats\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> larger increase in heart rate from first to fifth recovery interval, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.01) were greater in 43<sub>HOT</sub> versus 43<sub>TEMP</sub>. Using target heart rate during high-intensity interval training may reduce the training stimulus, especially in hot environments, but it may also limit thermal strain and enable participants to complete the prescribed workout despite the heat."
