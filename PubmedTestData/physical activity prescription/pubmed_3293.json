        "People with spinal cord injuries (SCIs), particularly those with injuries causing tetraplegia, are at risk for cardiovascular illnesses. There is a compelling need to address poor cardiovascular health as early as possible after cervical SCI. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the process of aerobic exercise prescription during inpatient rehabilitation for cervical SCI.",
        "The patient was a 22-year-old man who had sustained a complete C5 SCI during a swimming accident 12 weeks before he participated in an aerobic exercise program. The program was developed to facilitate aerobic capacity while minimizing muscular fatigue. The patient attended 18 sessions over a 2-month period.",
        "The patient's exercise tolerance increased in terms of both exercise duration and exercise intensity. Measurements of cardiovascular health, taken before and after training, revealed substantial increases in peak oxygen uptake (20%) and orthostatic tolerance over the course of the program.",
        "The patient experienced typical complications associated with acute SCI (eg, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infections). He exhibited several signs of improved exercise tolerance and wheelchair mobility during the 2-month program, indicating potential cardiovascular and functional improvements from the exercise training."
