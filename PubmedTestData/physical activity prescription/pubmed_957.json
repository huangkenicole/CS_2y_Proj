        "Exercise training is an effective and safe second-line therapy for improving multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms and disease progression among adults. This study aimed to determine the appropriateness of a novel exercise training program for wheelchair users with MS. Ten wheelchair users with MS were recruited from a previous cross-sectional research study to attend one of three focus groups with 3-4 participants that lasted between 69 and 87\u00a0min. The focus groups were conducted online using a semi-structured format and participants were invited to complete an evaluation survey. During the focus groups, participants provided qualitative feedback regarding the exercise prescription, exercise modes (resistance and aerobic), training manual, exercise equipment, fitness tracker, rating scale, newsletters, logbook, and coaching. Most feedback focused on minor considerations such as avoiding the color red as it can be an issue for individuals with optic neuritis. Among quantitative evaluation survey ratings, coaching calls were rated the highest 4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 on a 5-point scale, followed by the exercise prescription (4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8) and fitness tracker (4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9). Focus group participants provided invaluable feedback for finalizing a novel exercise training program for wheelchair users with MS and provided focal suggestions for further improvements."
