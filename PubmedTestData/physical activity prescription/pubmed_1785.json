        "Lewis, MH, Siedler, MR, Lamadrid, P, Ford, S, Smith, T, SanFilippo, G, Waddell, B, Trexler, ET, Buckner, S, and Campbell, BI. Sex differences may exist for performance fatigue but not recovery after single-joint upper-body and lower-body resistance exercise. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1498-1505, 2022-This study evaluated sex differences in performance recovery and fatigue during dynamic exercise. Twenty-eight resistance-trained males (n = 16) and females (n = 12) completed a repeated-measures, randomized, parallel-groups design. The protocol consisted of a baseline assessment, a recovery period (4, 24, or 48 hours), and a postrecovery assessment. The assessments were identical consisting of 4 sets of 10 repetition maximum (10RM) bicep curls and 4 sets of 10RM leg extensions to failure. Recovery was quantified as the number of total repetitions completed in the postrecovery bout. Fatigue was quantified as the number of repetitions completed set to set within the session. For analysis, we set the level of significance at p \u2264 0.05. No sex differences in performance recovery were observed across any of the investigated time periods for either exercise modality. Regarding fatigue, significant effects were observed for set (p < 0.001) and sex (p = 0.031) for bicep curls. Repetitions dropped in later sets, and females generally completed a greater number of repetitions than males (8.8 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 7.2 \u00b1 0.5). For leg extension, a significant sex \u00d7 set interaction was observed (p = 0.003), but post hoc tests revealed these sex differences as marginal. Our results suggest that in dynamic bicep curls and leg extensions, other factors unrelated to sex may be more impactful on performance recovery. To optimize an athlete's desired adaptations, it may be more important to consider other variables unrelated to sex such as volume, perceived exertion, and training history when formulating training prescriptions for single-joint exercises."
