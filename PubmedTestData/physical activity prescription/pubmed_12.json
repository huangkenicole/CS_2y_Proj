        "To evaluate whether physical activity on prescription, comprising five sessions, was more effective in increasing physical activity than a one-hour advice session after six months.",

        "Patients with clinically verified osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who undertook less than 150\u2009minute/week of moderate physical activity, and were aged 40-74\u2009years.",
        "The advice group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200969) received a one-hour session with individually tailored advice about physical activity. The physical activity on prescription group (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200972) received individually tailored physical activity recommendations with written prescription, and four follow-ups during six months.",
        "Patients were assessed at baseline and six months: physical activity (accelerometer, questionnaires); fitness (six-minute walk test, 30-second chair-stand test, maximal step-up test, one-leg rise test); pain after walking (VAS); symptoms (HOOS/KOOS); and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D).",
        "One hundred four patients had knee osteoarthritis, 102 were women, and mean age was 60.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3\u2009years. Pain after walking decreased significantly more in the prescription group, from VAS 31\u2009\u00b1\u200922 to 18\u2009\u00b1\u200923. There was no other between groups difference. Both groups increased self-reported activity minutes significantly, from 105 (95% CI 75-120) to 165 (95% CI 135-218) minute/week in the prescription group versus 75 (95% CI 75-105) to 150 (95% CI 120-225) in the advice group. Also symptoms and quality of life improved significantly in both groups.",
        "Individually tailored physical activity with written prescription and four follow-ups does not materially improve physical activity level more than advice about osteoarthritis and physical activity.",
