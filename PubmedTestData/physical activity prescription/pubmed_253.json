        "A substantial body of evidence supports the value of exercise in the treatment of people with depression. The guidelines for exercise prescription, however, are limited, and based on those developed for healthy populations. This article explores the evidence for exercise in the treatment of depression and the role mental health nurses may play in the delivery of this information. A model of exercise prescription is put forward based on the available evidence and taking into account the challenges faced by mental health nurses and people with depression."
