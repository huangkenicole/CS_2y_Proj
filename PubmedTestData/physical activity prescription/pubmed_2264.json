      "AbstractText": [
        "Asthma is a chronic lower respiratory disease that is very common worldwide, and its incidence is increasing year by year. Since the 1970s, asthma has become widespread, with approximately 300 million people affected worldwide and about 250,000 people have lost their lives. Asthma seriously affects people's physical and mental health, resulting in reduced learning efficiency, limited physical activities, and decreased quality of life. Therefore, raising awareness of the risk of asthma and how to effectively treat asthma have become important targets for the prevention and management of asthma in recent years. For patients with asthma, exercise training is a widely accepted adjunct to drug-based and non-pharmacological treatment. It has been recommended abroad that exercise prescriptions are an important part of asthma management."
