        "An epidemic of physical inactivity has given rise to a population struggling with early mortality and an increase in chronic non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Primary care providers as well as other clinicians are in a position to help overcome this epidemic of physical inactivity. The goal of this commentary is to provide clinicians with resources and recommendations from the recent literature to help overcome barriers to physical activity counseling and help patients become physically active. Theory-based interventions from communication and exercise prescriptions to wearables and mobile health technology are discussed. Limitations and future directions are explored."
