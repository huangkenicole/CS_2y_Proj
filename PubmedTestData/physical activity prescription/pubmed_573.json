        "This paper aims to evaluate the quality of clinical guidelines (CGs) for MS and to critically appraise physical activity-related recommendations.",
        "Medical databases (MEDLINE, TRIP), clearinghouses, and guideline developers. An expert was asked to confirm if the list of CGs was complete.",
        "Evidence-based CGs specific to MS with recommendations including aspects of rehabilitation or physical activity were included.",
        "Two reviewers independently first assessed the methodological quality of the CGs based on the 23 items of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument version two (AGREE II) and second evaluated the physical activity-related content quality using an instrument containing 14 items that was used for the development of the National Recommendations for Physical Activity in Germany.",
        "For the AGREE II domains and the criteria for content quality, standardized domain scores were calculated.",
        "Three CGs were included. The average scores for the methodological quality of the domains were: scope and purpose (91%), stakeholder involvement (81%), rigor of development (78%), clarity of presentation (93%), applicability (53%), and editorial independence (83%). The mean scores for physical activity-related content quality did not exceed 56% for any criteria.",
        "Overall, this critical review shows that the methodological quality of CGs were moderate to good but physical activity-related content quality was heterogeneous and low. Results emphasize the need for more specific physical activity recommendations that incorporate multiple aspects of physical activity prescription."
