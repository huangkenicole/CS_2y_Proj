        "Prescription of orthoses and assistive devices that facilitate physical function is a major component of the rehabilitation process in spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "To evaluate the long-term use of orthoses prescribed during inpatient rehabilitation in people with SCI and investigate the factors related to discarding the device.",
        "Medical records of 202 SCI patients who were included in an inpatient rehabilitation program of a tertiary research hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Patients' demographic data, neurological level of spinal cord injury functional state and use of assistive devices for ambulation (orthoses, walkers, etc.) at discharge were recorded. At follow-up, study participants were contacted by telephone and queried regarding the frequency and duration of use of orthoses; if the individual had discontinued using the orthoses, the reasons for discarding the device were sought.",
        "The majority of the study participants (62.7%) had been prescribed a knee-ankle-foot orthosis during their inpatient stay. At follow-up, the regular use of orthoses was ongoing in 67.6% of the participants, and nonuse was determined in 32.4%. The most common cited reasons for discarding the device were difficulty in donning and doffing, functional improvement, and mechanical problems of the orthoses.",
        "A significant number of patients had discarded their orthoses at the long-term follow-up and the main reasons for discarding the devices were orthotic factors. Timely reevaluation of the patient and orthosis modification according to patients' needs is necessary to achieve long-term compliance."
