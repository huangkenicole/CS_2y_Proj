        "This study compared the effectiveness of Leuko and Nessa Ankle braces in restricting inversion before, during and after exercise. Thirteen Australian Rules Footballers with a mean age of 23.7 years (range = 17-30), and who had no previous history of moderate to severe ankle sprains, were tested in this study. A pedal goniometer was used to measure active inversion with the ankle in 42 degrees plantarflexion. Measurements were taken prior to the application of the brace, immediately after the brace was applied, after 20 minutes of controlled activity involving running, side-stepping and jumping, and after a further 20 minutes of identical drills. A study design in which all subjects were required to wear each brace once was used. Analysis revealed no significant difference in ankle inversion between braces at any of the measurement times (p > 0.05). Both the Nessa and Leuko Ankle brace significantly restricted inversion immediately after the brace was applied, after 20 and 40 minutes of exercise. The results provide objective guidelines for the prescription of ankle braces in the prevention of ankle injuries during physical activity."
