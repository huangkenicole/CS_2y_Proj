        "Exercise testing can provide valuable information to aid the primary care physician in developing a safe and effective exercise program for his or her patients. This review presents the most recent recommendations for the components of an exercise program as well as methods to accomplish appropriate prescription writing for the various subsets of individuals from the healthy patient to the patient with chronic disease. In addition, a plea is made for physicians to encourage all patients to engage in at least some kind of regular exercise activity in an attempt to counteract the increasingly sedentary lifestyles found in our culture."
