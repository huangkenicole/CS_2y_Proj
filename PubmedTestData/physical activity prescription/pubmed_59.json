        "Despite the extensive evidence supporting physical activity (PA) for managing chronic low back pain (CLBP), little is known about PA prescription by physical therapists treating patients with CLBP.",
        "1) Explore how PA prescriptions provided by outpatient physical therapists treating patients with CLBP align with PA guidelines. 2) Examine the barriers and facilitators of PA prescription among physical therapists working with patients with CLBP.",
        "We conducted a qualitative study with outpatient physical therapists who treat CLBP. Semi-structured interviews provided an understanding of physical therapist experience with PA prescription among patients with CLBP. The interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically.",
        "The 18 participants had an average of 13.4 (6.4) years of clinical experience in outpatient physical therapy. Thematic analysis revealed: 1) Physical therapists' articulate knowledge of PA guidelines and importance of physical activity; 2) Patient factors take priority over the PA guidelines for people with CLBP; and 3) The importance of building and maintaining a strong patient-therapist relationship influences physical therapist prescription of PA for patients with CLBP.",
        "When providing PA recommendations for patients with CLBP, general movement recommendations are emphasized in place of explicit PA prescriptions. Our findings highlight factors for consideration when prescribing movement and PA for patients with CLBP."
