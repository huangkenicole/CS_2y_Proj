        "\u3000Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a critical disease in the aging population. Conventional therapy in hospitals cannot cure elderly patients with CHF at the end of life. Patients and their families experience anxiety and need comfortable care at home or in a nursing facility. To improve chronic cardiovascular disease management, we developed a simplified but integrated clinical pathway to facilitate medical and nursing care teamwork in the local community. Our institution is a central hospital in the North Shinshu district, which has an approximate population of 100000. We developed a pathway for both clinical program and information provision between our hospital and neighboring clinics. A hospital team evaluates and shares patient information with a homecare medical team every 6 months using the medical staff pathway. To maintain the efficacy and security of pharmacotherapy, a hospital clinical pharmacist reviews the prescriptions and prepares a drug profile book to share drug information between patients and all medical staff. These efforts have resulted in preventing adverse effects of drugs and reduced the cost of medications. Physical activity evaluation and nutrient guidance are also useful for patients to maintain their personal lifestyles. We initiated use of the pathway from 2009 and have followed up over 500 patients since then. We have also established a community partnership council to promote face-to-face communication among multiple categories of institutions and government agencies. Members of the council collaborate to help patients with cardiovascular disease to manage their own lives at home."
