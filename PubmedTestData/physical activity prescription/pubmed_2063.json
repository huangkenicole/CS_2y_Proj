      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of this study was to examine the associations between linear sprint, curve sprint (CS), change of direction (COD) speed, and jump performance in a sample of 17 professional female soccer players. All athletes performed squat and countermovement jumps, single leg horizontal triple jumps, 17 m linear sprints, CS tests, and a 17 m Zigzag COD test. A Pearson product-moment test was performed to determine the relationships among the assessed variables. The significance level was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. Nearly perfect associations (<i>r</i> > 0.9) were found between linear and CS velocities. Players faster in linear sprints and CS exhibited greater COD deficits. No significant associations were found between COD deficit and either body mass or sprint momentum. Jumping ability was significantly correlated with linear sprint and CS performance, but not to COD performance. These findings may be used by coaches and practitioners to guide testing and training prescriptions in this population. The associations observed here suggest that training methods designed to improve linear sprint and CS velocities may benefit from the implementation of vertically and horizontally oriented plyometric exercises."
