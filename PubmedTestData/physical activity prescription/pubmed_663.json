        "The Exercise is Medicine\u00ae Canada on Campus (EIMC-OC) program aims to integrate exercise prescription into healthcare and encourage students to implement physical activity initiatives on campus. However, multi-site interventions like EIMC-OC are often challenged with communicating and sharing strategies across geographically dispersed groups. The EIMC-OC Casebook was created as an accessible method to enhance program success by sharing ideas and implementation strategies between groups, but its potential utility is unknown as few studies have evaluated casebooks. This study evaluated the usability and value of the EIMC-OC Casebook for promoting physical activity and established end-users' insight on Casebook future directions. The Casebook was shared and semi-structured interviews were conducted with established and developing EIMC-OC groups. Five themes discussing the usability, value, and future directions of the Casebook were identified. Participants implemented the Casebook to varying degrees, found it to be a valuable communication medium, and recommended revisions, which may enhance its implementation. The EIMC-OC Casebook is a valuable tool that exemplifies campus-based efforts to promote physical activity, augments between-group communication, and helps groups conduct effective initiatives. Program leaders and researchers may benefit from a similar Casebook approach, and recommendations are provided to evaluators aiming to enhance the effectiveness of multi-site programs."
