        "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of endurance training individually guided by objective (Heart Rate Variability-HRV) or self-report measure of stress (DALDA-questionnaire) in comparison to predefined endurance training prescription for improving endurance performance in recreational runners. After a 2-week preliminary baseline period to establish resting HRV and self-reported measure of stress, thirty-six male recreational runners were randomly assigned to HRV-guided (G<sub>HRV;</sub> <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200912), DALDA-guided (G<sub>D</sub>; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200912) or predefined training (G<sub>T</sub>; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200912) prescription groups. Before and after 5-weeks of endurance training, participants performed a track field peak velocity (V<sub>peak_TF</sub>), time limit (T<sub>lim</sub>) at 100% of V<sub>peak_TF</sub> and 5\u2009km time-trial (5\u2009km TT) tests. G<sub>D</sub> lead to higher improvements in V<sub>peak_TF</sub> (8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8%; ES\u2009=\u20091.41) and 5\u2009km TT (-12.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2%; ES\u2009=\u2009-1.97), than G<sub>HRV</sub> (6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5% and -8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8%; ES\u2009=\u2009-1.20; 1.24) and G<sub>T</sub> (4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5% and -6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3%; ES\u2009=\u2009-0.82; 0.68), respectively, with no differences for T<sub>lim</sub>. Self-report measures of stress may be used to individualize endurance training prescription on a daily basis leading to better performance enhancement, which may be used with HRV for a holistic understanding of daily training-induce adaptations."
