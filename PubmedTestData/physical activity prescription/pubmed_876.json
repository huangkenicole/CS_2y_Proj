        "The purpose of this investigation was to identify the influence that sex, training intensity, and frequency have on long-term resistance exercise (RE) outcomes in older adults.",
        "One-hundred eleven older adults (men: 41, women: 70) completed either: high-intensity RE 2d/week (HI-2D; n\u00a0=\u00a029), low-intensity RE 2d/week (LI-2D; n\u00a0=\u00a032), high-intensity RE 3d/week (HI-3D, n\u00a0=\u00a020), or low-intensity RE 3d/week (LI-3D, n\u00a0=\u00a030). HI protocols completed 3 sets of 8 repetitions with 80% one-repetition maximum (1-RM) while LI completed 3 sets of 16 repetitions with 40% 1-RM. Total and regional bone free lean body mass (BFLBM) were assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the rectus femoris.",
        "mCSA was the only muscle quantity parameter to increase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Significant trial effects for upper body, lower body, and specific strength were observed (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Significant sex \u00d7 time interactions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were observed for upper and lower body strength, however, men and women displayed similar increases in lower body (45.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.6 vs 46.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.9%), upper body (33.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.0 vs 33.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.7%), and specific strength (36.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.5 vs 40.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.7%). A group \u00d7 time interaction for lower body strength indicated that at 20-weeks HI-2D and LI-3D displayed greater lower body strength than LI-2D (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.009), and at 40-weeks HI-2D, HI-3D, and LI-3D displayed significantly greater lower body strength than LI-2D (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.038).",
        "These observations indicate that older men and women display similar long-term RE outcomes. Additionally, regardless of frequency or intensity, the current prescriptions were effective for increasing strength, however these data suggest HI-2D\u00a0>\u00a0LI-2D and LI-3D\u00a0>\u00a0LI-2D but similar outcomes among HI-2D, HI-3D, and LI-3D. The variety of effective RE approaches provides flexibility among older adults for selecting a lifestyle intervention that would be most sustainable."
