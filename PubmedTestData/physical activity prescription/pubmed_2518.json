        "We wanted to look at the way opioid pain drugs are provided to mothers after the birth of their children and see what doctors tell mothers about the pain drugs. We interviewed doctors and asked which opioid pain drug they would choose, what made them prescribe the drug, the thoughts about giving mothers the drug and what they told the mothers about the drug. We then looked at all the responses to look for patterns in how doctors gave pain drugs to mothers. Our team interviewed 38 doctors. Some key points were seen; first is that the choice of opioid pain drug, dose and number of pills prescribed was different from doctor to doctor; second is that whether the baby was delivered vaginally or by cesarean was the main factor upon which doctors based their decisions for giving opioid pain drugs. Whether a mother was taking medications that help with addiction, the doctor\u2019s assessment of the mother\u2019s pain and the doctor\u2019s thoughts on the mother\u2019s risk of opioid addiction were also considered. All doctors would give opioid pain drugs to breastfeeding mothers. Finally, some doctors talked to mothers about using other medications for pain, but not about the overuse of opioid pain drugs. At our two hospital centers in Pennsylvania, the 38 doctors gave opioid pain drugs to mothers in 38 different ways. Doctors said that opioids are necessary after cesarean, but not after vaginal birth, unless there is a problem. A mother\u2019s history and social situation inform decision making. Doctors talk to mothers about short-term pain, but not about the overuse of opioid pain drugs."

        "<b>Aim:</b> To examine postpartum opioid prescribing practices. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Obstetricians were interviewed about opioids: choice of opioid, clinical factors considered when prescribing, thoughts/beliefs about prescribing, and typical counseling provided. Inductive thematic analyses were used to identify themes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 38 interviews were analyzed. Several key points emerged. The choice of opioid, dosing and number of pills prescribed varied widely. The mode of delivery is the primary consideration for prescribing opioids. All providers would prescribe opioids to breastfeeding women. Some providers offered counseling on nonopioid treatment of pain. <b>Discussion:</b> At two large tertiary centers in Pennsylvania, the 38 physicians interviewed wrote 38 unique opioid prescriptions. Patient counseling addressed short-term pain management, but not the chronic overuse of opioids."
