      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aims to analyze the agreement of cardiopulmonary variables between a cardiopulmonary exercise test with elastic resistance (CPxEL) and high-intensity interval exercise with elastic resistance (EL-HIIE).",
        "Twenty-two physically independent participants were recruited. Visit one consisted of conducting a health survey and anthropometric assessment. On visit two, the participants performed CPxEL. After seven days, on visit three, the participants performed EL-HIIE. The CPxEL was carried out on a rubber mat demarcated by lines representing eight stages. The test consisted of alternating back and forth steps against elastic resistance. The increments were performed at a rate of one stage per minute, following a cadence controlled by a metronome calibrated by beats per minute (bpm). The EL-HIIE was performed at the stage corresponding to an intensity of ~85% VO<sub>2max</sub>, as determined by CPxEL. The EL-HIIE consisted of 10 \u00d7 1 min (work):1 min (passive rest), with a cadence of 200 bpm. Cardiopulmonary parameters, heart rate (HR), and oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) were measured during exercise. Bland-Altman was applied to analyze the agreement between the HR and VO<sub>2</sub> found in EL-HIIE and the values prescribed by CPxEL (~85-90% VO<sub>2max</sub>).",
        "The HRpeak and VO<sub>2</sub>peak in the EL-HIIE showed good agreement with the VO<sub>2CPxEL</sub> and HR<sub>CPxEL</sub> values, showing an average difference of (-1.7 mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) and (0.3 bpm).",
        "The results of the present study demonstrate the agreement of cardiopulmonary variables between the CPxEL and the EL-HIIE. Therefore, for a more specific prescription of EL-HIIE intensity, CPxEL can be used."
