        "To discover what use adolescents make of the medical services in a Health Area and why they attend.",

        "Between July 1992 and June 1993, 717 clinical records selected by means of systematic sampling out of 2127 records of 14 to 18 year old adolescents were examined.",
        "Frequency of attendance was 2.15 per adolescent per year, with a standard error of 0.096. Significantly less males than females attended (p < 0.05). 66.53% attended at least once a year. The CIPSAP-2 groups most commonly found were: Respiratory System diseases (433 attendances), Supplementary Classification (231) and Dermatological diseases (177). We found a significantly higher attendance (p < 0.05) in males in the groups for Endocrino-metabolic illnesses and injuries/side-effects, and in females (p < 0.05) in illnesses of the Locomotive System. The commonest individual reasons for attendance were: Respiratory Infection of the upper passages, Prescriptions/Forms/Letters, Tonsillitis and Acne.",
        "Adolescents use the health services less than the rest of the population. Out of the pathologies giving rise to their attendance, the problems arising from the physiological changes and physical activity inherent to this age-group have great specific weight. However such important problems as those arising from so-called \"life-style risks\" do not appear to be common causes of adolescents seeking health care. We conclude with the need to devote greater and better Primary Health Care to this age-group in order to tackle this situation."
