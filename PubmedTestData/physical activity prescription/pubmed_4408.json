        "Regular exercise has been shown to have a beneficial effect on primary osteoporosis (POP). However, current exercise prescriptions have limitations such as insufficient individualized features and low participant compliance, which in turn limit their application in clinical practice. In this study, we propose to establish a personalized exercise prescription based on the Chinese traditional exercise-Yi Jin Jing, combined with treadmill exercises and strength training, and then observe its effects on pain, muscle strength, balance, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolic indexes in patients with POP.",
        "This trial is a single-center, randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled clinical study. We will recruit 40 patients with POP and assign them to the control group and the experimental group in a 1:1 ratio according to the intended protocol. The control group received 24 weeks of conventional medication and health promotion, and the experimental group received 24 weeks of personalized exercise prescription intervention (Yijinjing, treadmill exercises, and strength training). Outcome measures include pain (visual analogue scale), muscle strength (bilateral upper limb grip strength and isometric muscle strength of the trunk, hip, and knee), balance (Balance test with eyes open and closed while standing on one leg), and BMD (Lumbar spine 2-4 and femoral neck). In addition, bone metabolism indicators include parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH) 2D3), type I procollagen aminoterminal peptide and type I collagen carboxy-terminal peptide. Outcome measures will be assessed before and after 24 weeks of intervention. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS22.0.",
        "This trial aimed to enrich the content and form of exercise rehabilitation prescriptions for patients with POP, which is conducive to improving the exercise rehabilitation effect and quality of life in this population."
