        "Inactive lifestyles are a key risk factor underpinning the development of many chronic diseases, yet more than half of the Italian population does not meet WHO thresholds for at least moderate physical activity. This study aims to make the economic case to upscale investments in policy actions to promote exercise and physical activity.",
        "Modelling-based cost-effectiveness analysis in Italy.",
        "The study assesses the impact on health and healthcare expenditure of seven public health policies to promote exercise and physical activity against a business as usual scenario. Assessed policies include: promotion of active transport, workplace sedentarily interventions, investments in sports and recreation, mass media campaigns, prescription of physical activity in primary care, school-based interventions and mobile apps.",
        "Public policies to promote exercise have the potential to improve population health and produce savings in healthcare expenditure. Assessed policies can avoid hundreds of cases of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes per year and tens of cases of cancer resulting in gains in DALYs in the order of thousands per year. In the medium-term, the vast majority of policies show excellent cost-effectiveness ratio, below internationally recognized thresholds.",
        "Investing in policies to promote active lifestyles is a good investment for Italy."
