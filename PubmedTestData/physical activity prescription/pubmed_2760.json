        "To compare the short-term effect of power- and strength-oriented resistance-training programs on the individualized load-velocity profiles obtained during the squat (SQ) and bench-press (BP) exercises.",
        "Thirty physically active men (age = 23.4\u00a0[3.5]\u00a0y; SQ 1-repetition maximum [1RM] = 126.5 [26.7]\u00a0kg; BP 1RM = 81.6 [16.7]\u00a0kg) were randomly assigned to a power- (exercises: countermovement jump and BP throw; sets per exercise: 4-6; repetitions per set: 5-6; load: 40% 1RM) or strength-training group (exercises: SQ and BP; sets per exercise: 4-6; repetitions per set: 2-8; load: 70%-90% 1RM). The training program lasted 4 wk (2\u00a0sessions/wk). The individualized load-velocity profiles (ie,\u00a0velocity associated with the 30%-60%-90% 1RM) were assessed before and after training through an incremental loading test during the SQ and BP exercises.",
        "The power-training group moderately increased the velocity associated with the full spectrum of % 1RM for the SQ (effect size [ES] range: 0.70 to 0.93) and with the 30% 1RM for the BP (ES: 0.67), while the strength-training group reported trivial/small changes across the load-velocity spectrum for both the SQ (ES range: 0.00 to 0.35) and BP (ES range: -0.06 to -0.33). The power-training group showed a higher increase in the mean velocity associated with all % 1RM compared with the strength-training group for both the SQ (ES range: 0.54 to 0.63) and BP (ES range: 0.25 to 0.53).",
        "The individualized load-velocity profile (ie,\u00a0velocity associated with different % 1RM) of lower-body and upper-body exercises can be modified after a 4-wk resistance-training program."
