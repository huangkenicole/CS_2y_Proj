        "Feelings of effort sense quantified via the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale have been validated for regulating exercise intensity. Most studies validating RPE for exercise prescription have used young, male subjects and only a few exercise sessions. As part of a larger study we examined the accuracy of RPE for regulating exercise intensity in a group of postmenopausal women. Six women (70.0+/-7.1 yr.) were given a maximal graded exercise test. Target RPEs equivalent to 40%, 50% and 60% VO2 max were developed from this test using standard techniques. These RPEs were used to regulate intensity during a 20-wk. training program. During the initial 5 wk. of training target intensity was increased from 40% to 60% VO2 max and exercise duration from 15 to 30 min. Accuracy of exercise intensity regulation was determined by comparing the heart rate during exercise to a target heart rate equivalent to the desired %VO2 max. At Week 2 of training (target 40% VO2 max) the mean intensity produced did not differ from target. During Weeks 4 (target 50% VO2 max), 6 and 10 of training (target 60% VO2 max) the mean exercise intensity was below target. At Week 20 the mean intensity produced was not different from target. This suggests that elderly women can accurately use RPE to regulate exercise intensity, but at intensities above 40% VO2 max an acclimation period is needed."
