        "Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI; e.g., disrupted memory, executive functioning, and information processing) affects many young adults, causing significant distress, reducing quality of life (QoL), and thwarting their ability to engage in professional, recreational, and social experiences. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to investigate young adults' lived experiences with CRCI, and any strategies (including physical activity) they use to self-manage this burdensome side effect. Sixteen young adults (M<sub>age</sub> = 30.8 \u00b1 6.0 years; 87.5% female; M<sub>years since diagnosis</sub> = 3.2 \u00b1 3) who reported clinically meaningful CRCI whilst completing an online survey were interviewed virtually. Four themes comprising 13 sub-themes were identified through an inductive thematic analysis: (1) <i>descriptions and interpretations of the CRCI phenomenon</i>, (2) <i>effects of CRCI on day-to-day and QoL</i>, (3) <i>cognitive-behavioural self-management strategies</i>, and (4) <i>recommendations for improving care</i>. Findings suggest CRCI is detrimental to young adults' QoL and must be addressed more systematically in practice. Results also illuminate the promise of PA in coping with CRCI, but research is needed to confirm this association, test how and why this may occur, and determine optimal PA prescriptions for young adults to self-manage their CRCI."
