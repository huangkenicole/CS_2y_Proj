      "AbstractText": [
        "Treatment of arteriopathy of the lower limbs (ALL) with vasoactive drugs must follow French health laws recently introduced in regard to the prescription of unuseful drugs and treatments and the frequency at which some patients resort to specific drugs and treatments. Prescription of vasoactive drugs in ALL requires the existence of functional discomfort. Prescription of only one vasoactive drug is sufficient.",
        "Results of published clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of vasoactive drugs for the relief of claudication related to arteriopathy. To conform to the rules of the European Drug Agency, treatment with vasoactive drugs which improve the walking distance is recommended as \"symptomatic treatment of arterial claudication in ALL\". Iloprost is only used in the treatment of permanent ischemia. Prescription of vasoactive drugs is part of a scheme of therapeutic indications that are well known and rigorous. Rules of hygiene and reduction of risk factors are the essential preliminary elements. In the case of arterial claudication due to femoral or distal obliteration, chemical medication is suggested, whereas in the case of iliac lesion, angioplasty should be considered.",
        "Walking is recommended in all the cases; however, usually less than a quarter of all patients will conform to this recommendation. Vasoactive drugs thus find their place in the therapeutic scheme. Evaluation of the efficiency of vasoactive drugs rises above simple measures of the walking distance, rather integrating quality of life and usefulness of the treatment."
