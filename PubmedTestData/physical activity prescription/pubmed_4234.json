        "Inactivity leads to frailty and loss of function for older adults. Most older adults are sedentary. Participating in a regular routine of physical activity is recommended for maintaining physical function required to sustain quality of life and independence for older adults. Annual screening for level of physical activity is required to determine changes from year to year. Research shows older adults are more likely to initiate a regular routine of physical activity when a health care provider writes a prescription for physical activity including the type, frequency, and specific duration of physical activity sessions."
