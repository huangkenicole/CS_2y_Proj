        "The aim of this study was to investigate the physical determinants of weightlifting competition performance based on Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP) and Countermovement Jump (CMJ) force-time variables, in a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Ten British advanced international female weightlifters' competition results and neuromuscular assessment data collected as part of the British Weight Lifting World Class Programme were utilised for the purpose of this study. All data were averaged for two consecutive 1-year periods. The cross-sectional analysis utilised the second year of data, whereas the longitudinal analysis assessed the mean change between the two years. The cross-sectional analysis results reveal IMTP Net Isometric Peak Force (PF) and CMJ Peak Power (PP) predict 94.2%, 95.1% and 91.8% of the variance in Total, Snatch and Clean & Jerk competition performance, respectively (<i>p</i> =\u00a0<0.5). The longitudinal analysis results revealed that \u2206IMTP PF was the only predicting factor of longitudinal change in weightlifting competition performance predicting 41.5%, 41.7% and 42.5% of \u2206Total, \u2206Snatch and \u2206Clean & Jerk, respectively (<i>p</i> =\u00a0<0.5). The assessments and equations may be utilised by coaches or sports scientists to inform the prescription of training and help predict competition performance."
