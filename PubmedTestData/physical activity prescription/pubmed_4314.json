        "Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly prescribed to provide ankle support during walking. Current prescription standards provide general guidelines for choosing between AFO types, but are limited in terms of guiding specific design parameter choices. These design parameters affect the ankle stiffness of the AFO.",
        "The aim of this review was to investigate the impact of AFO stiffness on walking mechanics.",
        "A literature search was conducted using three databases: Pubmed, Engineering Village, and Web of Science.",
        "After applying the exclusion criteria, 25 of 287 potential articles were included. The included papers tested a range of stiffnesses (0.02-8.17\u202fNm/deg), a variety of populations (e.g. healthy, post-stroke, cerebral palsy) and various gait outcome measures. Ankle kinematics were the most frequently reported measures and the most consistently affected by stiffness variations. Greater stiffnesses generally resulted in reduced peak ankle plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, and total range of motion, as well as increased dorsiflexion at initial contact. At the knee, a few studies reported increased flexion at initial contact, and decreased peak extension and increased peak flexion during stance when stiffness was increased. Stiffness did not affect hip kinetics and there was low evidence for its effects on hip or pelvis kinematics, ankle and knee kinetics, muscle activity, metabolic cost, ground reaction forces and spatiotemporal parameters. There were no generalizable trends for the impact of stiffness on user preference.",
        "AFO stiffness is a key factor influencing ankle movement. Clear reporting standards for AFO design parameters, as well as additional high quality research is needed with larger sample sizes and different clinical populations to ascertain the true effect of stiffness on gait."
