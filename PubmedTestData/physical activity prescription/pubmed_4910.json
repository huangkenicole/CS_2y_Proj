        "This study provides the most detailed empirical examination of the naturopathic profession and naturopathic practice in Australia.",
        "Naturopaths from the Practitioner Research And Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) were invited to participate in an online workforce survey.",
        "The baseline survey was completed by 281 naturopaths and 155 (55.2%) completed the second survey. Respondents were predominantly female (86.7%), with a mean age of 45.5 years (SD 10.4). A diverse range of clinical interest topics were disclosed; most frequent were digestive (84.0%) and women's (79.4%) health. Diet/nutrition (91.1%), sleep (90.2%), stress management (85.3%) and physical activity/fitness (79.4%) were commonly discussed during consultation.",
        "Although respondents reported a varied scope of practice, there was a notable emphasis on lifestyle prescriptions. Given lifestyle diseases are the leading cause of death in Australia, a more in-depth examination of the preparedness of the naturopathy workforce to integrate into community-based health care teams is now warranted."
