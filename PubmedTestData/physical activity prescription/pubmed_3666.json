      "AbstractText": [
        "Resistance exercise is used as a non-pharmacological tool to elicit both gains in and maintenance of physical function in the elderly. Thus, the present study examined the acute response of creatine kinase and interleukin-6 following an eccentric resistance exercise session in elderly obese women classified as high responders or normal responders.",
        "Cross-sectional field study.",
        "Ninety elderly obese women (69.4 \u00b1 6.01 years) were tested for a 10 repetition maximum on the leg extension exercise and then completed an acute eccentric resistance exercise session consisting of seven sets of 10 repetitions at 110% of 10 repetition maximum with a rest of 3 min between sets. Subjects were divided into normal response or high response on the basis of the peak serum interleukin-6 (NR = 59 and HR = 7) and creatine kinase (NR = 81 and HR = 9) concentration being greater than (HR) or less than (NR) the 90th percentile.",
        "Creatine kinase was higher at 0 h, 3h, 24h and 48 h following the ERE for the HR group. The peak creatine kinase was significantly higher in HR group versus the normal response group. The average increase in the serum interleukin-6 \u0394 for the HR group (\u223c 850%) was significantly higher versus the normal response group (\u223c 55%). Serum interleukin-6 was significantly higher at 0 h and 24h following eccentric resistance exercise only for the high response group, while peak levels were significantly higher in high response group versus the normal response group (p \u2264 0.005). Only one subject met the criteria to be classified as high response for both creatine kinase and interleukin-6 responsiveness.",
        "Elderly individuals classified as high response experienced greater creatine kinase and interleukin-6 responses to ERE. Thus, a prudent approach for eccentric resistance exercise prescription might be programming additional recovery days and/or lower intensity training, especially in the beginning stages of a program."
