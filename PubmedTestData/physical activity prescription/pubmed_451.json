        "Promoting health by sport has now gone one step further. Integrated into the 2015 Health Act, medical prescription of sport activities is organized locally, as illustrated by the Strasbourg \u201csport-health prescription\u201d programme, which promotes physical activity for patients with stable chronic diseases within local sports structures. Observation of the real functioning of this programme, based on the practices and descriptions of six sports educators in various structures, reveals demedicalisation in favour of sportification, as sports educators translate the prescription according to their specific institution and policies. Although there is a general consensus about the need for physical education to fight against inactivity and isolation of patients, the expected effects of physical activity are redefined according to a political economy of local structures. Implementation of the sport-health programme is subject to the social and political conditions of the local sports movement."
