      "AbstractText": [
        "Over the past 2 decades, fundamentals of exercise medicine, including clinical exercise testing, assessment and promotion of physical activity, exercise prescription, and supervised exercise training/rehabilitation programming have demonstrated considerable clinical value in the management of children and adolescents with congenital and acquired heart disease. Although the principles of exercise medicine have become an integral component in pediatric cardiology, there are no standardized training recommendations for exercise physiology during pediatric cardiology fellowship at this time. Thus, the Pediatric Cardiology Exercise Medicine Curriculum Committee (PCEMCC) was formed to establish core and advanced exercise physiology training recommendations for pediatric cardiology trainees. The PCEMCC includes a diverse group of pediatric cardiologists, exercise physiologists, and fellowship program directors. The expert consensus training recommendations are by no means a mandate and are summarized herein, including suggestions for achieving the minimum knowledge and training needed for general pediatric cardiology practice."
