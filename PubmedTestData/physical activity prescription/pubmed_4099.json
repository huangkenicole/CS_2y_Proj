        "The foot provides an important source of afferent feedback for balance and locomotion. Sensory feedback from the feet can be altered by standing or walking on different surfaces. The purpose was to determine the effects of textured footwear on lower extremity muscle activity, limb kinematics, and joint kinetics while walking. Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics, as well as muscle EMG, were collected as subjects walked with a smooth and textured shoe insert. Muscle activity was analyzed using a wavelet technique. The textured shoe insert caused a significant reduction in both soleus and tibialis anterior intensity during periods when these muscles are most active. Furthermore, the changes in muscle activity were only seen in the low frequency content of the EMG signal. The foot was significantly more plantar flexed at heel strike with the textured inserts. Small changes were also seen in vertical ground reaction forces and joint moments. It was assumed that the changes in gait patterns were due to a change in sensory feedback caused by the textured shoe insert. The possibilities of altered sensory feedback with footwear are discussed. Sensory feedback from the feet may affect specific motor unit pools during different activities. Changing the texture, without changing the geometry, of a shoe insert can alter muscle activity during walking. This may be useful in the prescription of footwear interventions and suggests that footwear may have sensory as well as mechanical effects."
