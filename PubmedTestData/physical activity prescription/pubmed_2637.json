        "To determine the level of neck strength decrement and the rate of strength recovery of the neck muscles after a single bout of specific neck conditioning exercise in both males and females.",
        "A decrement in neck strength may be evident after a bout of strengthening exercise.",
        "Intervention study with pre-and-post design.",
        "Biomechanics laboratory.",
        "Twenty healthy participants (10 male and 10 female, mean +/- standard deviation age 22 +/- 1.2 years).",
        "Participants performed a single bout of neck strengthening exercise. Neck strength testing using an isokinetic dynamometer was performed pre and at five time points (1 h, one, three, five and seven days) post-exercise to assess the level of neck strength decrement and neck strength recovery rate from pre-exercise levels.",
        "Statistically significant (p > or = 0.036) decreases in neck extension strength were recorded in all participants 1 h and one day post-exercise. The level of neck extension strength returned to pre-exercise levels three days post-exercise and surpassed pre-exercise levels five and seven days post-exercise. The male participants' neck flexion strength decrement and recovery followed a similar pattern to that displayed in neck extension but more variability in neck flexion strength recovery rates were recorded in the female participants in this study.",
        "The consistent strength recovery times for the male participants recorded in this study idealise the prescription of neck strengthening exercises in a periodised fashion. More investigation needs to be instigated for the female neck musculature as consistent strength recovery rates were not identified in this study."
