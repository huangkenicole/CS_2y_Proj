        "The aim was to evaluate whether neck-specific exercise, with (NSEB) or without (NSE) a behavioural approach, improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to physical activity prescription (PPA) in chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) grades 2 and 3. A secondary aim was to identify factors associated with HRQoL and HRQoL improvement following exercise interventions.",
        "This is a secondary analysis of a multicentre randomized clinical trial. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009216) with chronic WAD grades 2 and 3 were randomized to 12\u00a0weeks of PPA or physiotherapist-led NSE or NSEB. The EQ-5D 3L/EQ-VAS and SF-36v2 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summaries were collected together with several neck-related and psychosocial outcomes at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months, and were analysed with linear mixed models (all time points) and multivariate linear regressions (baseline, 6\u00a0months).",
        "NSE/NSEB resulted in better outcomes than PPA (EQ-VAS and SF-36 PCS, both groups, p\u2009<\u20090.01) but not in a higher EQ-5D score. Improvement over time was seen in EQ-5D/EQ-VAS for the NSEB group (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and for NSE/NSEB as measured with the PCS (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Factors associated with baseline HRQoL and change to 6\u00a0months in HRQoL (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.38-0.59) were both neck-related and psychosocial (e.g. depression, work ability).",
        "Neck-specific exercise, particularly with a behavioural approach, may have a more positive impact on HRQoL than physical activity prescription in chronic WAD grades 2 and 3. HRQoL is however complex, and other factors also need to be considered. Factors associated with HRQL and improvements in HRQoL following exercise are multidimensional.",
