        "Despite knowledge of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) training responders and nonresponders, it is not well understood how the exercise intensity prescription affects the incidence of response. The purpose of this study was to determine CRF training responsiveness based on cohort-specific technical error after 12 wk of standardized or individually prescribed exercise and the use of a verification protocol to confirm maximal oxygen uptake (V\u02d9O2max).",
        "Sedentary adult participants (9 men, 30 women; 48.2 \u00b1 12.2 yr) completed exercise training on 3 d\u00b7wk for 12 wk, with exercise intensity prescribed based on standardized methods using heart rate reserve or an individualized approach using ventilatory thresholds. A verification protocol was used at baseline and 12 wk to confirm the identification of a true V\u02d9O2max and subsequent relative percent changes to quantify CRF training responsiveness. A cohort-specific technical error (4.7%) was used as a threshold to identify incidence of response.",
        "Relative V\u02d9O2max significantly increased (P < 0.05) from 24.3 \u00b1 4.6 to 26.0 \u00b1 4.2 and 29.2 \u00b1 7.5 to 32.8 \u00b1 8.6 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min for the standardized and individualized groups, respectively. Absolute V\u02d9O2max significantly increased (P < 0.05) from 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 to 2.2 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.8 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.9 L\u00b7min for the standardized and individualized groups, respectively. A significant difference in responsiveness was found between the individualized and standardized groups with 100% and 60% of participants categorized as responders, respectively.",
        "A threshold model for exercise intensity prescription had a greater effect on the incidence of CRF training response compared with a standardized approach using heart rate reserve. The use of thresholds for intensity markers accounts for individual metabolic characteristics and should be considered as a viable and practical method to prescribe exercise intensity."
