        "This study investigates the effects of exercise training on exerkines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to determine the optimal exercise prescription.",
        "A systematic search for relevant studies was performed in 3 databases. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of exercise training on at least one of the following exerkines were included: adiponectin, apelin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor-21, follistatin, ghrelin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, leptin, myostatin, omentin, resistin, retinol-binding protein 4, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and visfatin.",
        "Forty randomized controlled trials were selected for data extraction (n\u202f=\u202f2160). Exercise training induces changes in adiponectin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor-21, IL-6, IL-10, leptin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels but has no significant effects on apelin, IL-18, and ghrelin compared to controls. Physical exercise training favored large and positive changes in pooled exerkines (i.e., an overall effect size calculated from several exerkines) (Hedge's g\u202f=\u202f1.02, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.76-1.28), which in turn were related to changes in glycated hemoglobin (mean difference (MD)\u202f=\u202f-0.81%, 95%CI: -0.95% to -0.67%), fasting glucose (MD\u202f=\u202f-23.43 mg/dL, 95%CI: -30.07 mg/dL to -16.80 mg/dL), waist circumference (MD\u202f=\u202f-3.04 cm, 95%CI: -4.02 cm to -2.07 cm), and body mass (MD\u202f=\u202f-1.93 kg, 95%CI: -2.00 kg to -1.86 kg). Slightly stronger effects were observed with aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval protocols at moderate- to vigorous-intensity and with programs longer than 24 weeks that comprise at least 3 sessions per week and more than 60 min per session.",
