        "Treatments of lymphoma can lead to reduced physical functioning, cancer-related fatigue, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. These side effects can negatively impact the cancer survivor's quality of life. Mounting evidence indicates that physical activities are highly therapeutic in mitigating the short- and long-term side effects of cancer treatments. Yet, lymphoma survivors' participation in physical activities remains suboptimal, which has been further exacerbated by the deleterious effects of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lymfit intervention aims to offer motivational support, expert guidance, and a personalized exercise prescription to optimize physical activities among lymphoma survivors. This proof-of-concept study explores implementation feasibility (retention, technical and safety), and the preliminary effects of Lymfit on various health outcomes.",
        "This was a single-armed trial with a pre-and post-test design. Twenty lymphoma survivors were recruited to participate in the 12-week Lymfit intervention. Wearable activity trackers (Fitbit) were given to participants as a motivational tool and for data collection purposes. Participants received a personalized exercise prescription designed by a kinesiologist. Physiologic metrics were collected by the Fitbit monitors and were stored in the Lymfit database. Self-reported questionnaires measuring health outcomes were collected at baseline and post-intervention.",
        "The retention rate of this trial was 70%. Minimal technical issues and no adverse effects were reported. Lymfit led to significant improvements in sleep disturbances and the ability to participate in social activities and decreased fear of cancer recurrence. It also increased daily steps and decreased sedentary time in participants who did not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines.",
        "With access to resources and fitness centers being limited during the pandemic, the Lymfit intervention filled an immediate need to provide physical activity guidance to lymphoma survivors. Findings provide preliminary support that implementing the Lymfit intervention is feasible and demonstrated promising results."
