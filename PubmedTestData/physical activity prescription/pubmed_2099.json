        "The purpose of respiratory muscle training for patients with chronic respiratory failure is to improve exercise performance during daily life. Firstly, to confirm the clinical effect on respiratory muscle training, the abdominal pad method for inspiratory muscle training and abdominal pad method with expiratory resistor for both inspiratory and expiratory muscle training were simultaneously performed. Both methods were clinically useful to increase respiratory muscle power and to subjectively decrease dyspnea. Ventilatory pattern analyzed by the Konno-Mead (K-M) diagram during exercise also showed their effectiveness. Secondly, the influence of hypoxemia and hypophosphatemia, which are important factors producing respiratory muscle fatigue, was investigated in a patient with respiratory failure. (1) O2 inhalation in patients receiving home oxygen therapy was effective in terms of the endurance time and ventilatory pattern analyzed by the K-M diagram during exercise. (2) A case of hypercapnea due to hypoventilation caused by respiratory muscle fatigue developed reduced PaCO2 following correction of serum phosphate level, suggesting that hypophosphatemia is an important clinical factor producing respiratory muscle fatigue."
