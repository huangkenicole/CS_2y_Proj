        "Exercise intensity is a key parameter for exercise prescription but the optimal range for individuals with high cardiorespiratory fitness is unknown. The aims of this study were (1) to determine optimal heart rate ranges for men with high cardiorespiratory fitness based on percentages of maximal oxygen consumption (%VO(2max)) and reserve oxygen consumption (%VO(2reserve)) corresponding to the ventilatory threshold and respiratory compensation point, and (2) to verify the effect of advancing age on the exercise intensities. Maximal cardiorespiratory testing was performed on 210 trained men. Linear regression equations were calculated using paired data points between percentage of maximal heart rate (%HR(max)) and %VO(2max) and between percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR) and %VO(2reserve) attained at each minute during the test. Values of %VO(2max) and %VO(2reserve) at the ventilatory threshold and respiratory compensation point were used to calculate the corresponding values of %HR(max) and %HRR, respectively. The ranges of exercise intensity in relation to the ventilatory threshold and respiratory compensation point were achieved at 78-93% of HR(max) and 70-93% of HRR, respectively. Although absolute heart rate decreased with advancing age, there were no age-related differences in %HR(max) and %HRR at the ventilatory thresholds. Thus, in men with high cardiorespiratory fitness, the ranges of exercise intensity based on %HR(max) and %HRR regarding ventilatory threshold were 78-93% and 70-93% respectively, and were not influenced by advancing age."
