        "The post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2, also known as \"Long COVID,\" is characterized by profound fatigue, impaired functional capacity with post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and tachycardia. At least 25-30% of individuals impacted by SARS-CoV-2 will go on to experience the Long COVID syndrome, underscoring the detrimental impact this condition has on society. Although efforts are underway to further understand risk factors for Long COVID and identify strategies to prevent disease development entirely, implementation of treatment strategies is warranted to alleviate symptom burden among those affected. This review provides a rationale for exercise prescriptions tailored to the Long COVID patient based on the pathophysiology underlying this syndrome, as well as the previously demonstrated benefits of exercise training in other similar populations whose clinical manifestations result from cardiac deconditioning. Herein, we discuss methods to tailor exercise protocols, accommodating exercise intolerance and post-exertional malaise that may otherwise limit the ability to participate in a training protocol, as well as data demonstrating that a focused exercise prescription may effectively alleviate symptom burden in these patients. Long COVID results, in large part, from deconditioning, which may result from as little as 20 hr of inactivity. Exercise prescriptions tailored to patients with Long COVID may effectively alleviate symptom burden associated with this condition and in the absence of overt contraindications should be considered in management."
