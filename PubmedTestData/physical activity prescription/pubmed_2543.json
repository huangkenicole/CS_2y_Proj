      "AbstractText": [
        "Pilates can be performed by children as a form of exercise to promote healthy growth and development. The increasing use of Pilates as a type of exercise for children or as an adjunct tool in pediatric rehabilitation should be supported by evidence of its benefits. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of Pilates as an exercise prescription for children and adolescents.",
        "Five electronic databases were searched to identify trials (randomized controlled clinical trials or quasi-experimental studies) with a population of children or adolescents in which Pilates (mat or equipment) was performed as a form of exercise. Studies that investigated outcomes related to health and physical performance was analyzed. Individual trial effects were extracted and pooled for meta-analysis whenever possible. To evaluate the external and internal validity of the studies, we assessed their risk of bias.",
        "Fifteen studies (from 945 records), including 1235 participants, met the eligibility criteria, and were included. The reported outcomes were heterogeneous, so only the effect on flexibility could be included in the meta-analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a04 studies). A significant positive trend toward improved flexibility for the control group compared with the Pilates group was found (Std. mean difference, 0.54; 95%CI: 0,18, 0.91; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).",
        "Few studies have assessed the effect of Pilates on children and adolescents. The lack of appropriate methodological descriptions/controls made it impossible to determine if all of the included studies were of good quality."
