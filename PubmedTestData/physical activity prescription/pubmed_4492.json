        "In current health care systems, long-duration stretching, performed daily, cannot be obtained through prescriptions of physical therapy. In addition, the short-term efficacy of the various stretching techniques is disputed, and their long-term effects remain undocumented.",
        "To evaluate changes in extensibility in 6 lower limb muscles and in ambulation speed after a \u22651-year self-stretch program, the Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract (GSC), in individuals with chronic spastic paresis.",
        "Retrospective study.",
        "Neurorehabilitation clinic.",
        "Patients diagnosed with hemiparesis or paraparesis at least 1 year before the initiation of a GSC and who were then involved in the GSC program for at least 1 year.",
        "For each patient, specific muscles were identified for intervention among the following: gluteus maximus, hamstrings, vastus, rectus femoris, soleus, and gastrocnemius. Prescriptions and training for a daily, high-load, prolonged, home self-stretching program were primarily based on the baseline coefficient of shortening, defined as C<sub>SH</sub> = [(X<sub>N</sub> -X<sub>V1</sub>)/X<sub>N</sub>] (X<sub>V1</sub> = PROM, passive range of motion; X<sub>N</sub> = normally expected amplitude).",
        "Six assessments were performed per year, measuring the Tardieu X<sub>V1</sub> or maximal slow stretch range of motion angle (PROM), C<sub>SH</sub>, 10-m ambulation speed, and its functional ambulation category (Perry's classification: household, limited, or full). Changes from baseline in self-stretched and nonself-stretched muscles were compared, with meaningful X<sub>V1</sub> change defined as \u0394X<sub>V1</sub> >5\u00b0 for plantar flexors and >10\u00b0 for proximal muscles. Correlation between the composite X<sub>V1</sub> (mean PROM for the 6 muscles) and ambulation speed also was evaluated.",
        "Twenty-seven GSC participants were identified (14 women, mean age 44 years, range 29-59): 18 with hemiparesis and 9 with paraparesis. After 1 year, 47% of self-stretched muscles showed meaningful change in PROM (\u0394X<sub>V1</sub>) versus 14% in nonself-stretched muscles (P < .0001, \u03c7<sup>2</sup>). \u0394C<sub>SH</sub> was -31% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -41.5 to -15.2) in self-stretched versus -7% (95% CI -11.9 to -2.1) in nonself-stretched muscles (P < .0001, t-test). Ambulation speed increased by 41% (P < .0001) from 0.81 m/s (95% CI 0.67-0.95) to 1.15 m/s (95% CI 1.01-1.29). Eight of the 12 patients (67%) who were in limited or household categories at baseline moved to a higher functional ambulation category. There was a trend for a correlation between composite X<sub>V1</sub> and ambulation speed (r = 0.44, P = .09) in hemiparetic patients.",
        "Therapists should consider prescribing and monitoring a long-term lower limb self-stretch program using GSC, as this may increase muscle extensibility in adult-onset chronic paresis.",
