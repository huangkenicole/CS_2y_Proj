        "The atopic diseases, asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, are common in children, adolescents and young adults. They may have important consequences on physical exercise, especially asthma.",
        "Elite athletes have been observed to have a high prevalence of asthma (and perhaps also rhinitis). The reasons for this observation are still debated, but different mechanisms linked to the intensity of physical activity in athletes are probably involved. Exercise-induced symptoms should be confirmed not only from the clinical history but also by objective measurements of lung function. In elite athletes confirmation of exercise-induced asthma might be difficult and may require special diagnostic tests such as bronchial provocation by eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation. Several drugs are effective in exercise-induced prevention of nasal and bronchial symptoms. Therapeutic approaches for atopic diseases in international guidelines (GINA and ARIA) are generally compatible with anti-doping laws but require compliance with specific prescription rules.",
        "A better understanding of mechanisms and risk factors involved in the increase of asthma prevalence in elite athletes may permit prevention by modifying training conditions during exercise.",
        "Atopic diseases are common in athletes. They require special therapeutic considerations. The increasing prevalence of respiratory asthma-like symptoms in elite athlete is opening new paths for research into airway physiology in extreme conditions."
