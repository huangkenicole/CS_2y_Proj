        "This study investigated the effect of \u03b2-blockade on physiological and perceived exertion (RPE) responses during incremental treadmill exercise.",
        "Sixteen healthy participants (n = 8 men; age, 25.3 \u00b1 4.6 yr) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test after ingestion of 100 mg metoprolol or placebo, with a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced design. Heart rate (HR), ventilatory, and gas exchange variables were measured continuously, and participants reported RPE at the end of each minute. Physiological and RPE responses during each condition were compared at the ventilatory threshold (VT), respiratory compensation point, and at maximal exercise using repeated-measures ANOVA. Linear regression modeled relationships between perceived exertion and physiological variables.",
        "The HR and V\u02d9O2 at the VT, respiratory compensation point, and maximal exercise were all significantly lower after \u03b2-blockade (P < 0.05). However, when standardized to within condition peak values, differences were no longer significant. The RPE associated with VT was higher after \u03b2-blockade (12.9 \u00b1 1.0 vs 12.3 \u00b1 1.2, P < 0.05) but lower at maximal exercise (19.1 \u00b1 0.6 vs 19.4 \u00b1 0.5, P < 0.05). Increases in RPE relative to HR were greater after \u03b2-blockade and remained significant when expressed relative to peak HR. There was no difference in the growth of the relationship between RPE and V\u02d9O2 across conditions, although the origin of the relationship was higher with \u03b2-blockade.",
        "Although \u03b2-blockade resulted in a significant reduction in exercising HR and V\u02d9O2, the RPE for a given relative intensity remained unchanged. The relationship between RPE and V\u02d9O2 was not affected by \u03b2-blockade. The results provide evidence that RPE is a useful and reliable measure for exercise testing and prescription in patients prescribed \u03b2-blockade therapy."
