        "Community health promotion activities are a useful tool for a proactive approach to healthy lifestyles. However, the implementation of these types of activities at health centers is not standardized. The aim of this review was to analyse the characteristics of community activities undertaken in the primary care setting and substantiate available evidence on their health impact. We conducted a bibliographic review until November 15th, 2023 in the TRIPDATABASE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and DIALNET databases. We included original papers on interventions, community activities, and actions and/or social prescriptions which had been implemented in a Primary Care setting, included a group approach in at least one session, and described some type of evaluation of the intervention applied. Studies targeted at professionals and those without involvement of the primary care team were excluded. The search identified 1912 potential studies. We included a total of 30 studies, comprising 11 randomized clinical trials, 14 quasi-experimental studies, 1 cohort study, and 4 qualitative studies. The issues most frequently addressed in community activities were healthy habits, physical activity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Community activities can improve the physical and psychological environment of their participants, as well as their level of knowledge about the issues addressed. That said, however, implementation of these types of interventions is not uniform. The existence of a professional community-activity liaison officer at health centers, who would help integrate the health system with the community sector, could serve to standardize implementation and maximize the health impact of these types of interventions."
