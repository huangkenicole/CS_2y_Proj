        "Students wore low-vision simulation goggles while engaging in medication management tasks. Students also reflected on their experiences in journals and developed modalities to improve low-vision patients' access to prescription information.",
        "Results of a perception survey indicated that students were able to identify and differentiate among various low-vision medication management difficulties. Students' reflections suggested that they recognized the challenges encountered by low-vision patients. All patient assistance project submissions were suitable for the targeted populations and medication management difficulties. Peer review and student feedback of the activities were favorable.",
        "Through this low-vision goggle simulation exercise and other activities, students were able to identify the medication management difficulties encountered by low-vision patients and propose solutions to their drug information access problems."
