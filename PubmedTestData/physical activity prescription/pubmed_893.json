        "<b>Objective:</b> To study the long-term effects of weight reduction, quality of life and sense of coherence in a primary health care (PHC)-based programme with two different intensities.<b>Design:</b> Prospective two-armed randomised intervention.<b>Setting:</b> Three PHC centres in south west of Sweden.<b>Subjects:</b> In total, 289 women and men aged 40-65\u2009years with a BMI of 28-35 were recruited for a two-year weight-reduction programme. Participants were randomized to high-intensity or low-intensity groups. Blood samples, physical measurements and questionnaires were analysed. Participants received cookbooks and dietary lectures. The high-intensity group also received Motivational interviewing (MI), dietary advice on prescription (DAP- advice), a grocery store lecture, a website and weekly e-mails.<b>Main outcome measures:</b> Weight, quality of life, risks and health factors.<b>Results:</b> In total, 182 (64%) participants completed the 2-year follow-up. The total sample reduced their weight by 1\u2009kg (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.006). No significant differences regarding weight were found between the groups. Anxiety/depression decreased in EQ5-D (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.021), EQ5-D VAS (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.002) and SOC (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.042). Between the groups, there were significant differences in EQ5-D usual activities (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.004), anxiety/depression (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.013), pain/discomfort <i>(p =</i> 0.041), fruit and vegetables (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.005), HLV anxiety (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.005), and visits to nurses (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.012).<b>Conclusion:</b> The total population lost weight, and the high-intensity and low-intensity programmes did not result in significant differences in terms of weight. The high-intensity programme reported health benefits linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression, increased activity and intake of greens and reduced visits to physicians and nurses.Key pointsBoth groups had a consisting weight- reduction after two years.High intensity did not lead to a significant difference in weight reduction between the groups.The high-intensity group reported more health effects, such as better quality of life, reduced anxiety, and increased greenery intake. It is unknown how much support patients in a weight- reduction programme in PHC require to succeed with weight loss and a healthy lifestyle."
