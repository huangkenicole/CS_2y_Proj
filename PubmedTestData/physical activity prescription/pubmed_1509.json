        "For midlife and older women, this period of their life is associated with an increase in risk factors for the development of chronic medical conditions. Data confirms the importance of regular exercise for both prevention and management of cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases, unwanted weight gain, worsening metabolic profile and osteoporosis. However, in most clinical practices, midlife and older women patients are not offered specific exercise guidance.",
        "This review assessed the current environment of what exercise advice is being offered to women at clinical encounters and suggests ways of incorporating an exercise prescription into clinical practice.",
        "A PubMed review of the literature from the past 20 years was conducted.",
        "A universal template for an exercise prescription for aging women does not exist. Globally, there are scant programs that offer exercise advice and interventions to patients at the end of clinical encounters.",
        "Although most aging women know the benefits of engaging in a regular exercise program, many do not establish a regular routine. By the clinician offering an exercise prescription, this not only reinforces the importance of exercise but also provides simple guidelines on how women can commence an exercise routine in their life."
