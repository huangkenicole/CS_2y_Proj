        "The purpose of this study was to characterize the growth and remodeling molecular signaling response in aged skeletal muscle following 1 mo of \"resistance-type exercise\" training. Male Fischer 344 \u00d7 Brown Norway hybrid rats aged 3 (young) and 30 mo (old) underwent stretch-shortening contraction (SSC) loading 2 or 3 days/wk; muscles were removed 72 h posttraining. Young rats SSC loaded 3 (Y3x) or 2 days/wk (Y2x) adapted via increased work performance. Old rats SSC loaded 3 days/wk (O3x) maladapted via decreased negative work; however, old rats SSC loaded 2 days/wk (O2x) adapted through improved negative and positive work. Y3x, Y2x, and O2x, but not O3x, displayed hypertrophy via larger fiber area and myonuclear domains. Y3x, Y2x, and O2x differentially expressed 19, 30, and 8 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt genes, respectively, whereas O3x only expressed 2. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that rats in the adapting groups presented growth and remodeling processes (i.e., increased protein synthesis), whereas O3x demonstrated inflammatory signaling. In conclusion, reducing SSC-loading frequency in aged rodents positively influences the molecular signaling microenvironment, promoting muscle adaptation. <b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Decreasing resistance-type exercise training frequency in old rodents led to adaptation through enhancements in performance, fiber areas, and myonuclear domains. Modifying frequency influenced the molecular environment through improvements in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway-specific expression and bioinformatics indicating increased protein synthesis. Reducing training frequency may be appropriate in older individuals who respond unfavorably to higher frequencies (i.e., maladaptation); overall, modifying the parameters of the exercise prescription can affect the cellular environment, ultimately leading to adaptive or maladaptive outcomes."
