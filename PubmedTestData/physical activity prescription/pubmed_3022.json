        "In the current era, the majority of children born with congenital heart disease (CHD) will survive well into adulthood because of major advances in surgical techniques, as well as in critical and medical care. However, reoperation and palliative surgical interventions are increasingly common in the adults with CHD. Tools to risk stratify patients effectively and therapies to improve outcomes are required to optimize the management of adult patients with CHD during the preoperative and postoperative periods and beyond. Exercise testing is an invaluable tool to guide risk stratification. In addition, exercise training in patients with CHD may decrease postoperative complications by enhancing physiological reserve and also has an important role in physical rehabilitation. This review aims to provide individualized recommendations on exercise prescription in patients with CHD in the preoperative and postoperative settings. The response to exercise testing and prognostic implications is also discussed."
