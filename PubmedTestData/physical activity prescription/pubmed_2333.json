        "The regulation of care services has become the principal means by which the state influences provision. In this article we examine the regulation of dementia care within organizations to show how some care activities attract more regulation than others. While often perceived to be overwhelming, regulation is in fact unevenly distributed at the system, organization and, in particular, the care practice levels. In practice, some areas of care are heavily regulated, while others are less so. Drawing on research interviews with staff (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a060) at three levels of care provider organizations-senior managers, facility managers, and direct care workers-a continuum of regulation, with regulations collecting around some care activities and not others, is developed. This is used to plot how different care activities are affected by regulation. Understanding how regulations collect around some activities and not others shows where flexibility and innovation in care are possible. This has implications for the discretion care workers can exercise in daily care, effective organizational strategies for managing care and regulation, and regulatory policy. Current debates around regulation should shift from notions of good/bad and more/less regulation to an analysis of how regulation creates areas that are closely controlled and those that allow practice innovation."
