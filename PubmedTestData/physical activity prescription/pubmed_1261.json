        "This report analyzes the delivery of exercise conditioning services in the 1991 Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware regional survey of pulmonary rehabilitation programs.",
        "Data from a questionnaire was analyzed with special consideration given to whether the program provided services for patients with only pulmonary diseases (n = 41) or with cardiac and pulmonary diseases (n = 18).",
        "All 59 programs included exercise conditioning. Most programs (67%) used oxygen saturation and/or expired gas analysis for writing exercise prescriptions. Only pulmonary programs used 6- or 12-minute walk data. The exercise prescription was written by nonphysicians in 51% of the programs. Most pulmonary-only programs used respiratory therapists by themselves or in combination with other professionals as exercise supervisors (71%). Cardiopulmonary programs used exercise physiologists by themselves (22%) or nurses by themselves or in combination with other professionals (50%). For all programs, the standard for ratio of patients to exercise staff averaged 3.0:1. Pulmonary-only programs did slightly but significantly more continuous arterial oxygen percent saturation (SaO2) monitoring rather than spot checking. A standard determining the use of supplemental oxygen during exercise was reported by 78% of all programs. Most used supplemental oxygen after observing the SaO2 level falling to < 90%. Electrocardiograph monitoring was done in 66% of pulmonary-only programs, but in 94% of the cardiopulmonary programs. Maintenance sessions were offered by 64% of the pulmonary-only programs and also by 78% of the cardiopulmonary programs.",
        "The type of rehabilitation program, either pulmonary-only or cardiopulmonary, appears to influence the exercise conditioning services used by the pulmonary patient."
