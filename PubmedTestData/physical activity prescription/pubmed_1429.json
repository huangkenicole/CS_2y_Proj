        "It remains unclear whether high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) elicits distinct molecular responses to traditional endurance exercise relative to the total work performed. We aimed to investigate the influence of exercise intensity on acute perturbations to skeletal muscle mitochondrial function (respiration and reactive oxygen species) and metabolic and redox signaling responses. In a randomized, repeated measures crossover design, eight recreationally active individuals (24\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yr; V\u0307o<sub>2peak</sub>: 48\u2009\u00b1\u200911 ml\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) undertook continuous moderate-intensity [CMIE: 30 min, 50% peak power output (PPO)], high-intensity interval (HIIE: 5 \u00d7 4 min, 75% PPO, work matched to CMIE), and low-volume sprint interval (SIE: 4 \u00d7 30 s) exercise, \u22657 days apart. Each session included muscle biopsies at baseline, immediately, and 3 h postexercise for high-resolution mitochondrial respirometry ( Jo<sub>2</sub>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission ( Jh<sub>2</sub>o<sub>2</sub>) and gene and protein expression analysis. Immediately postexercise and irrespective of protocol, Jo<sub>2</sub> increased during complex I + II leak/state 4 respiration but Jh<sub>2</sub>o<sub>2</sub> decreased ( P < 0.05). AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl co-A carboxylase phosphorylation increased ~1.5 and 2.5-fold respectively, while thioredoxin-reductase-1 protein abundance was ~35% lower after CMIE vs. SIE ( P < 0.05). At 3 h postexercise, regardless of protocol, Jo<sub>2</sub> was lower during both ADP-stimulated state 3 OXPHOS and uncoupled respiration ( P < 0.05) but Jh<sub>2</sub>o<sub>2</sub> trended higher ( P < 0.08) and PPARGC1A mRNA increased ~13-fold, and peroxiredoxin-1 protein decreased ~35%. In conclusion, intermittent exercise performed at high intensities has similar dynamic effects on muscle mitochondrial function compared with endurance exercise, irrespective of whether total workload is matched. This suggests exercise prescription can accommodate individual preferences while generating comparable molecular signals known to promote beneficial metabolic adaptations."
