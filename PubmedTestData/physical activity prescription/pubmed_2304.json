        "A sedentary lifestyle predisposes to cardiometabolic diseases. Lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity improve a range of cardiometabolic risk factors. The objective of this study was to examine whether functional changes in adipose tissue were related to these improvements.",
        "Seventy-three sedentary, overweight (mean BMI 29.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u2009kg/m2) and abdominally obese, but otherwise healthy men and women (67.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009years) from a randomised controlled trial of physical activity on prescription over a 6-month period were included (control n\u2009=\u200943, intervention n\u2009=\u200930). Detailed examinations were carried out at baseline and at follow-up, including fasting blood samples, a comprehensive questionnaire and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies for fatty acid composition analysis (n\u2009=\u200973) and quantification of mRNA expression levels of 13 candidate genes (n\u2009=\u200951), including adiponectin, leptin and inflammatory cytokines.",
        "At follow-up, the intervention group had a greater increase in exercise time (+137 min/week) and a greater decrease in body fat mass (-1.5\u2009kg) compared to the control subjects (changes of 0 min/week and -0.5\u2009kg respectively). Circulating concentrations of adiponectin were unchanged, but those of leptin decreased significantly more in the intervention group (-1.8 vs -1.1\u2009ng/mL for intervention vs control, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The w6-polyunsaturated fatty acid content, in particular linoleic acid (18:2w6), of adipose tissue increased significantly more in the intervention group, but the magnitude of the change was small (+0.17 vs +0.02 percentage points for intervention vs control, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Surprisingly leptin mRNA levels in adipose tissue increased in the intervention group (+107% intervention vs -20% control, P\u2009<\u20090.05), but changes in expression of the remaining genes did not differ between the groups.",
        "After a 6-month period of increased physical activity in overweight elderly individuals, circulating leptin concentrations decreased despite increased levels of leptin mRNA in adipose tissue. Otherwise, only minor changes occurred in adipose tissue, although several improvements in metabolic parameters accompanied the modest increase in physical activity."
