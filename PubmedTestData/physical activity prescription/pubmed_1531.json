      "AbstractText": [
        "Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal pain. Exercise is a core recommended treatment. Despite some clinical guidelines also recommending weight loss for hip OA, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCT) to substantiate these recommendations. This superiority, 2-group, parallel RCT will compare a combined diet and exercise program to an exercise only program, over 6\u2009months.",
        "One hundred people with symptomatic and radiographic hip OA will be recruited from the community. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomly allocated to either, i) diet and exercise or; ii) exercise only. Participants in the diet and exercise group will have six consultations with a dietitian and five consultations with a physiotherapist via videoconferencing over 6\u2009months. The exercise only group will have five consultations with a physiotherapist via videoconferencing over 6\u2009months. The exercise program for both groups will include prescription of strengthening exercise and a physical activity plan, advice about OA management and additional educational resources. The diet intervention includes prescription of a ketogenic very low-calorie diet with meal replacements and educational resources to support weight loss and healthy eating. Primary outcome is self-reported hip pain via an 11-point numeric rating scale (0\u2009=\u2009'no pain' and 10 = 'worst pain possible') at 6\u2009months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported body weight (at 0, 6 and 12\u2009months) and body mass index (at 0, 6 and 12\u2009months), visceral fat (measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at 0 and 6\u2009months), pain, physical function, quality of life (all measured using subscales of the Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale at 0, 6 and 12\u2009months), and change in pain and physical activity (measured using 7-point global rating of change Likert scale at 6 and 12\u2009months). Additional measures include adherence, adverse events and cost-effectiveness.",
        "This study will determine whether a diet intervention in addition to exercise provides greater hip pain-relief, compared to exercise alone. Findings will assist clinicians in providing evidence-based advice regarding the effect of a dietary intervention on hip OA pain.",
