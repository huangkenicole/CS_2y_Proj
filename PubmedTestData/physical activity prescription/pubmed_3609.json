        "Cryotherapy has historically been used as a treatment following knee surgery. In the literature, there is little evidence of beneficial effects which support this practice. This study examined the effects of cryotherapy treatments on 45 subjects following minor arthroscopic knee surgery. Subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups and the assessor remained blind to treatment group allocation. Subjects performed a 1-week home program of either cryotherapy and exercises or exercises alone. One week following surgery, a statistically significant difference was found between the groups for the affective dimension of the McGill pain questionnaire, medication consumption, compliance, and weight-bearing status. No significant differences were found between the groups for other outcome variables. These results indicate that the addition of cryotherapy to a regime of exercises following arthroscopic knee surgery produced benefits of increased compliance, improved weight-bearing status, and lower prescription medication consumption."
