        "The lactate threshold (LT), critical power (CP) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO\u2082max) together partition exercise intensity domains by their common physiological, biochemical and perceptual response characteristics. CP is the greatest power output attainable immediately following intolerance at VO\u2082peak, and the asymptote of 3 min all-out exercise. Thus we reasoned that a maximal 'sprint' immediately following standard ramp-incremental exercise would allow characterisation of the three aerobic indices in a single test.",
        "Ten healthy men (23 \u00b1 3 year, mean \u00b1 SD) performed 9 cycle-ergometry tests on different days: (A) two ramp-incremental tests to intolerance (20 W min(-1)), immediately followed by a 3 min maximal, variable-power effort ramp-sprint test (RST) for LT, VO\u2082peak and sprint-phase power (SP) determination; (B) four constant-power tests for CP and VO\u2082max determination; (C) constant-power tests at 10 W below LT, and 10 W below and above SP to verify intensity domain characterisation. Capillary [lactate] and breath-by-breath VO\u2082 were measured.",
        "Reproducibility of LT, SP and VO\u2082max measurements between RST repeats was within 5% or less (r \u2265 0.991, p < 0.001). CP (257 \u00b1 46 W) was not different (p = 0.72) from SP (258 \u00b1 42 W). Exercise 10 W below LT and SP resulted in steady state VO\u2082 and [lactate]. VO\u2082max (4.0 \u00b1 0.6 L min(-1)), peak [lactate] (11 \u00b1 2 mM) and intolerance were reached 19 \u00b1 5 min into exercise at 10 W above SP.",
        "These data suggest that the key indices of aerobic function may be accurately and reliably estimated during a single exercise test. This test may provide a basis for simplifying assessment and prescription of exercise training and experimental interventions."
