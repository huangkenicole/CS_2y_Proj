        "Compare the effects and costs of remotely monitored exercise-based cardiac telerehabilitation (REMOTE-CR) with centre-based programmes (CBexCR) in adults with coronary heart disease (CHD).",
        "Participants were randomised to receive 12\u2009weeks of telerehabilitation or centre-based rehabilitation. REMOTE-CR provided individualised exercise prescription, real-time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory-based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; CBexCR provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24\u2009weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health-related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non-inferior between-group difference in V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>max at 12\u2009weeks (inferiority margin=-1.25\u2009mL/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes.",
        "162 participants (mean 61\u00b112.7\u2009years, 86% men) were randomised. V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> max was comparable in both groups at 12\u2009weeks and REMOTE-CR was non-inferior to CBexCR (REMOTE-CR-CBexCR adjusted mean difference (AMD)=0.51 (95% CI -0.97 to 1.98)\u2009mL/kg/min, p=0.48). REMOTE-CR participants were less sedentary at 24\u2009weeks (AMD=-61.5 (95% CI -117.8 to -5.3) min/day, p=0.03), while CBexCR participants had smaller waist (AMD=1.71 (95% CI 0.09 to 3.34)\u2009cm, p=0.04) and hip circumferences (AMD=1.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 2.27)\u2009cm, p=0.04) at 12\u2009weeks. No other between-group differences were detected. Per capita programme delivery (NZD1130/GBP573 vs NZD3466/GBP1758) and medication costs (NZD331/GBP168 vs NZD605/GBP307, p=0.02) were lower for REMOTE-CR. Hospital service utilisation costs were not statistically significantly different (NZD3459/GBP1754 vs NZD5464/GBP2771, p=0.20).",
        "REMOTE-CR is an effective, cost-efficient alternative delivery model that could-as a complement to existing services-improve overall utilisation rates by increasing reach and satisfying unique participant preferences."
