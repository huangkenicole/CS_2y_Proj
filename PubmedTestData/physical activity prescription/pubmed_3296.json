        "To present clinical recommendations for osteoporosis prevention that include new support for routine bone mass screening of asymptomatic perimenopausal high-risk women. Technological advances make it conceivable that osteoporosis, a metabolic bone disorder rather than a true disease, can be prevented on a wide scale and eventually eliminated. Effective prevention requires that advanced screening procedures be easily accessible and reimbursable as a wise healthcare investment.",
        "This article reviews research bearing on clinical management of women potentially at risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Background includes the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and known risk factors such as heredity, life-style, gynecological history, eating disorders, endocrinopathies, and scoliosis. Studies of bone mass measurement favor dual-energy roentgenographic absorptiometry as the bone densitometry method of choice for screening women at risk and for use with roentgenograms in evaluating bone health. The balance between bone formation and resorption can be assessed by a number of biochemical markers, which are reviewed. Other factors known to affect bone mass are discussed.",
        "Primary care physicians, especially gynecologists, can play a pivotal role by [1] identifying women with higher risks for osteoporosis at earlier ages; [2] stressing the importance of developing maximal bone mass before menopause; and [3] developing individualized patient prescriptions for bone mass determinants under personal control: exercise, nutrition (e.g., calcium and vitamin D), life-style, and hormone replacement therapy."
