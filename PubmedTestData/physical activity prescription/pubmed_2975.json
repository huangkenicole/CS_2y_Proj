        "To investigate current clinical practice of Swiss physiotherapists treating patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) from pre-operative rehabilitation until return to sport (RTS). We assessed optimisation strategies in daily practice and the perceived barriers to these optimisations, and evaluated whether there was a relevant difference in clinical practice for physiotherapists with post-graduate certification in sports physiotherapy or deep clinical experience and those without such experience.",
        "Cross-sectional survey.",
        "Online survey platform.",
        "Swiss physiotherapists.",
        "The survey comprised six sections: participant information, pre-operative rehabilitation, post-operative rehabilitation, RTS, re-injury prevention, and optimisation strategies and barriers.",
        "A minority of physiotherapists treated ACLR patients pre-operatively. Overall, 91% included quadriceps open kinetic chain exercise in their treatment, 37% used patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) and 39% considered psychological criteria when making decisions about RTS. Most physiotherapists (67%) felt limited due to the time available, the number of prescriptions and the tariffication system.",
        "This study highlights areas within ACLR rehabilitation practice in Switzerland that could be improve. Improvements in understanding of the barriers to implementation of best evidence in practice and a redefinition of the clinical process around ACLR rehabilitation in Switzerland are necessary."
