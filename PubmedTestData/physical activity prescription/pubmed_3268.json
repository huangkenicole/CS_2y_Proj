        "To determine the distribution of match-activities relative to maximum-intensities during official match in elite soccer players. One hundred and forty-eight Italian Serie A soccer players were monitored during 46 official matches (680 individual-samples). Total distance (TD), high-speed running (HSR), very high-speed running (VHSR), sprint, acceleration and deceleration were calculated. Maximum-intensities (1-min<sub>peak</sub>) were used as the reference value to determine the distribution of relative intensity across the whole-match demands (90-min<sub>avg</sub>). Time and distance higher than 90-min<sub>avg</sub> (>90-min<sub>avg</sub>) were also calculated. The relative (m\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) 90-min<sub>avg</sub> <i>vs</i>1-min<sub>peak</sub> was 59.6(4.4)% for TD, 26.2(4.4)% for HSR, 16.0(3.5)% for VHSR, 9.3(2.3)% for sprint, 19.2(4.6)% for acceleration and 15.4(5.2)% for deceleration. Total distance covered >90-min<sub>avg</sub> was ~61.4(5.0)% for TD, ~68.6(1.9)% for HSR, ~80.2(1.3)% for VHSR, ~95.7(0.4)% for sprint, ~75.5(1.3)% for acceleration and ~64.0(2.6)% for deceleration. With the exception of <i>small</i> [ES: 0.50 (0.26 to 0.73)] difference for acceleration, the relative distance >90-min<sub>avg</sub> was <i>largely</i> to <i>very largely</i> (ES: 1.64 to 7.78) higher (<i>P</i><\u00a00.05) than the 90-min<sub>avg</sub> for each metric. While no between-position difference (<i>P</i>>\u00a00.05) was found for total minutes >90-min<sub>avg</sub>, between-position differences (<i>P</i><\u00a00.05) for the total distance >90-min<sub>avg</sub> were retrieved across each metric. The distribution of the activities relative to maximal intensities could assist coaches for soccer training prescriptions."
