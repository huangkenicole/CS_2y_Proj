        "The National Service Framework (England) standards related to medicines for children and young people promote the use of non medical prescribing to improve children's access to appropriate medicines. A project was carried out to evaluate non medical prescribing by paediatric nurses across Merseyside, Manchester and Cheshire in the north west of England. Several qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used including facilitated workshops, a questionnaire survey of the current independent/supplementary paediatric nurse prescribers and a scoping exercise of four higher education institutions. A major finding was the need for improved preparation of children's nurses in all aspects of medicines management, particularly practical drug administration at pre-registration level and knowledge of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. If services are to be delivered in line with best practice guidance there needs to be a comprehensive, standardised medicines management education plan that is initiated in pre-registration nurse training, leading to appropriate education for non-medical prescribing roles."
