        "Exercise training programs are usually based on a maximal exercise stress test; however, this test is often difficult and sometimes frightening to older persons. This preliminary study reports on a fixed-distance, submaximal walk test and compares its usefulness for exercise prescription to that of the traditional maximal stress test. Ten cardiac patients, with an average age of 72 years (4 men), had recently clinically indicated maximal graded stress tests. Within one week, each had the walk test, which consisted of walking three times up and back 100 feet in the hospital corridor (total of 600 feet) as rapidly as possible, with a blood pressure cuff on their arm and carrying the electrocardiogram cable. Resting and peak heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and exercise electrocardiograms were compared for the walk test v the maximal stress test. Oxygen consumption was calculated from the peak workload on the maximal stress test and from walking speed on the walk test. The peak heart rates after the walk test were within the target heart rate zone (70-85%) for exercise programming, as obtained from the maximal stress test, in all patients except one. The calculated peak oxygen consumption from the walk test was also within the training zone (60-80%) obtained from the maximal stress test in all patients except one. This pilot study shows that a submaximal, steady state timed walk of 600 feet can be a feasible method of providing the information for exercise programming, possibly avoiding the need for a maximal stress test. This walk test can be performed easily by health-related staff without sophisticated facilities in an inpatient rehabilitation unit or nursing home; however, further study with a larger number of patients is necessary before this method of exercise prescription can be recommended."
