        "To evaluate the long-term effects of calisthenic home exercises on the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women.",
        "Controlled long-term observational study.",
        "Postmenopausal women between 45 and 75 years of age who had been randomly assigned to an exercise or control group in the course of a previous study conducted 5-10 years ago, were invited for follow-up. The number of fractures before and during the observation time were recorded by means of a questionnaire. Vertebral deformities due to fractures were diagnosed by X-rays at entry and at follow-up. Walking speed, muscle strength, static posturography, and maximum oxygen uptake were measured in addition.",
        "After an average follow-up time of 7.6+/-1.1 years, 73 women of the exercise group and 64 subjects of the control group were investigated. Thirty-three per cent (n=24) of the exercise group reported to have exercised continuously at least three times a week for 20 min. No intergroup differences between the compliant and non-compliant exercisers and the control group were seen in the number of fractures. However, the incidence of fracture was lowest in women with a baseline bone mass less than one standard deviation (SD) below the mean for young adults (high BMC) and highest in those with more than 2.5 SD below the mean for young adults (low BMC) (P<0.001, odds ratio 2.9 [95% CI, 1.59-5.39]).",
        "This long-term follow-up did not produce any evidence that prescription of a calisthenic home exercise program may prevent fractures in postmenopausal women aged between 61+/-6.4 and 68+/-6.5 years."
