        "To determine the current level of consumer demand in the purchase and prescription of sugar-free paediatric medicines.",
        "Data were collected by administered questionnaire.",
        "The study was conducted in a Hospital Paediatric Dentistry Unit and a Community Dental Clinic, both within the Bro Taf area of south-east Wales.",
        "The parents of 240 children attending for routine dental care responded to one of two short questionnaires, depending on whether their child had received a liquid oral medicine in the preceding month.",
        "Although aware of the benefits of sugar-free medicines, parents did not appear to be attempting to exercise the power of consumer demand to its full potential. They were more likely to ask a pharmacist (or pharmacist's assistant) than their general medical practitioner for a sugar-free medicine.",
        "We must continue to promote sugar-free medicines. While increasing the importance that health professionals attach to such products, future campaigns should also aim to increase consumer demand."
