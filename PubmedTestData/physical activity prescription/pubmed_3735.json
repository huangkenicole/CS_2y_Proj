        "Low physical activity is considered to be an important risk factor for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. However, few data are reported on the Japanese general population. The authors have studied whether oxygen uptake in physical fitness evaluation is a quantitative index for physical activity and whether or not it has a relation to coronary risk factors.",
        "Five hundred thirteen asymptomatic Japanese (40-64 years of age, 282 males and 231 females) were tested on a cycle ergometer for measurement of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) and oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (VO2AT). Physical activity was estimated by pedometer score. Data for oxygen uptake were adjusted by age or by age and body mass index (BMI), then its relationship to the following risk factors was investigated: physical activity, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and triglycerides.",
        "Subjects in the highest peak VO2 quartile walked significantly more than those in the lowest quartile in both males and females. Those in the highest quartile showed lower BMI, lower blood pressure, lower triglyceride, and higher HDL cholesterol. The same relationship was observed for VO2AT.",
        "Higher fitness level determined by peak VO2 or VO2AT is related to higher physical activity and lower coronary risk factors in the asymptomatic middle-aged Japanese. These data provide support for exercise prescription in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in Japan."
