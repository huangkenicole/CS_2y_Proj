        "Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. With the development of the whole-life-cycle health concept, the focus of treatment for bronchial asthma in children has gradually shifted from pharmacological control to an integrated management model of functional rehabilitation and pharmacological assistance. As a non-pharmacological integrated approach, pulmonary rehabilitation plays an equally important role in the management of childhood asthma as pharmacological treatments. Breathing techniques such as Buteyko breathing, pursed lip breathing, diaphragmatic breathing training, threshold-pressure inspiratory muscle training and yoga breathing can improve lung function indicators such as forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) in children. Comprehensive pre-exercise assessment, development of exercise prescriptions, and implementation and evaluation of exercise effects can improve physical fitness, neuromuscular coordination, and self-confidence of children with asthma. The comprehensive interventions of health education, psychological support and nutritional intervention can improve the compliance and effectiveness of rehabilitation training. This article reviews the research progress on respiratory training, physical exercise, and comprehensive interventions in the pulmonary rehabilitation of asthmatic children, to provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the scientific and rational management of pulmonary rehabilitation of asthmatic children in clinical settings."
