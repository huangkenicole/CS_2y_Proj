      "AbstractText": [
        "Different remote interventions, such as applications (apps), have been used to continue promoting healthy ageing and preventing disability during the COVID-19 pandemic. The growing trend of apps in health is exponential and may facilitate scaling up physical activity prescription. Numerous tools are available, but little is known regarding their appropriateness, validation and recommendation, especially for frail older adults.",
        "In-house, we developed an application that makes both the Apple app Store and the Google Play Store searchable using topic-related keywords and facilitates the extraction of basic app-information of the search results. The study was aimed at apps available to an English-speaking market. The resulting apps were filtered using various inclusion and exclusion criteria. The resultant apps underwent a more in-depth characterisation and searches for scientific publications on each app website and PubMed.",
        "From an initial search result of >2,800 apps, 459 met the initial inclusion criteria. After a more in-depth review of their features, 39 apps remained for possible app in older frail patients. After testing them, 22 apps were excluded. Seventeen apps fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were deemed appropriate after peer review. Of these, only one app, Vivifrail, had any type of publication/published evidence.",
        "Apps can be valuable tool in prescribing exercise for frail older adults living in the community. However, few apps seem useful on a large scale, and there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness. It is important to invest in adapting Information and Communication Technologies to this population group."
