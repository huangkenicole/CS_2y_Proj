        "By means of a questionnaire, we analyzed leisure time habits of 44 adult in-patients with active epilepsy (i.e., at least one seizure a month for the last year). Twelve patients had a generalized epilepsy and 32 a partial epilepsy. All received antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and none had additional handicaps. Despite good facilities in their surroundings for participation in social, cultural, and physical activities, most patients lived a sedentary life. Social contact was limited, and they were only half as active physically as the average Norwegian population of comparable age and sex. Work capacity was tested as maximum oxygen uptake, using the bicycle ergometer test. Maximum oxygen uptake was considerably lower (75-80%), and the decrease observed in aerobic capacity with increasing age was more pronounced than that of the average Norwegian population. In comprehensive care of patients with epilepsy, we believe that prescription of adapted physical activity is an important means of improving quality of life."
