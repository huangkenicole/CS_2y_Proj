        "The purpose of this commentary is to summarize the evidence of the feasibility and benefits of exercise for cancer patients with complex health profiles. Case studies are used to describe the therapeutic approach taken by exercise professionals. The information presented will assist the cancer care team in understanding their role in supporting these patients to move more.",
        "Professional organizations, peer-reviewed manuscripts, and expert clinical opinion.",
        "Individually-tailored exercise is safe and feasible in the presence of complex health profiles, and all patients can benefit through exercise, regardless of individual circumstance or disease burden. However, to ensure patients benefit through physical activity, including exercise, a multidisciplinary approach, whereby all members of the health care team promote and encourage physical activity is needed.",
        "There is a clear need for collaboration between the oncology team and exercise professionals, particularly when dealing with patients with complex health profiles. These patients are more likely to engage in exercise when they are advised and supported by their oncology team to do so. As such, promotion of physical activity and, when relevant, referral to an exercise professional is the responsibility of all members of the cancer team."
