        "Physical activity has been demonstrated to promote cognitive performance. However, the relationship between physical activity and executive function (EF) in sedentary individuals is not fully understood. This meta-analysis examined the impact of physical activity on EF in sedentary individuals and evaluated potential moderators of the relationship between physical activity and EF. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched. Included studies had to report sedentary individuals randomized to either a physical activity group or a control group. Subgroup analyses of EF sub-domains, exercise prescription and age were conducted alongside the overall meta-analysis. Thirteen RCT studies were included, with a total of 752 participants. Results showed a small to moderate beneficial effect of physical activity on EF (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40). In subgroup analysis by EF sub-domains, physical activity enhanced inhibitory control (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63) and working memory (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.49), but not cognitive flexibility (SMD = 0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.41). Interventions with an intervention length > 12 weeks improved overall EF (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.46), but intervention length \u2264 12 weeks did not (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.47). Interventions with session time \u2265 45 minutes improved overall EF (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.77), but session time < 45 minutes did not (0.17, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.44). Physical activity improves EF for older adults (age \u2265 60 years) (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42), but not for younger individuals (age < 60 years) (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.59). Overall, physical activity has a beneficial effect on EF in sedentary individuals, although the influence may be domain specific and influenced by exercise prescription and age. These findings have practical implications for those seeking to improve EF in sedentary individuals through physical activity."
