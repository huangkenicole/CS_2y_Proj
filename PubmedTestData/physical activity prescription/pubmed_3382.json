        "This study aimed to translate movement patterns, technical skills and tactical actions associated with high-intensity efforts into metrics that could potentially be used to construct position-specific conditioning drills. A total of 20 individual English Premier League players' high-intensity running profiles were observed multiple times (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) using a computerised tracking system. Data were analysed using a novel high-intensity movement programme across five positions (centre back [CB], full-back [FB], central midfielder [CM], wide midfielder [WM] and centre forward [CF]). High-intensity efforts in contact with the ball and the average speed of efforts were greater in WMs than CBs, CMs and CFs (effect sizes [ES]: 0.9-2.1, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). WMs produced more repeated efforts than CBs and CMs (ES: 0.6-1.3, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In possession, WMs executed more tricks post effort than CBs and CMs (ES: 1.2-1.3, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). FBs and WMs performed more crosses post effort than other positions (ES: 1.1-2.0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Out of possession, CFs completed more efforts closing down the opposition (ES: 1.4-5.0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but less tracking opposition runners than other positions (ES: 1.5-1.8, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). CFs performed more arc runs before efforts compared to CBs, FBs and WMs (ES: 0.9-1.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), however, CBs completed more 0-90\u00b0 turns compared to FBs, CMs and WMs (ES: 0.9-1.1, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The data demonstrate unique high-intensity trends in and out of possession that could assist practitioners when devising position-specific drills."
