        "Service learning opportunities allow students to apply their knowledge and skills through engagement with their community. Previous studies have suggested that student-led exercise testing and health screening can benefit both students and their community participants. In a third-year kinesiology course, \"Physiological Assessment and Training,\" students at the University of Prince Edward Island are provided with an introduction to health-focused personal training and develop and manage personalized training programs for community volunteers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of student-led training programs on student learning. A secondary purpose was to investigate the perceptions of community members participating in the program. Community participants included 13 men and 43 women with stable health (mean age: 52.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.0 yr). Students led participants through aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness tests before and after completion of a 4-wk student-designed training program based on participants' fitness and interests. Students reported that the program was enjoyable and improved understanding of fitness concepts and confidence in personal training. Community participants rated the programs as enjoyable and appropriate and viewed students as professional and knowledgeable. These results suggest that student-led personal training programs provide meaningful benefits to students and their community volunteers.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Undergraduate kinesiology students oversaw exercise testing and 4 wk of supervised exercise for community volunteers. Both students and their community participants reported enjoying the experience, and students stated that it also improved their understanding and confidence. These results suggest that student-led personal training programs provide meaningful benefits to students and their community volunteers."
