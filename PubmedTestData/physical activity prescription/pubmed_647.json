        "Holmberg, PM, Gorman, AD, Jenkins, DG, and Kelly, VG. Lower-body aquatic training prescription for athletes. J Strength Cond Res 35(3): 859-869, 2021-Traditionally prescribed to manage various medical ailments and promote healing, aquatic immersion may provide a favorable environment to undertake preparatory training tasks given its profound biological effects that extend across most homeostatic systems. In addition to understanding these effects, which are related to the fundamental principles of hydrodynamics, there is a need to consider the acute physiomechanical responses to alterations of key constraints associated with particular preparatory tasks. Evidence suggests that the manipulation of different constraints during aquatic training can enable a unique setting to complement, supplement, or supplant land-based programming to maintain or improve physical capacities in athletes without exacerbating physiological stress. Thus, this article focuses on the interplay of constraints and their associated outcomes to provide information that can be used to program lower-body aquatic training for athletes. In addition, the aim of the article is to summarize the literature on aquatic training to highlight the outcomes that occur when certain constraints are manipulated."
