        "Physical activity (PA) offers numerous benefits in diabetes prevention and management. These include better glycemic control, reduction of co-morbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, decreased mortality and improved quality of life. Many caretakers are unaware of the specific recommendations and restrictions regarding PA in diabetic patients. This may result in the withholding of an important therapeutic tool from patients, the unnecessary limitation of PA in patients keen to undertake it, or, on the other hand, in adverse reactions to exercise which may be prevented. This review presents PA recommendations in both type 1 and 2 diabetics, which include aerobic activity and strength training. Several safety points before commencing or increasing the intensity of a PA program are also addressed; assessment of the cardiovascular response to exercise, the presence of retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and proper foot care, are essential."
