        "To investigate the sex-difference in relation to the association between moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) patterns with frailty.",
        "Accelerometry from \u226550 year olds from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-04/2005-06 cycles) were included. Bouted and sporadic MVPA were defined as MVPA in \u226510\u2009min or <10\u2009min durations, respectively. MVPA was analyzed based on meeting 0 %, 1-49 %, 50-99 %, and \u2265100 % of the physical activity guidelines of 150\u2009min/week. A duration of \u226530\u2009minutes defined prolonged ST. The frequency (\u22651\u202fmin interruption in ST), intensity and duration of breaks from ST were calculated. A 46-item frailty index (FI) quantified frailty. Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for demographics, total sedentary time, and accelerometer wear time.",
        "There were 1143 females and 1174 males available for analysis. Bouted MVPA was associated with lower frailty levels; the association peaked at meeting 50-99 % of the guidelines in females and \u22651.0 % in males (p\u2009=\u2009NS for sex-interaction). Meeting a higher proportion of the guidelines through sporadic MVPA was significantly associated with a lower FI in males only (p\u2009=\u2009NS for sex-interaction). Prolonged ST bouts were associated with worse frailty in females but not males (p\u2009<\u20090.05 sex-interaction). Average break intensity was associated with a lower FI in both sexes, whereas, total sedentary breaks were not (p\u2009=\u2009NS for sex-interaction). Average break duration was associated with frailty in males (p\u2009=\u2009NS for sex-interaction).",
        "Prolonged ST was more detrimentally associated with frailty in females than males, which could influence tailored movement prescriptions and guidelines."
