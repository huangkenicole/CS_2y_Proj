      "AbstractText": [
        "Obesity, or adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD), is one of the most common health risk factors nowadays. Regular exercise-part of complex lifestyle medicine program-is effective treatment for obesity but is still underestimated. Monitoring andindividualization by an exercise professional is needed to define the accurate dose effect.",
        "The 30-week lifestyle change program of a 65-year-old male patient (body mass index (BMI) 43.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was followed by a medical doctor, exercise physiologist, and nutritionist. Over regular controls and blood tests, each training activity was measured with a heart rate monitor watch, and a diet diary was written.",
        "Bodyweight decreased by 24.1 kg (18.4%) and BMI to 35.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Decreased resting heart rate (from 72 bpm to 63 bpm), diastolic blood pressure (from 72 mmHg to 67 mmHg), and increased systolic blood pressure (from 126 mmHg to 135 mmHg) were reported, besides the reduction in antihypertensive and antidiabetic medicines. Blood test results and fitness level improved, and daily steps and time spent training increased.",
        "Lifestyle medicine with professional support is an effective and long-term treatment for ABCD. Individualized exercise and nutritional therapy are essential, and wearable technology with telemedicine consultation also has an important role."
