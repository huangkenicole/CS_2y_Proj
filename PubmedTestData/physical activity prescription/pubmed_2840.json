        "The authors' class structure incorporates individual meal and exercise planning in the group setting. This study was conducted to (1) determine if class participants can create their own meal and exercise plans, (2) determine if class participants feel they will be able to adhere to their meal and exercise plans, and (3) assess adherence to the plans over time. Subjects were recruited from the classes offered at the Joslin Diabetes Center. Following completion of class, patients completed the evaluation questionnaire. Two and 6 months later, study participants received follow-up questionnaires by phone or mail. Among respondents, 63% were able to determine their own carbohydrate goals, with 95.9% indicating they could adhere to the plan, and 82.8% felt the plan would be easier than previous ones. At 2 and 6 months, respectively, 89% and 92% of the participants felt they were following the meal plan either some or most of the time. One hundred percent of the respondents were able to determine their own exercise plan, with 98% indicating they could adhere to the plan, and 85.7% felt the new plan would be easier than previous ones. At 2 and 6 months, respectively, 70% and 73% felt they were following their exercise plan either some or most of the time. Individualized meal and exercise plans can be successfully created in a group setting."
