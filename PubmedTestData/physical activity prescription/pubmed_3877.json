        "Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an essential intervention in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To guide health care professionals in the implementation and evaluation of a PR program, this article discusses the current key concepts regarding exercise testing, prescription, and training, as well as self-management intervention as essential parts of PR and post-rehabilitation maintenance. Moreover, new approaches (alternative forms of organization and delivery, tele-rehabilitation, exercise adjuncts) and unique and challenging situations (patients experiencing acute exacerbations, advanced disease) are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, validated point-of-care resources and online tools are provided."
