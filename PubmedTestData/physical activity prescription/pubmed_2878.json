        "At present, there are multiple hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the effect of exercise on the postoperative inflammatory factors and the IGF system among breast cancer patients, especially. To determine the underlying mechanisms, prevent the recurrence of breast cancer and improve its prognosis, this paper will systematically evaluate the impact of exercise on inflammatory factors and the IGF system in breast cancer survivors.",
        "The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP (Chinese scientific and technical journals) databases were systematically searched until April 2021. The search terms included 'exercise', 'inflammatory factor', 'IGF system' and 'breast cancer'. A total of 1066 relevant articles were retrieved. The articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, such as study population, intervention method and type of experiment, and 11 articles were ultimately included. All statistical results were analysed using STATA 14.0 and Rstudio 4.1.1.",
        "We found that exercise significantly reduced the level of IGF-1 (WMD, -19.947\u00a0ng/ml; 95% CI, -22.669 to -17.225; P\u2009=\u20090.000). Subgroup analysis showed that in the studies with an intervention period\u2009>\u200912\u00a0weeks, exercise significantly reduced IL-6 levels (WMD, -0.761\u00a0pg/ml; 95% CI, -1.369 to -0.153; p\u2009=\u20090.014), while in the studies with an intervention period\u2009\u2264\u200912\u00a0weeks, exercise significantly reduced CRP (WMD, -2.381\u00a0mg/L; 95% CI, -4.835 to 0.073, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and IL-10 levels (WMD, -7.141\u00a0pg/ml, 95% CI, -10.853 to -3.428; P\u2009=\u20090.000). In addition, aerobic exercise plus resistance training significantly reduced IL-6 levels (WMD, -1.474\u00a0pg/ml; 95% CI, -1.653 to -1.296; P\u2009=\u20090.000). The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that after excluding the studies with high heterogeneity, exercise significantly reduced the TNF-\u03b1 levels in patients with breast cancer (WMD, -1.399\u00a0pg/ml; 95% CI, -1.718 to -1.080; P\u2009=\u20090.000).",
        "Exercise reduces the postoperative levels of IGF-1, IL-6, CRP, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 among patients with breast cancer, which may have a significant impact on inhibiting breast cancer recurrence and improving its prognosis. Future studies should examine the effects of different durations and types of exercise to develop individualized exercise prescriptions for breast cancer patients."
