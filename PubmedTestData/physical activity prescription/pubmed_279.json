        "Medical prescriptions have traditionally been focused on aerobic exercise. However, an increasing number of authors are pointing towards strength training as the healthiest exercise modality. The purpose of this study is to assess whether physicians increase their knowledge as well as their confidence to prescribe strength training after attending a physical training course.",
        "A prospective cohort study of 160 physicians was conducted, 80 physicians out of the 160 attended a physical training course, whereas the remaining 80 physicians did not. Personal and professional data was collected, as well as data regarding the type of exercise they were practising or prescribing and the confidence and knowledge for their prescription. Finally, differences between the two groups and the impact of attending the course where analysed.",
        "Both groups were homogeneous in gender, age, medical speciality and practice of physical exercise, with very low rates of strength training and prescription for both groups. It was established that the group attending the course acquired knowledge and confidence for prescribing strength training. Moreover, this group considered that strength training was the exercise modality which should be encouraged (P<.001).",
        "Education in strength training for physicians by means of a theoretical-practical course increases knowledge and confidence for its prescription."
