        "Hypertension is the leading risk factor for death worldwide, and high levels of physical activity are associated with a lower incidence of hypertension. The associations of excessive levels of exercise and incidence of hypertension are less well known. We aim to compare the incidence of hypertension among 206\u2009889 participants in a long-distance cross-country skiing event and 505\u2009542 people randomly sampled from the general population (matched to the skiers on age, sex, and place of residence).",
        "Skiers' best performance (in percent of winning time) and number of completed races during the study period were associated with incidence of hypertension after participation in Vasaloppet. Hypertension was defined as prescription of blood pressure-lowering drugs as obtained from the national drug registry. Models were adjusted for sex, age, education, and income (total effect).",
        "During a median time of risk of 8.3 years, skiers had a lower incidence of hypertension compared with nonskiers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.58-0.60]). Among the skiers, better performance (in percent of winning time) in Vasaloppet was strongly associated with a lower incidence of hypertension (fastest fifth: HR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.39-0.42]; slowest fifth: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.75-0.81]). The association was nearly linear and did not differ between sexes. Among the skiers, a weaker association was seen between the number of completed races during the study period and the incidence of hypertension (1 race: HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.62-0.65]; >5 races: HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.50-0.53]). A subanalysis of 10\u2009804 participants including adjustment for lifestyle factors showed similar results.",
        "Participation in a long-distance skiing event was associated with a 41% lower incidence of hypertension over the next 8 years compared with nonparticipation. A near linear association between performance and incidence of hypertension was observed. This adds to the list of beneficial effects of intensive training, because hypertension is the leading risk factor of premature death globally."
