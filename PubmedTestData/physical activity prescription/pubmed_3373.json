        "Exercise prescribed by the general practitioner may be an important health-improving intervention for inactive individuals with lifestyle diseases. The objective was to analyse changes in physical activity and health-related quality of life among participants in five similar 'Exercise on Prescription' (EoP) programmes.",
        "The analysis was based on self-reported information in a follow-up design without a control group. The intervention comprised group training twice weekly in the first 2 months and once weekly in the following 2 months (24 sessions in all) combined with four to five sessions of motivational counselling. Self-report questionnaires were administered at the first contact and again after 4, 10 and 16 months. Outcome measures were changes in self-reported activity levels converted to metabolic equivalents and health-related quality of life measured by standard instruments (SF-12v2 and EQ-5D).",
        "449 individuals (59% women, mean age 57 years) agreed to participate in the study. Dropout was considerable [123 (27%); 231 (52%) 297 (66%) after 4, 10 and 16 months]. Participants increased their physical activity level and health-related quality of life from baseline to 4 months and maintained improvement throughout the observation period. One in three to six participants increased their physical activity level and one in 4-10 achieved improvements in health-related quality of life.",
        "Exercise on prescription can contribute to improvements in physical activity level and health-related quality of life in physically inactive patients with or at increased risk of developing lifestyle diseases. An acceptable number of participants achieved and maintained improvements in physical activity level and health-related quality of life."
