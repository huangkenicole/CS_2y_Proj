        "Frailty is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis. Although evidence for prehabilitation is promising, the data for liver transplant (LT) candidates are limited. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel prehabilitation strategy on changes in frailty metrics and survival in LT candidates. The secondary aim was to determine liver-related and extrahepatic conditions associated with frailty.",
        "In this ambispective cohort study, all patients underwent frailty assessment using the liver frailty index (LFI), 6-minute walk test, and gait speed test performed by a dedicated physical therapist. Home-based exercise prescription was individualized to each patient's baseline physical fitness.",
        "We included 517 patients (59% men, median age 61 years, and a model for end-stage liver disease score of 12) evaluated during 936 PT visits. Frailty metrics were affected by age, sex, and liver-related parameters, but not by model for end-stage liver disease. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related cirrhosis had worse frailty metrics by all tools. We demonstrated the feasibility of prehabilitation in improving both LFI and 6-minute walk test, particularly in adherent patients. A median LFI improvement of 0.3 in frail patients was associated with improved survival in univariate analysis. Compliance with physical therapist visits (hazards ratio = 0.35 [0.18-0.67] for 2 visits and hazards ratio = 0.54 [0.31-0.94] for \u22653 visits) was independently associated with increased survival.",
        "Prehabilitation improves frailty metrics in LT candidates and is associated with a survival advantage. Our findings provide a framework for the standardized prehabilitation program in LT candidates while prioritizing compliance, adherence, and on-training LFI goal accomplishment."
