        "Although a growing number of studies have sought to understand what motivates the initiation of prescription stimulant misuse and diversion among college students, there has been a lack of studies focused on what motivates behavior cessation. We aimed to explore what motivates prescription stimulant misuse and diversion cessation, from the perspective of college students with a history of having initiated and then discontinued these behaviors. We conducted face-to-face interviews with students who had a history of misuse, diversion, or both, and who had intentionally, either for the short-term or long-term, ceased these behaviors. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed interviews inductively using a thematic analysis approach. Of the six themes we identified, four applied to both misuse and diversion, while two applied to diversion only. Engaging in related behavior change, seasonality of the behaviors, changes in personal needs, and negative and/or null experiences with the behaviors were themes for both misuse and diversion cessation. Themes that emerged solely for diversion cessation included: moral and legal concerns and not wanting to be perceived as a drug dealer. The information shared by students with first-hand misuse and diversion cessation experience has the potential to guide interventions designed to address prescription stimulant misuse on college campuses."
