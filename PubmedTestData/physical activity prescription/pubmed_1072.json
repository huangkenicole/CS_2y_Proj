        "Many cancer treatments have a negative effect on bone health and can lead to osteoporosis. Additionally, the risk of osteoporosis during cancer survivorship may differ by racial and ethnic group. Overall, cancer survivors may be poorly informed about the risk of bone loss due to treatment.",
        "Exercise can be prescribed to improve bone health and reduce risk of fracture. Women participating in the Improving Physical Activity After Cancer Treatment pilot study (IMPAACT) experienced significant improvements in bone health. The pilot work also suggests that cancer survivors of diverse racial/ethnic profiles may not fit the normal risk profile for osteoporosis and could be overlooked during screening.",
        "The lack of awareness of poor bone health in cancer survivors needs to be addressed, especially for those who do not fit the normal osteoporosis risk profile. Exercise is a safe and effective part of a cancer survivorship plan and is useful in promoting bone health."
