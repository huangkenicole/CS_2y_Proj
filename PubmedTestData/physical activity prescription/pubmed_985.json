        "Prescribing rate of antipsychotics in elderly patients with psychiatric illnesses has been increasing all over the world. However, there is a lack of research examining the use of antipsychotics at psychiatric hospitals. We aim to find out long-term trends in antipsychotic prescriptions and factors associated with the use of antipsychotics in the elderly population. All outpatient visits with patients aged over 65\u2009years between 2006 and 2015 in a psychiatric hospital were included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical data, including patient age, sex, National Health Insurance status, psychiatric diagnosis and antipsychotic prescription, were retrieved through the electronic medical information system. In this study, we found that prescribing rate of antipsychotics has increased around 5.07% through the study period (from 57.25% in 2006 to 60.15% in 2015, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Among all antipsychotics, there was an increase in the use of second-generation antipsychotics with a simultaneous decline in the use of first-generation antipsychotics. Logistic regression analysis showed advanced age, female gender and certification for catastrophic illnesses were positively associated with the use of antipsychotics. Furthermore, patients most likely to be prescribed an antipsychotic were those with psychotic disorders, followed by dementia, and then affective or neurotic disorders. The results of this study were consistent with the worldwide trend of increasing prescriptions of second-generation antipsychotics among elderly patients with psychiatric illnesses. Despite the potential benefits of these medications on certain psychiatric symptoms, clinicians need to exercise due caution as they may also cause potentially serious side effects among the elderly population."
