      "AbstractText": [
        "Large changes in spectacle prescription can increase falls risk in older people. We investigated the effect of induced astigmatism (a common cause of distorted or blurred vision in older people) on locomotor stepping patterns to determine whether the orientation of astigmatic changes could have differential effects on gait safety when negotiating steps and stairs.",
        "10 older adults (mean age 76.0\u00b16.4 years) walked up to and stepped onto a raised block whilst wearing their spectacle prescription and when blurred with \u00b13.00D cylinders at axes 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. Gait measurements included foot placement before the block, toe clearance over the block edge and foot placement on the block.",
        "Induced astigmatism with axes at 90\u00b0, providing magnification in the horizontal meridian only, caused no change in stepping pattern. Induced astigmatism with axes at 180\u00b0 caused foot placement changes in the anterior or posterior direction according to whether magnification was positive or negative in the vertical meridian (block perceived higher or lower respectively). Induced astigmatism with axes oblique at 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 (causing the block to be perceived as a parallelogram sloping downwards either to the right or left) caused gait changes in the anterior and posterior, vertical and lateral directions. Changes in lateral foot placement appeared to be an attempt to maintain constant foot clearance levels over the block edge by stepping over the perceived 'lower' side of the 'sloping' block.",
        "Astigmatic changes with oblique axes had the greatest effect on gait. Clinicians, including optometrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and nurses should counsel older patients about the effects of astigmatism on gait safety. Furthermore, partial prescribing of astigmatic corrections should be considered to reduce the risk of falling."
