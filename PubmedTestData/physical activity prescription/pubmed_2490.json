        "Antenatal physical exercise has roles in health maintenance, prevention, and treatment of disease for pregnant women and fetuses. Different organizations and medical institutions prescribe regular physical exercise during the antenatal period. Despite this, the pregnant populations are less active and decrease their exercise levels during pregnancy than in their non-pregnant state. Therefore, this study aimed to assess antenatal physical exercise level and its associated factors among pregnant women in Hawassa city, Sidama regional state, Ethiopia.",
        "Institutional based cross-sectional study design was employed, and 600 study participants were interviewed using a systematic sampling technique from 25th September/2021 to 25th November/2021. Data entry was made using Epi-Data software version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. A bivariate logistic regression assessed the association between each independent variable and the outcome variable. Explanatory variables with a p-value of less than 0.25 were a candidate for the multivariable logistic regression. Finally, variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were declared as statistically significant and reported with their AOR and 95% CI.",
        "In this study, 25.5% of pregnant women had an adequate practice of antenatal physical exercise while 43.7% of pregnant women had an adequate level of knowledge on antenatal physical exercise An adequate practice of women's antenatal exercise is more likely to occur in women who are exposed to mass media (AOR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.57, 3.78), Husband college and above educational level (AOR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.05, 6.12), having an adequate level of knowledge (AOR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.13, 3.37), and have of supporting facility (AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.49, 3.51).",
        "In this study, three fourth of the study participants had an inadequate level of practice in antenatal physical exercise than the global standard. It shall be beneficial if the city health administration works towards improving pregnant women's knowledge and practice level on physical exercise by providing information using different media outlets. Healthcare providers should broadcast antenatal physical exercise prescriptions in integration with health-related programs."
