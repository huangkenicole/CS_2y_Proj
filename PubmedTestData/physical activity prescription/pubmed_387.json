        "This qualitative study was part of a broader randomized controlled trial which showed that written exercise advice (green prescription) from a general practitioner (GP) increased physical activity levels among sedentary patients more than verbal advice alone over a 6-week period.",
        "To assess the attitudes and perceptions of GPs towards the practice of writing green prescriptions.",
        "Participating GPs (n = 25) discussed attitudes and perceptions towards green prescriptions through structured focus groups within 2 weeks of the end of recruitment for the main study.",
        "The GPs felt comfortable discussing and prescribing exercise with and to patients. They preferred giving green prescriptions to giving verbal advice alone, and felt they were a valuable tool to formalize and document mutually agreed exercise goals. Time constraints were identified as a major barrier to the widespread implementation of green prescriptions. Appropriate training, resource materials, and patient follow-up mechanisms were identified as important elements for successful implementation of the strategy.",
        "Overall, the GPs were very positive about the green prescription concept, believing it to be beneficial for patients and achievable within general practice."
