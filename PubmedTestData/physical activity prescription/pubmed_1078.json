        "Regular physical activity (PA) practice is a way to combat cardiovascular disease, and a PA interventional program, including individualized prescription of walking with limited supervision of execution, may be a strategy to be applied in public parks. Thus, our study tested the effects of a real-world program like this on cardiovascular risk and cardiorespiratory fitness (CF) of the users of a public park.",
        "Data came from the Exercise and Heart Project, a real-life park-based PA interventional program. The study phases were 1) a preintervention evaluation; 2) the individualized prescription of PA; 3) the supervision of the first practice sessions; 4) the unsupervised execution of the prescription; and 5) a postintervention evaluation.",
        "Data from 152 participants (mainly women and aged 40 to 80 years) were analyzed. The intervention significantly increased CF (mean [standard deviation], 99 [19] steps vs 110 [21] steps, P < .001) and reduced body mass index, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure, decreasing global cardiovascular risk (mean [standard deviation], 0.15 [2.84] vs -0.52 [2.60]; P < .001). The effects of intervention on cardiovascular risk were not different between the participants with low and high initial CF or PA levels.",
        "The proposed real-life park-based PA interventional program decreased cardiovascular risk of the participants independently of their initial PA or CF levels."
