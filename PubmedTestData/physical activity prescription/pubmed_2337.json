        "The purpose of this study is to argue for teaching kinesiology for medical students. To become familiar with the basics of the science of human motions is essential for the medical practice. There is substantial evidence that regular physical exercise is beneficial to improve health and prevent disease, and has a key place among the strategies in therapy and rehabilitation. However, before prescription of exercise programmes the physician must take into consideration all the benefits and risks of that exercise. The present curriculum offers insufficient information about the physiological effects and physiologically essential limits of physical exercise. Therefore, a regular study of human motions is required by the medical practice. The need for such education is also shown by the everlasting interest of medical students in credit courses of kinesiology and sports physiology."
