        "To study the role of exercise in asthma management in children and formulate exercise prescriptions for asthmatic children.",
        "A total of 112 asthmatic children aged 7-14 years were randomized into control group (n=56, with medications only) and exercise group (n=56, with medications and exercise prescription) for a trial lasting for 4 months. An asthma diary was used for all children to record the morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score, use of short-acting beta agonists, participation in physical activity, and exercise-induced asthma symptoms.",
        "Of the 112 children, 5 dropped out before the trial completion. From the 13th week, PEF variation in exercise group was significantly lowered compared to that in the control group (P<0.05). Upon the completion of the trial, the daytime and nighttime symptoms score and emergency medication score were all significantly lower in the exercise group than in the control group (P<0.05). No severe adverse events occurred in the children during the trial.",
        "Exercise for no less than 20 min, 3 days a week for 4 months is safe and beneficial for asthma control in children."
