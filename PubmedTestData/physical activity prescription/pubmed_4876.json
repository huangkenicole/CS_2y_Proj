        "To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an mHealth, home-based exercise intervention among stage II-III colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors within 5-years post-resection and adjuvant therapy.",
        "This pilot randomized controlled trial of a 12-week mHealth, home-based exercise intervention, randomly assigned CRC survivors to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) prescription. The following assessments were carried out at baseline and end-of-study (EOS): handgrip strength, short physical performance battery (SPPB), PROMIS physical function, neuropathy total symptom score-6 (NTSS-6), Utah early neuropathy scale (UENS), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, anthropometrics, and body composition via BOD POD, modified Godin leisure-time activity questionnaire. Feasibility, as defined by number of completed prescribed workouts and rate of adherence to individualized heart rate (HR) training zones, was evaluated at EOS. Acceptability was assessed by open-ended surveys at EOS. Descriptive statistics were generated for participant characteristics and assessment data.",
        "Seven participants were included in this pilot study (MICE: n = 5, HIIT: n = 2). Median age was 39 years (1st quartile: 36, 3rd quartile: 50). BMI was 27.4 kg/m2 (1st quartile: 24.5, 3rd quartile: 29.7). Most participants had stage III CRC (71%, n = 5). We observed an 88.6% workout completion rate, 100% retention rate, no adverse events, and qualitative data indicating improved quality of life and positive feedback related to ease of use, accountability, motivation, and autonomy. Mean adherence to HR training zones was 95.7% in MICE, and 28.9% for the high-intensity intervals and 51.0% for the active recovery intervals in HIIT; qualitative results revealed that participants wanted to do more/work-out harder.",
        "An mHealth, home-based delivered exercise intervention, including a HIIT prescription, among stage II-III CRC survivors' post-resection and adjuvant therapy was tolerable and showed trends towards acceptability."
