        "This study aimed to investigate the dose- and intensity-response associations between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in older adults. Multivariable linear regression was performed to evaluate the associations among 3,559 older adults in 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. LTPA was negatively associated with inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, segmented neutrophil count and alkaline phosphatase, and positively associated with one marker of antioxidants albumin in older adults. Compared with vigorous LTPA, moderate LTPA could provide more benefits through further decreasing white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase, and increasing serum bilirubin and albumin. The effects of LTPA on C-reactive protein and albumin were more significant in participants with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the dose- and intensity-response effects of LTPA on inflammation and oxidative stress and provides exercise prescription recommendations for older adults."
