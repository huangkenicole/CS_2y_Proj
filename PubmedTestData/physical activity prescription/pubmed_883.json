      "AbstractText": [
        "Law enforcement agencies generally employ the \"one-size-fits-all\" education-training model. Its effectiveness compared to alternative training models has been under scrutiny. Physical fitness scores of Serbian male (n = 98) and female (n = 79) police cadets during their yearly evaluation were compared. Cadets trained for the first 3 years with the \"one-size-fits-all\" model. In the fourth year, they self-prescribed an individualized exercise program based on the obtained curriculum knowledge. A two-way MANOVA revealed a significant effect of academic years on combined variables (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and significant differences between academic years for deadlift, half squat, standing long jump, sit-ups and 12-min Cooper test time (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Sex also had a significant main effect on combined variables (<i>p</i> < 0.001) with males outscoring females on all of the fitness assessments. For pull-ups, there was a significant year * sex interaction (<i>p</i> = 0.01) with the third year to be pivotal for female and male performance, respectively. In conclusion, the use of a \"one-size-fits-all\" model, presented differences in physical fitness scores between the years one to three, pointing to its questionable effectiveness. On the contrary, the self-prescribed individualized exercise program of the fourth year elicited greater fitness scores, indicating the need to evaluate the applicability of such a training model more."
