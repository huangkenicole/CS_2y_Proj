      "AbstractText": [
        "Although the American Heart Association/American College of Sports Medicine's Preparticipation Questionnaire (AAPQ) is a recommended preexercise cardiovascular screening tool, it has never been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this research is to provide preliminary evidence of its effectiveness among adults aged \u226540 years.",
        "Under the assumption that participants would respond to AAPQ items as they responded to a general health survey, we calculated the sex- and age-specific proportions of adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001 to 2004 who would receive a recommendation for physician consultation based on AAPQ referral criteria. Additionally, we compared recommended AAPQ referrals to a similar assessment using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire in the study sample. AAPQ referral proportions were higher with older age. Across all age groups \u226540 years, 95.5% (94.3% to 96.8%) of women and 93.5% (92.2% to 94.7%) of men in the United States would be advised to consult a physician before exercise. Prescription medication use and age were the most commonly selected items. When referral based on AAPQ was compared with that of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, the 2 screening tools produced similar results for 72.4% of respondents.",
        "These results suggest that >90% of US adults aged \u226540 years would receive a recommendation for physician consultation by the AAPQ. Excessive referral may present an unnecessary barrier to exercise adoption and stress the healthcare infrastructure."
