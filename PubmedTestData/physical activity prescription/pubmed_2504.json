        "To compare methods of relative intensity prescription for their ability to normalise performance (i.e., time to exhaustion), physiological, and perceptual responses to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) between individuals.",
        "Sixteen male and two female cyclists (age: 38\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u00a0years, height: 177\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0cm, body mass: 71.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9\u00a0kg, maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]O<sub>2max</sub>): 54.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u00a0ml\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) initially undertook an incremental test to exhaustion, a 3\u00a0min all-out test, and a 20\u00a0min time-trial to determine prescription benchmarks. Then, four HIIT sessions (4\u00a0min on, 2\u00a0min off) were each performed to exhaustion at: the work rate associated with the gas exchange threshold ([Formula: see text]<sub>GET</sub>) plus 70% of the difference between [Formula: see text]<sub>GET</sub> and the work rate associated with [Formula: see text]O<sub>2max</sub>; 85% of the maximal work rate of the incremental test (85%[Formula: see text]<sub>max</sub>); 120% of the mean work rate of the 20\u00a0min time-trial (120%TT); and the work rate predicted to expend, in 4\u00a0min, 80% of the work capacity above critical power. Acute HIIT responses were modelled with participant as a random effect to provide estimates of inter-individual variability.",
        "For all dependent variables, the magnitude of inter-individual variability was high, and confidence intervals overlapped substantially, indicating that the relative intensity normalisation methods were similarly poor. Inter-individual coefficients of variation for time to exhaustion varied from 44.2% (85%[Formula: see text]<sub>max</sub>) to 59.1% (120%TT), making it difficult to predict acute HIIT responses for an individual.",
        "The present study suggests that the methods of intensity prescription investigated do not normalise acute responses to HIIT between individuals."
