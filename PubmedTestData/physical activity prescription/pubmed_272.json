        "Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and an independent predictor of mortality. The prevalence of hypertension has doubled in the last two decades and evidence suggests that almost half the individuals are unaware of their condition. The antihypertensive effects of exercise are now undisputable, and exercise training is recommended by the major professional and scientific societies, including the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), as first-line treatment to prevent, treat, and control hypertension. This review aims to overview the evidence supporting the current ACSM Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type exercise recommendations for hypertension, discuss new and emerging evidence on exercise in the treatment of hypertension from our laboratories; and propose future directions of research integrating this new and emerging evidence."
