        "International guidelines for pre-participation screening of masters/leisure athletes to identify those that require medical assessment exist, but have not been implemented in mass-community based sports events. We determined the prevalence of runners who, according to these guidelines, would require a medical assessment before participating in a distance running event.",
        "Participants of the 2012 Two Oceans races (21.1 and 56\u00a0km) in South Africa (n\u00a0=\u00a015,778) completed an online pre-race medical screening questionnaire using European pre-participation screening guidelines. We determined the prevalence of runners that would require a pre-race medical assessment, based on risk factors, symptoms, and disease.",
        "The pre-participation \"self assessment of risk\" screening identified 4,941 runners (31.3%; 95% CI 30.6-32.0) that would need to undergo a full pre-participation medical assessment prior to running, if the current pre-participation screening guidelines are applied. Although musculoskeletal complaints and prescription medication use were the main triggers for a medical assessment, 16.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a02657) runners should undergo medical evaluation for suspected cardiac disease based on the questionnaire results: 3.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a0538) reporting existing CVD (very high risk) and 13.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a02119) reporting multiple CVD risk factors (high risk). Other possible risk factors were reported as follows: history of chronic diseases (respiratory\u00a0=\u00a013.1%, gastro-intestinal\u00a0=\u00a04.3%, nervous system\u00a0=\u00a03.8%, metabolic/endocrine\u00a0=\u00a03.5%, allergies\u00a0=\u00a013.9%); chronic prescription medication\u00a0=\u00a014.8%, used medication before or during races\u00a0=\u00a015.6%; past history of collapse during a race\u00a0=\u00a01.4%.",
        "Current guidelines identified that >\u00a030% runners would require a full medical assessment before race participation - mainly linked to runners reporting musculoskeletal conditions. We suggest a revision of guidelines and propose that pre-race screening should be considered to identify runners with a \"very high,\" \"high,\" and \"intermediate risk\" for medical complications during exercise. Pre-race screening and educational intervention could be implemented to reduce medical complications during exercise."
