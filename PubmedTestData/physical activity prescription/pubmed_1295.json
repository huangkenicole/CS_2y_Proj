        "Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak leading to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has become a global pandemic. Patients with Cystic fibrosis are considered of major risk, as respiratory tract infections are more severe than in the general population, with a higher risk of complications and a negative impact on lung function. The performance of physical exercise is considered as key for its well-known general benefits and also as a complementary method to help airway clearance. Therefore, physical exercise is also considered as key in the therapeutic strategy during the quarantine period. However, the impossibility to perform exercise with appropriate prescription and monitoring is of considerable worry to health care professionals. Thus, alternative strategies, such as online measures to monitor this therapy and, consequently, to achieve a safe and effective dose are highly needed. Exercise regimens should include strength and endurance, as well as balance and flexibility exercises. Patients are highly encouraged to participate in exercise programs to maintain fitness and exercise should be continued during the quarantine period. This commentary provides a summary of the main effects and benefits of physical exercise, as well as the main recommendations for its adequate execution, including exercise modality, frequency, intensity, and volume."
