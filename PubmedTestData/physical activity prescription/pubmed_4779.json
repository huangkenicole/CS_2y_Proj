        "To assess the difference of pre- and post-training performance evaluation of continuing medical education (CME) courses in cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) management among physicians at primary health care facilities of Armenian regions we conducted an evaluation survey. 212 medical records were surveyed on assessment of performance before and after the training courses through a self-employed structured questionnaire. Analysis of survey revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in a number of variables: threefold increased recording of lipids and body mass index (p = 0.001); moderate increased recording of comorbidities and aspirin prescription (p < 0.012); eightfold increased recording of dyslipidemia management plan, twofold increased recording for CVD management plan and fivefold increased recording for CVD absolute risk (p = 0.000). Missing records of electrocardiography and urine/creatinine analyses decreased statistically significantly (p < 0.05). Statistically significant decrease was observed in prescription of thiazides and angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (p < 0.005), while prescription of statins and statins with diet for dyslipidemia management showed increased recording (p < 0.05). Similarly, we observed increased records for counseling of rehabilitation physical activity (p = 0.006). In this survey most differences in pre- and post-evaluation of performance assessment may be explained by improved and interactive training modes, more advanced methods of demonstration of modeling. Current findings may serve a basis for future planning of CME courses for physicians of remote areas facing challenges in upgrading their knowledge, as well as expand the experience of performance assessment along with evaluation of knowledge scores."
