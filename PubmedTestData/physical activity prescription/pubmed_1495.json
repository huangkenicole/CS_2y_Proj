      "AbstractText": [
        "Many older adults take at least one prescription medication with anticholinergic (ACH) activity, which can impact the central nervous system and can lead to cognitive decline and impairment especially in an aging population susceptible to cognitive changes. We examined this relationship between ACH burden and cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. We further determined if increased activity levels mitigated the relationships between ACH burden and cognition.",
        "Data from The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke project were used. We included 20,575 adults aged \u226545\u2009years with longitudinal cognitive testing. The anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale was used to assess for ACH use and overall burden. Cognitive data included an overall composite score, a memory, and verbal fluency composites. Mixed effects models were conducted to determine if cognitive function worsened over time for participants with higher ACB (>3) scores. The full model adjusted for age, sex, race, education, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia, self-reported physical activity (PA) and depressive symptoms.",
        "A significant relationship between ACH burden and composite cognitive scores was found (p\u00a0=\u2009<0.001), with those with higher ACB showing more rapid cognitive decline over time. There was an effect of age for participants with higher ACB (>3) scores and ACB as a continuous variable. Baseline PA level was associated with less cognitive decline over time and this effect was greater in older cohorts.",
        "We observed an effect of ACHs on cognition in adults \u226545\u2009years old that worsened with age. ACH users showed more cognitive effects, whereas PA emerged as a possible mitigating factor."
