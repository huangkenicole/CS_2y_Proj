        "The body of literature on tendinopathy management has come a long way in the last few decades and a variety of changes in the clinical approach have emerged from this research. One particular approach that shows promise has been called \"heavy slow resistance\" (HSR), and this has been the subject of investigation in a number of randomized controlled trials. While the premise for this approach is defensible, a critical examination of the implementation of these HSR protocols results in some concerns when compared to basic exercise science principles. This article lays out some considerations that will help future investigators to improve their exercise prescription approaches in this area."
