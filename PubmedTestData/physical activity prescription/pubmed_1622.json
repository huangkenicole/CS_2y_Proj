        "We investigated the link between enhancement of SI (by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and muscle metabolites after 12 weeks of aerobic (high-intensity interval training [HIIT]), resistance training (RT), or combined training (CT) exercise in 52 lean healthy individuals. Muscle RNA sequencing revealed a significant association between SI after both HIIT and RT and the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolic pathway. Concurrently with increased expression and activity of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase enzyme, many muscle amino metabolites, including BCAAs, glutamate, phenylalanine, aspartate, asparagine, methionine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, increased with HIIT, supporting the substantial impact of HIIT on amino acid metabolism. Short-chain C3 and C5 acylcarnitines were reduced in muscle with all three training modes, but unlike RT, both HIIT and CT increased tricarboxylic acid metabolites and cardiolipins, supporting greater mitochondrial activity with aerobic training. Conversely, RT and CT increased more plasma membrane phospholipids than HIIT, suggesting a resistance exercise effect on cellular membrane protection against environmental damage. Sex and age contributed modestly to the exercise-induced changes in metabolites and their association with cardiometabolic parameters. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses suggest various clusters of genes and metabolites are involved in distinct effects of HIIT, RT, and CT. These distinct metabolic signatures of different exercise modes independently link each type of exercise training to improved SI and cardiometabolic risk.",
        "We aimed to understand the link between skeletal muscle metabolites and cardiometabolic health after exercise training. Although aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise training each enhance muscle insulin sensitivity as well as other cardiometabolic parameters, they disparately alter amino and citric acid metabolites as well as the lipidome, linking these metabolomic changes independently to the improvement of cardiometabolic risks with each exercise training mode. These findings reveal an important layer of the unique exercise mode-dependent changes in muscle metabolism, which may eventually lead to more informed exercise prescription for improving SI."
