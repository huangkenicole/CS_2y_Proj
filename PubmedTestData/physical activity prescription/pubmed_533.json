        "This study aimed to test experiential and behavioral processes of change as mediators of the prediction of exercise behavior by two self-regulation traits, self-efficacy and self-motivation, while controlling for exercise enjoyment.",
        "Structural equation modeling was applied to questionnaire responses obtained from a diverse sample of participants. Objective measures defined adherence (928 of 1,279 participants attended 80\u00a0% or more of sessions) and compliance (867 of 1,145 participants exercised 30\u00a0min or more each session at their prescribed heart rate).",
        "Prediction of attendance by self-efficacy (inversely) and self-motivation was direct and also indirect, mediated through positive relations with the typical use of behavioral change processes. Enjoyment and self-efficacy (inversely) predicted compliance with the exercise prescription.",
        "The results support the usefulness of self-regulatory behavioral processes of the transtheoretical model for predicting exercise adherence, but not compliance, extending the supportive evidence for self-regulation beyond self-reports of physical activity used in prior observational studies."
