        "An under-explored strategy for increasing physical activity is the dietary treatment of obesity, but empirical evidence is lacking.",
        "We aimed to compare the effects of weight loss via severe as opposed to moderate energy restriction on physical activity over 36 mo.",
        "A total of 101 postmenopausal female adults (45-65 y, BMI 30-40\u00a0kg/m2, <180 min/wk of structured exercise) were randomly assigned to either 12 mo of moderate energy restriction (25%-35% of energy requirement) with a food-based diet, or a severe intervention involving 4 mo of severe energy restriction (65%-75% of energy requirement) with a total meal replacement diet, followed by 8 mo of moderate energy restriction. Physical activity was encouraged, but no tailored or supervised exercise prescription was provided. Physical activity was assessed with an accelerometer worn for 7 d before baseline (0 mo) and 0.25, 1, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 36 mo after intervention commencement.",
        "Compared with the moderate group, the severe group exhibited greater mean: total volume of physical activity; duration of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA); duration of light-intensity physical activity; step counts, as well as lower mean duration of sedentary time. All these differences (except step counts) were apparent at 6 mo [e.g., 1006 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-min/wk; 95% CI: 564, 1449 MET-min/wk for total volume of physical activity], and some were also apparent at 4 and/or 12 mo. There were no differences between groups in the 2 other outcomes investigated (self-efficacy to regulate exercise; and proportion of participants meeting the WHO's 2020 Physical Activity Guidelines for MVPA). When the analyses were adjusted for weight at each time point, the differences between groups were either attenuated or abolished.",
        "Among female adults with obesity, including a dietary component to reduce excess body weight-notably one involving severe energy restriction-could potentially enhance the effectiveness of physical activity interventions.This trial was registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12612000651886."
