        "Exercise is safe and effective for those living with and beyond breast cancer, with evidence supporting exercise guidelines, and position statements from international organizations. Despite the clearly recognized benefits of exercise for these individuals, many do not participate or maintain recommended exercise levels throughout the breast cancer continuum, highlighting the lack of translation from research into practice. In addition, discerning how exercise can be tailored to address breast cancer-related impairments, so that individuals are able to participate safely and effectively, has also not been studied extensively. Thus, we propose that implementing exercise screening, triage, and referral pathways across the breast cancer continuum may allow for increased accessibility and adoption among those living with and beyond breast cancer. This paper provides an overview of exercise prescription tailoring for common breast cancer and treatment-related impairments, proposes a simplified screening tool for identifying physical activity and movement-related impairments, and considers how best to channel evidence into practice via proposed implementation pathways that may better connect individuals living with and beyond breast cancer with exercise oncology resources through screening, triage, and referral."
