        "To determine the effect of resistance training during adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in cancer patients on measures of lean mass and muscle strength. Secondary aims were to analyse the prescription and tolerability of supervised resistance training in this population.",
        "EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from inception until 29 March 2021. Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining supervised resistance training > 6 weeks duration during adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in cancer patients with objective measurement of muscle strength and/or lean mass were included. The meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.4.",
        "A total of 1910 participants from 20 articles were included (mean age: 54 years, SD = 10) and the majority were female (76.5%). Resistance training was associated with a significant increase in upper body strength (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79, I2 = 64%, P < 0.0001), lower body strength (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.98, I2 = 91%, P = 0.005), grip strength (mean difference (MD) = 1.32, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.27, I2 = 0%, P < 0.01) and lean mass (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42, I2 = 0%, P = 0.02). A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The quality of the studies included was moderate to high with low risk of bias as per the PEDro scale.",
