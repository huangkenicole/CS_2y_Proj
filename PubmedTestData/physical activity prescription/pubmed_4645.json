        "The prescription is a vital written document communicating between the physician, the patient and the pharmacist. The audit of prescribing pattern is a component of medical audit, which seeks monitoring, evaluation and necessary modifications in the prescribing practices of prescribers to achieve rational and cost effective medical care for the patients, The present drug utilization study was conducted by fourth year MBBs students during their research posting in the department of Pharmacology at B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS), Dharan. The prescriptions were randomly collected from BPKIHS pharmacy over a period of 3 weeks. The auditing was done in the form of a semi structured performa containing the patients particulars with regard to age, sex, and residence, the details of the illness and prescribed drug information. The data was analyzed at the end of the study. The study points out that the maximum (27.5%) prescriptions were from General Outpatient Department (GOPD) followed by ENT (16.5%), Internal medicine (15.5%) and General surgery (10%). This indicates the distribution of patient load in hospital and the dominant areas to be targeted for intervention. Further, the proportion of antimicrobial agents (AMAs) i.e. 26.03% use was low and was prescribed empirically in most of the cases. There was use of expensive AMAs and irrational prescribing of combinations of AMAs in some prescriptions. Other prevailing drugs which were prescribed were analgesics. The usage of nimesulide and rofecoxib. withdrawn by FDA were used recurrently in this setup. There was greater use of dubious drugs of unproven benefit like vitamins, calcium etc. The diagnosis of the disease were not mentioned in 32.5% of prescriptions, The dose, frequency and duration of drugs were unascertained in majority of prescriptions that might lead to health hazards. This exercise might change the behavior of existing prescribers and also of the future doctors."
