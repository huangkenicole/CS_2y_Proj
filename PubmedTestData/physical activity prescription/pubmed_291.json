        "Pillitteri, G, Clemente, FM, Petrucci, M, Rossi, A, Bellafiore, M, Bianco, A, Palma, A, and Battaglia, G. Toward a new conceptual approach to \"intensity\" in soccer player's monitoring: A narrative review. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1896-1911, 2023-In the last decade, monitoring physiological and match-related demands in soccer has become an increasingly common practice in sports sciences. One of the great challenges during monitoring process is the identification of key indicators that permit to generalize evidence and sustain decision-making process during training prescription. Actually, one of the major debates in the scientific community and among practitioners is the identification of the \"intensity\" concept. Defining a given training session or exercise based on \"intensity\" is difficult due to the fact that a huge amount of indicators are available (related both to the performed activities and to the athletes' psychophysiological responses). These indicators can lead to specific outcomes with different interpretations. The current narrative review aims to discuss the different measures approaches used in soccer to describe the intensity for both internal and external demands. In addition, a second purpose of this review is to propose general recommendations for combining intensity indicators with the aim of defining an overall intensity score of a training session or drill."
