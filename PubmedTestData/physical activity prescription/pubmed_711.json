        "To evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) containing a physical training component on physical function and physical activity in stroke rehabilitation.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases for studies published from inception to 12 July 2022. Clinical trials including mHealth apps with a physical training component were included using outcomes of physical function and physical activity. Quality of life was extracted as a secondary outcome.",
        "Five RCTs, two non-RCTs, and four uncontrolled clinical trials were included with a total of 264 stroke survivors. Eleven apps were identified with a physical training component using features of gamification (six apps), exercise prescription (three apps), and physical activity (two apps). Six out of seven studies reported statistically significant improvements in physical function in favor of the experimental group, with the most robust findings for upper extremity function. For physical activity, statistically significant improvements were seen in the experimental groups. Only one study showed significant improvement in quality of life. Overall study quality was fair.",
        "mHealth apps containing a physical training component are promising for physical function and physical activity in stroke rehabilitation. Further research is warranted to confirm these conclusions.Implications for rehabilitationDesign content of mobile apps with a physical training component were focused on gamification, exercise prescription, and physical activityUsing mobile app-delivered therapy seem promising for improving upper extremity function in stroke rehabilitationUsing mobile apps also supported an increase of physical activity in people with strokeStudies using mobile apps should report more specifically the dosage of physical training and adherenceUsing mobile apps seems promising as an additional tool for clinical work, however, more studies are required to understand their effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation."
