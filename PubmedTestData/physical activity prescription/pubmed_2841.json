        "<b>Purpose:</b> Heart rate variability (HRV) has gained acceptance as a key marker of cardiovascular health. We compared HRV responses after continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CMIE) and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) matched for intensity and duration in individuals with midspectrum chronic kidney disease (CKD). <b>Methods:</b> Twenty men and women (age 62.0\u00a0\u00b1 10\u00a0yrs.) diagnosed with CKD stages G3a and G3b participated in a 2 (condition) x 4 (time point) repeated cross-over measures design study. HRV time-domain indices were based on the standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD) and frequency domain. High-frequency (HF), low-frequency (LF), total power (TP) were examined. CMIE consisted of treadmill walking for 30\u00a0minutes at a 2% incline and speed corresponding to 60%-65% of reserve volume of oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>R). HIIE included five intervals of 3\u00a0minutes at 90% of VO<sub>2</sub>R and 2\u00a0minutes at 20% VO<sub>2</sub>R intervals. Conditions were designed to be of the same average intensity (60% to 65% of VO<sub>2</sub>R) and caloric expenditure (~144 kcal). <b>Results:</b> Immediately following exercise SDNN, RMSSD, HF, LF, and TP were significantly lower compared to before exercise (<i>p</i> <.05). HRV responses were not different between conditions and conditions X time (<i>p</i> >.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Thirty minutes of either CMIE or HIIE decreased HRV indices, pointing to an autonomic imbalance favoring vagal mediation. HRV's responses regarding HIIE were no different from CMIE, therefore, from an autonomic function point of view this similarity may be useful for CKD exercise prescription and programming."
