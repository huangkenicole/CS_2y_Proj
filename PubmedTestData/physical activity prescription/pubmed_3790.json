        "The characteristics of body type, serum lipids and blood pressure in male blue workers were evaluated. The subjects were 1,705 healthy men aged 40.3 +/- 4.33 years, and were classified into 4 groups according to body mass index: BMI; lean (group L: BMI < 20), normal (group N: 20 < or = BMI < 24), mildly obese (group MO: BMI 24 to 26.5) and obese group (group O: BMI > 26.5). The physical characteristics, blood pressure and 14 blood constituent items were measured. Groups L, N, MO and O accounted for 8.5, 53.4, 28.6, and 9.4% of all subjects, that is the obese body type (MO and O groups) occupied 38%. Rest systolic and diastolic blood pressure were positively related to BMI. Most blood constituent items biochemically analyzed increased in proportion to BMI values. The Trigriceride level was 88.5, 112.2, 152.8 and 171.9 mg/dl in groups L, N, MO and O, respectively. The Trigriceride level in groups MO and O were about the upper limit of the normal range. The total cholesterol level was in the normal range in 4 groups, but was higher in the MO and O groups than in groups L and N. The HDL-cholesterol level was low in inverse proportion to BMI, that is 58.2, 51.3, 47.6, and 42.6 mg/dl in groups L, N, MO, and O, respectively. Especially the values in group O were similar to the values in the aged and adult disease patients. A greater percentage of Japanese male workers were obese men and they risked developing atherosclerosis and adult diseases. the present study suggests that health education regarding exercise prescription and nutrition intake in daily life should be provided."
