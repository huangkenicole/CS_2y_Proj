        "Mat Pilates has become an attractive alternative exercise among older women, however, despite knowing the importance of regular exercise, interrupting training is a common issue in this population. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of 6-weeks of detraining after a period of 12-weeks of training with Mat Pilates on the functional capacity and neuromuscular performance of the knee extensor muscles in older women. Ten older women (62.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 years; 1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0m height; 69.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00a0kg; 27.8\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> body mass index) volunteered to participate in this study. The study was divided into three periods: a 4-week control period, followed by 12 weeks of Mat Pilates intervention, and a 6-week detraining period. During the intervention, the results showed significant improvements in functional capacity tests (time up and go, time up stairs, time down stairs, and chair sit-and-reach), rate of torque development, and impulse (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After the detraining period, a decrease was observed in the chair sit-and-reach test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and contractile impulse at intervals 0-30 and 0-50\u00a0ms (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We conclude that a 6-week detraining period after a Mat Pilates training protocol was sufficient to cause declines in the chair sit-and-reach test and in the contractile impulse of the knee extensors in the early phase of the torque-time curve (0-30 and 0-50\u00a0ms), but not in the other functional capacity tests and neuromuscular parameters evaluated."
