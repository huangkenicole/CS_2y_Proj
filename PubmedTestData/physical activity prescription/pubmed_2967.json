        "This study identified the knowledge base and practices of Registered Nurse, Certified Diabetes Educators (RN, CDEs) regarding their exercise teaching programs for elderly clients who have non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The random sample of 197 AADE members surveyed by questionnaire was a highly educated and experienced group. RN, CDEs who worked 30 or more hours per week in diabetes education or attended four or more continuing education (CE) programs per year had significantly more comprehensive exercise teaching program designs and instructional techniques to enhance elderly NIDDM clients' learning (P < .05). However, many CDEs do not teach their elderly clients about exercise due to lack of resources, lack of specific knowledge to prescribe exercise,and negative stereotypes of elderly clients' ability to exercise. Greater availability of educational programs for CDEs to explore curriculum development, program planning, evaluation, and exercise prescription for elderly clients with multisystem disease is recommended."
