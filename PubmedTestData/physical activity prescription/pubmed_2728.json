        "Knee valgus alignment has been associated with lower-limb musculoskeletal injury. This case-control study aims to: assess biomechanical differences between patients with patellar tendinopathy and healthy controls.",
        "43 military participants (21 cases, 22 controls) were recorded using 3D-motion capture performing progressively demanding, small knee bend, single leg and single leg decline squats. Planned a priori analysis of peak: hip adduction, knee flexion, pelvic tilt, pelvic obliquity and trunk flexion was conducted using MANOVA. Kinematic and kinetic data were graphed with bootstrapped t-tests and 95% CI's normalised to the squat cycle. ANOVA and correlations in SPSS were used for exploratory analysis.",
        "On their symptomatic side cases squatted to less depth (-6.62\u00b0, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) than controls with exploratory curve analysis revealing a pattern of increased knee valgus collapse throughout the squatting movement (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Greater patella tendon force was generated by: the eccentric than concentric phase of squatting (+30-43%, ES 0.52-1.32, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), declined (plantarflexed) compared to horizontal surface (+36-51%, ES 1.19-1.68, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and deeper knee flexion angles (F\u202f\u2265\u202f658.3, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) with no difference between groups (F\u202f\u2264\u202f1.380, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Cases experienced more pain on testing on decline board (ES\u202f=\u202f0.69, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). For symptomatic limbs pain (r<sub>s</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.458-0.641, p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05), but not VISA-P (Victoria Institute of Sport Assessment) (r<sub>s</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.053-0.090, p\u202f>\u202f0.05), correlated with extensor knee moment.",
        "Knee valgus alignment is a plausible risk factor for patellar tendinopathy. Conclusions relating to causation are limited by the cross-sectional study design. Increasing squat depth, use of a declined surface and isolating the eccentric phase enable progression of loading prescription guided by pain."
