        "Exercise is an efficacious intervention for mental and physical health, but few studies have identified the additive benefits of exercise prescriptions for those undergoing empirically supported psychosocial treatment. Behavioral activation (BA) involves completing activities to improve mood, an ideal format for exercise augmentation. The purpose of this study was to examine the credibility and exploratory effect size estimates of augmenting BA with exercise. Thirty-one sedentary, depressed patients were randomized to receive nine sessions of BA+exercise or BA+stretching over 12 weeks. Monthly assessments of depression, quality of life, distress intolerance (DI), perceived stress, and exercise were conducted. Results demonstrated strong credibility and completion rates of BA+exercise, comparable to other PA interventions. Randomization did not contribute to differential exercise between conditions; all participants engaged in more exercise over time. Similarly, all participants significantly improved on all outcomes over time. Condition differences emerged for DI and perceived stress; the exercise condition evidenced greater improvements over time. Participants who engaged in more exercise also evidenced greater and faster declines in depression. BA may be a useful strategy for improving depression and increasing exercise. Additional explicit exercise prescriptions may not be necessary to improve depression but may be helpful for DI and stress.
