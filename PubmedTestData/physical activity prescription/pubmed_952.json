        "The present review highlights current research on the importance of PA and fitness for patients with heart failure and recommendations with respect to heart failure phenotypes and special populations. Furthermore, the evidence for various exercise types and intensities/doses as an \"exercise prescription\", are discussed. The strong association between heart failure and traditional risk factors, physical inactivity and low fitness, underlines the importance of regular PA and exercise for prevention and treatment of heart failure. This is illustrated by cardiac stiffness which typically accelerates in middle-life and could be reversed by aerobic exercise. In patients with HFpEF, regular PA counteracts many of the changes observed, both metabolic and functional. Indeed, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has received a class 1A recommendation in current guidelines [1], in order to improve functional capacity, quality of life and lower the risk of rehospitalization. An individually tailored plan based on risk stratification, clinical assessment and cardiopulmonary exercise testing is encouraged before initiation of exercise training in patients with heart failure. In general, a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training protocols is recommended (Table 1) [2], preferably throughout life. More studies are needed, regarding the role of PA and exercise in specific populations, such as frail patients with heart failure."
