        "Years after the initial onset of poliomyelitis, patients often report new problems, including fatigue, weakness, pain, breathing difficulty, decreased endurance, problems with swallowing, choking, increased sensitivity to cold, and psychological problems. The premise of this article is that underlying pathophysiology of these problems can be assessed on the basis of a detailed history, a multisystem physical examination, and supplemental information provided by investigative tests. The indications for treatment of the late sequelae of poliomyelitis based on the underlying pathophysiology and the rationale for treatment prescription are explored. Possible outcomes of the assessment include no intervention; prescription of a balance between activity and rest, a reduction in activity, or an increase in activity; interventions to improve postural alignment, prescription of orthoses, and weight control; prescription of walking aids and mobility devices; respiratory care; lifestyle modification; or some combination of these outcomes. If treatment can be directed at the underlying causes of the late sequelae, the possibility of reducing further deterioration and of optimizing function in these patients will likely be enhanced."
