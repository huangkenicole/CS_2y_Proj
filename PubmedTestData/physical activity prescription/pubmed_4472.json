        "Conduct a scoping review to identify and map the literature that has evaluated the effects of health promotion interventions aimed at physical activity and/or dietary behavior, implemented by the occupational health services.",
        "A search for peer-reviewed articles was conducted (up to February 2013) through electronic databases, hand searching of key journals, and reference lists. A methodological quality assessment was performed.",
        "Fourteen studies were included, describing 10 interventions. The main component was counseling of individuals with known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Intervention effects were reported for dietary behavior, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and biological risk factors.",
        "Results are promising, especially with regard to interventions containing counseling targeting individuals at risk. High-quality studies using objective measures to assess behavioral outcomes and the (cost)-effectiveness of interventions containing counseling, PA on prescription, and multilevel interventions are needed."
