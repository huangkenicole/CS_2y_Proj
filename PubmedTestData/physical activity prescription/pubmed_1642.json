        "This study aimed to compare the V[Combining Dot Above]O2max and first and second ventilatory threshold (1stVT and 2ndVT) V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) responses of treadmill running (TR) with those of 3 water aerobic exercises: stationary running (SR), jumping jack (JJ), and forward kick (FK). Nine women (22.89 \u00b1 1.81 years, 1.66 \u00b1 0.07 m, 58.46 \u00b1 4.19 kg) performed 1 maximal test session for each of the 4 exercise protocols in a randomized order to determine the V[Combining Dot Above]O2max and V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values and RPE responses corresponding with the 1stVT and 2ndVT. V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values were also expressed as a percentage of V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (%V[Combining Dot Above]O2max). A repeated measures analysis of variance and Bonferroni's post hoc test were used, with \u03b1 = 0.05 denoting statistical significance. The analyses showed that the V[Combining Dot Above]O2 responses were significantly higher for TR than for the other exercises at all effort intensities (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max: p < 0.001; 1stVT and 2ndVT V[Combining Dot Above]O2: p < 0.001), followed by intermediate responses for SR and FK and lower responses for JJ. However, no significant differences between exercises for values of %V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (1stVT: p = 0.099; 2ndVT: p = 0.131) and RPE (1stVT: p = 0.275; 2ndVT: p = 0.477) were found at submaximal intensities, indicating that it is possible to achieve and maintain the same training intensity with these exercises during a typical water fitness lesson. Moreover, the RPE values obtained for the 1stVT and 2ndVT can make the prescription of intensity for these water exercises for young women more simple and practical."
