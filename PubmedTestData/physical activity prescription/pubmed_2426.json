      "AbstractText": [
        "There is conflicting evidence whether aerobic exercise training (AET) reduces pulse wave velocity (PWV) in adults with and without long-term conditions (LTCs).",
        "To explore whether PWV improves with AET in adults with and without LTC, to quantify the magnitude of any effect and understand the influence of the exercise prescription.",
        "CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were among the databases searched.",
        "We included studies with a PWV measurement before and after supervised AET of at least 3 weeks duration. Exclusion criteria included resistance exercise and alternative measures of arterial stiffness.",
        "Controlled trials were included in a random effects meta-analysis to explore the effect of AET on PWV. Uncontrolled studies were included in a secondary meta-analysis and meta-regression exploring the effect of patient and programme factors on change in PWV. The relevant risk of bias tool was used for each study design.",
        "79 studies (n=3729) were included: 35 controlled studies (21 randomised control trials (RCT) (n=1240) and 12 non-RCT (n=463)) and 44 uncontrolled (n=2026). In the controlled meta- analysis, PWV was significantly reduced following AET (mean (SD) 11 (7) weeks) in adults with and without LTC (mean difference -0.63; 95%\u2009CI -0.82 to -0.44; p<0.0001). PWV was similarly reduced between adults with and without LTC (p<0.001). Age, but not specific programme factors, was inversely associated with a reduction in PWV -0.010 (-0.020 to -0.010) m/s, p<0.001.",
        "Short-term AET similarly reduces PWV in adults with and without LTC. Whether this effect is sustained and the clinical implications require further investigation."
