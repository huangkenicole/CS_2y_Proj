        "There are limited data on therapy selection and switching in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This 18 country, real-world study assessed use and switching of immunomodulatory therapy (biologic/apremilast), the extent of treatment failure and its association with reduced physical functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI).",
        "PsA patients under routine care and their treating physicians provided demographics, current therapy, reasons for switching, duration of first therapy, HRQoL, HAQ-DI, and WPAI. Current immunomodulatory therapy was determined as \"failing\" if, after \u2265\u20093\u00a0months, physician-rated disease severity had worsened, remained severe, was \"unstable/deteriorating,\" or they were dissatisfied with disease control and/or did not consider treatment a \"success.\"",
        "Included were 3714 PsA patients; 1455 (40.6%) had never received immunomodulatory therapy; 1796 (50.1%) had ever received 1 immunomodulatory therapy and 331 (9.2%) \u2265\u20091. Lack of efficacy with first immunomodulatory therapy was the most common reason for switching; patients whose physicians indicated \"primary lack of efficacy\" as the reason, switched after a mean of 9.4\u00a0months. Patients currently failing immunomodulator therapies (n\u2009=\u2009246) had poorer HRQoL compared with treatment success (n\u2009=\u20091472) measured by EQ-5D-3L (0.60 vs 0.77%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001); SF-36 PCS (40.8% vs 46.1%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) MCS (41.1% vs 45.3%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Physical functioning, activity, and work productivity were also more impaired (HAQ-DI: 0.88 vs 0.56; activity impairment: 46.7% vs 29.7%; overall work impairment: 35.4% vs 26.1%; all P\u2009<\u20090.0001).",
        "Poor treatment response in PsA is associated with substantial negative patient impact. In cases of primary treatment failure, timely switching is needed."
