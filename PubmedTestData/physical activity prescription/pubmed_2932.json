        "An estimated 40 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, making it the most common psychiatric disorder in the country. Although the data are conflicting and limited, engaging in or increasing exercise has been proposed for the management of anxiety and other mental health disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a correlation between pre-race anxiety and running experience, sex, body mass index, age, and mental health history using the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-Item screening tool for anxiety. This study was a prospective trial of 403 adult runners who were scheduled to participate in a 5\u00a0K, 10\u00a0K, half marathon, or full marathon race. Each participant completed a survey consisting of epidemiologic variables and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-Item screening tool. Results revealed that the runners with more experience and increased mileage demonstrated a decrease in reported worrying on a daily to near-daily basis; whether this finding correlates with a decreased risk of developing an anxiety disorder has yet to be determined. Based on our findings, exercise as a prescription for the treatment and possibly prevention of anxiety should be considered."
