        "In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that telic dominance is one of the psychological variables that may influence the exercise-affect relationship according to the dual-mode model of exercise and affect (Ekkekakis, 2003). Thirty-three participants with high or low telic dominance rated their affect at 3-min intervals as they ran on a treadmill while the speed was adjusted to maintain their respiratory exchange ratio at a target value of 1.00 +/- 0.02 for a period of 10 min. Compared with baseline scores (which were not statistically different between the two groups), the mean decline in pleasure at the end of the run was twofold greater in participants with high telic dominance. This was observed after having controlled for individual differences in aerobic fitness (as measured by [Vdot]O(2max)). We also detected an earlier onset of decreases in pleasure in high telic dominant participants. Our data extend the burgeoning research on variables influencing one's ability to continue exercising at an imposed intensity that can produce pain or discomfort (i.e. tolerance of exercise intensity). Additionally, results from this study support continued promotion of tailor-made prescriptions for maximizing positive affective outcomes during exercise, which ultimately may lead to increased adherence to an exercise programme."
