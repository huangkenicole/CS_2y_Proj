        "The aim was to explore the effect of using a powered mobility device (PMD) on older peoples' activity, participation and quality of life (QoL).",
        "A pre- and post-intervention design with outcome measures for activity, participation (Individually Prioritized Problem Assessment, IPPA; World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0) and QoL (SF-36) were used. T-test was used to analyse the data. The magnitude of the effects was measured by Cohen's criteria for effect sizes (d).",
        "The sample consisted of 45 individuals (36 men) aged 66-88 years referred for prescription of a PMD. All were prescribed a powered scooter (PS). A statistically significant improvement with a large effect on IPPA in the ICF domains of Self-care (d\u2009=\u20092.47), Domestic life (d\u2009=\u20092.40), Interpersonal interactions and relationships (d\u2009=\u20092.08), and Community, social, and civic life (d\u2009=\u20092.36) was found. Medium-sized improvement on the WHODAS 2.0 domain of Participation and small improvements in the SF-36 domains of Physical Health and Role-Physical were also found.",
        "A PS has significant effects on the areas of activity, participation and QoL in elderly people. These findings have implications for prescriptions of a PS to this population. Implications for Rehabilitation Powered scooter interventions increased the performance of activities and increased participation in elderly people with mobility limitations. Actions from several parts of the community are required to prevent from mishaps from using powered scooters. The Individually Prioritized Problem Assessment is an adequate method to measure goal attainment in elderly users of powered scooters."
