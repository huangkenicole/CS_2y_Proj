        "To test differences in the duration and magnitude of physiological response to isocaloric moderate intensity continuous (MICE) and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) sessions in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).",
        "Academic medical center in Miami, FL, USA.",
        "Ten adult men (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.; 39\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009year old) with chronic (13.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8\u2009year) paraplegia (T2-T10) completed a graded exercise test. Then, in a randomized order, participants completed MICE and HIIE for a cost of 120\u2009kcal. MICE was performed at 24.6% PO<sub>peak</sub>. During HIIE, exercise was completed in 2\u2009min work and recovery phases at 70%:10% PO<sub>peak</sub>.",
        "MICE and HIIE were isocaloric (115.9\u2009\u00b1\u200921.8 and 116.6\u2009\u00b1\u200935.0\u2009kcal, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.903), but differed in duration (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 vs 32.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2\u2009min; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and average respiratory exchange ratio (RER; 0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 vs 1.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07; p\u2009=\u20090.002). During MICE, a workrate of 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7% PO<sub>peak</sub> elicited a V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> of 53.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5% V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub> (10.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009ml\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup>\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>). During HIIE, a workrate at 70% PO<sub>peak</sub> elicited 88.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7% V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub> (16.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\u2009ml\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup>\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>), and 29.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7% of the session was spent at or above 80% V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub>. During HIIE working phase, RER declined from the first to last interval (1.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 vs 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.001), reflecting an initially high but declining glycolytic rate.",
        "Compared with MICE, HIIE imposed a greater physiological stimulus while requiring less time to achieve a target caloric expenditure. Thus, exercise intensity might be an important consideration in the tailoring of exercise prescription to address the cardiometabolic comorbidities of SCI."
