        "The dominant outcome from exercise prescription is an increase in various markers of exercise capacity. A very large group of studies have demonstrated that the VO2max is increased in response to exercise performed according to well-accepted principles of exercise prescription. Other markers of exercise capacity, such as the VT, also improve substantially following exercise training. Finally, improvement in exercise capacity is generally related to improved quality of life, particularly in patients with exercise capacity limited by various disease processes. Beyond the specific physiologic gains from training, exercise contributes to a better overall clinical outcome. Although there are few data conclusively demonstrating that exercise independently causes favorable changes in other risk factors, it should be recognized that exercise can contribute indirectly to modulation of other risk factors. Exercise represents positive health advice. Since most of our other recommendations to patients are in the nature of negative advice (e.g., don't smoke, don't eat high-fat foods), and since people are infamous for ignoring negative advice, the value of using a positive recommendation that may indirectly lead the patient to discontinue bad behaviors can hardly be overstated."
