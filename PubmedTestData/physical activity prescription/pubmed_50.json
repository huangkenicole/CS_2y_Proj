        "The benefits of physical activity have long been recognized as powerful preventive opportunities for both prevention of cardiovascular disease and aging-related morbidity. However, physical activity remains under-prescribed and under-utilized. Areas covered: In this narrative review, the authors focus on physical activity as a modifiable lifestyle factor that can modify aging processes as well as cardiovascular pathophysiology that is often exacerbated by aging. Specific recommendations are provided for physical activity over the range of typical older individuals, spanning from those who are sedentary and frail to those who are active and robust. Expert commentary: Physical activity is a critically underused preventive strategy that can prevent cardiovascular disease and mitigate some of the physiological changes that occur with aging. Identifying activities that are accessible and enjoyable, while considering issues of safety, are key to developing an individualized exercise prescription for all older adults."
