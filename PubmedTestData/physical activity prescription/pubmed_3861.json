      "AbstractText": [
        "Individuals with severe lower extremity injuries often require ankle-foot orthoses to return to normal activities. Ankle-foot orthoses alignment is a key consideration during the clinical fitting process and may be particularly important during dynamic activities such as running.",
        "To investigate how 3\u00b0 changes in sagittal plane ankle-foot orthoses alignment affect running mechanics.",
        "Controlled laboratory study.",
        "Twelve participants with unilateral lower limb injury ran overground and lower extremity running mechanics were assessed. Participants wore their passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthoses in three alignments: clinically fit neutral, 3\u00b0 plantarflexed from clinically fit neutral, and 3\u00b0 dorsiflexed from clinically fit neutral.",
        "The 3\u00b0 changes in sagittal alignment significantly influenced ankle mechanics during running. The plantarflexed alignment significantly decreased the peak ankle plantarflexor moment, peak knee extensor moment, and peak ankle and knee power absorption and generation compared to more dorsiflexed alignments. Alignment also altered footstrike angle, with dorsiflexed alignments associated with a more dorsiflexed footstrike pattern and plantarflexed alignments toward a more plantarflexed footstrike pattern. However, alignment did not influence loading rate.",
        "Small changes in ankle-foot orthoses alignment significantly altered running mechanics, including footstrike angle, and knee extensor moments. Understanding how ankle-foot orthoses design parameters affect running mechanics may aid the development of evidence-based prescription guidelines and improve function for ankle-foot orthoses users who perform high-impact activities.",
        "Understanding how ankle-foot orthoses alignment impacts biomechanics should be a consideration when fitting passive-dynamic devices for higher impact activities, such as running. Individual running styles, including footstrike patterns, may be affected by small changes in alignment."
