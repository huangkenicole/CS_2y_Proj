        "Canine obesity is the cause of several health issues, and may predispose other diseases, such as orthopaedic disorders, endocrinopathies, metabolic abnormalities and cardiorespiratory disease which can lead to a decreased quality of life and reduced lifespan. Dog are considered overweight when their body weight is \u226515% above their ideal body weight, and as obese when their body weight exceeds 30% of optimal. Prevalence of canine obesity is estimated to be around 5%-20%, and up to 30%-40% when all overweight dogs are considered. Treatment is based on weight loss programmes, focused on caloric restriction associated with exercise. However, success rate of treatment is low.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for weight loss failure of obese dogs during treatment with low-calorie diets.",
        "Records of obese dogs undergoing weight loss programmes between May 2014 and May 2017, assessed by a team specialized in veterinary nutrition, were retrospectively evaluated. Dogs were classified according to weekly weight loss rate (WWLR) (<1%, between 1% and 2%, and more than 2%) and owner compliance with a dietary prescription and physical activity recommendations.",
        "The mean WWLR was not satisfactory (<1%) in 64.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a047/73) of dogs. Regarding owner compliance with the dietary prescription, 44.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a021/47) of owners did not follow diet prescriptions and physical activity recommendations for their dogs. There was a significant association (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) between compliance of owners and satisfactory weight loss rate; however, there was no association between weight loss success, diet composition sex, reproductive status, age of the dogs and their physical activity (p\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.05).",
        "Non-compliance represents a great challenge in the treatment of canine obesity, and may be of more importance than other aspects."
