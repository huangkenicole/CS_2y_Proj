      "AbstractText": [
        "A 16-year-old female patient showed up at the orthopaedics unit complaining of intolerable pain on her left hip. While being questioned and her clinical history written down, she shared that as part of her daily exercise routine, she ran 10 miles (16\u2009km) daily at a speed of 9.5-10.5 mph (15-17\u2009km/hour). MRI was consequently ordered, confirming the presence of a stress fracture. Therefore, immediate suspension of physical activity was indicated, followed by the prescription of crutches as well as restricted weight bearing. Gradually, she recovered complete functionality and approximately a month after she had entirely healed. While on a skiing trip, again she abruptly developed an acute pain on her right hip. Another MRI was ordered; its result confirmed a new stress fracture. Her previous treatment has proved so successful, a conservative approach was once again prescribed for her, showing optimum results 6 months later."
