        "With the continuous development of social economy, students' learning is paid more and more attention, but at the same time, their physical condition also deserves attention. In view of these problems and limitations, this paper is based on intelligent sensors, which is different from the traditional physical education teaching, adopts the corresponding prescription for sports teaching, combines teaching with fun for the corresponding health intervention, and realizes the two-way dimensional analysis of compound sports prescription through comprehensive nutrition collocation, so as to improve students' physical and mental health, in order to improve students' physical fitness. The simulation results show that the intelligent sensor is effective, which can improve the systematicness and scientificity of students' participation in exercise in sports activities and improve students' learning and physical fitness."
