        "Exercise training is crucial for managing ankylosing spondylitis. We evaluated the effects of exercise with different levels of supervision on clinical outcomes in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.",
        "We performed a single-blind randomized controlled trial in a university outpatient clinic. Overall, 45 (31 men) patients with ankylosing spondylitis were randomly allocated to 3 groups. The mean (SD) for age and disease duration were 39.3 (9.3) and 8.4 (7.8) years. The primary outcome was chest expansion in cm, and the secondary outcomes were the index scores of 5 standard questionnaires. For each participant, adalimumab 40\u2009mg/0.8\u2009mL/2\u2009wk was injected and a 3-session exercise program per week for 1\u2009month was prescribed. Controls received a pamphlet on the exercise program. Another group received the pamphlet and underwent a 2-hour training session. The supervised group received the pamphlet, and the 2-hour training, and completed the program by attending each exercise session in the clinic.",
        "Within-group analysis showed significant improvement in chest expansion (P\u2009=\u20090.016) and all subjective or objective questionnaire scores (all P\u2009<\u20090.001) for the full-supervised group. Between-group analysis implied best outcomes for chest expansion (P\u2009=\u20090.046), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (P\u2009<\u20090.001), Bath Disease Activity (P\u2009=\u20090.010), and Metrology (P\u2009=\u20090.002) Indices for ankylosing spondylitis. The group with 2-hour training experienced an improvement in some indices, and the control group did not show significant changes in the outcomes.",
        "We recommend the prescription of a supervised training program instead of in-home exercises for patients with ankylosing spondylitis."
