        "Affect experienced during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) is dependent on work-intensity, but the influence of increasing (low-to-high (L-H)) or decreasing (high-to-low (H-L)) work-intensity during HIIE remains unclear in adolescents. The role of prefrontal cortex haemodynamics in mediating changes in affect during HIIE also remains unexplored in adolescents. We examined affect, enjoyment and cerebral haemodynamic responses to HIIE with increasing or decreasing work intensities in adolescents.",
        "Participants (N\u202f=\u202f16; 8 boys; age 12.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fyears) performed, on separate days, HIIE cycling consisting of 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1-min work-intervals at 100%-to-70% (HIIE<sub>H-L</sub>), 70%-to-100% (HIIE<sub>L-H</sub>) or 85% (HIIE<sub>CON</sub>) peak power separated by 75\u202fs recovery. Affect, enjoyment and cerebral haemodynamics (oxygenation (\u2206O<sub>2</sub>Hb), deoxygenation (\u2206HHb) and tissue oxygenation index (TOI)) were recorded before, during, and after all conditions.",
        "Affect and enjoyment were lower during HIIE<sub>H-L</sub> compared to HIIE<sub>L-H</sub> and HIIE<sub>CON</sub> at work-intervals 1 to 3 (all P\u202f<\u202f0.043, ES\u202f>\u202f0.83) but were greater during HIIE<sub>H-L</sub> than HIIE<sub>L-H</sub> and HIIE<sub>CON</sub> at work-interval 8 (all P\u202f<\u202f0.048, ES\u202f>\u202f0.83). \u2206O<sub>2</sub>Hb was similar across conditions (P\u202f=\u202f0.87) but TOI and \u2206HHb were significantly greater and lower, respectively during HIIE<sub>H-L</sub> compared to HIIE<sub>L-H</sub> and HIIE<sub>CON</sub> at work-interval 8 (all P\u202f<\u202f0.039, ES\u202f>\u202f0.40). Affect was correlated with TOI (all r\u202f>\u202f0.92) and \u2206HHb (all r\u202f>\u202f-0.73) across conditions.",
        "HIIE<sub>H-L</sub> offers advancement to the HIIE<sub>CON</sub> and HIIE<sub>L-H</sub> which bring significant greater affect and enjoyment towards the end HIIE work-interval, implicating the feasibility and adoption of this protocol for health promotion in youth. Also, changes in prefrontal cortex haemodynamics are associated with the affect during HIIE."
