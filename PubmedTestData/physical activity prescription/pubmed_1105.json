      "AbstractText": [
        "Children and adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) often have decreased exercise capacity and muscle mass. Exercise has numerous health benefits and can improve exercise capacity and muscle mass. As such, guidelines recommend 60\u200amin of daily physical activity in the majority of pediatric CHD patients. Despite these known benefits and guidelines, children and adolescents with CHD often do not exercise regularly. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on exercise in this population.",
        "With recent advancements in the field, clinical focus in pediatric cardiology has expanded from improving mortality to improving long-term outcomes and quality of life. As part of this paradigm shift, there is ongoing research on safety, impact, and effective delivery of exercise to this population with the overarching goal of promoting an active lifestyle.",
        "Exercise interventions are generally safe, feasible, and beneficial in children and adolescents with CHD. There is growing evidence demonstrating the benefits and utility of exercise as a prescription rather than restriction in pediatric CHD patients. Novel approaches are needed for effective delivery of exercise in this population. Further studies are warranted for assessment of long-term benefits of exercise in pediatric CHD patients."
