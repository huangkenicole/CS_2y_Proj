        "Reduced physical activity and abundant energy intake are two most common factors leading to uncontrolled body weight gain. But these factors are not under entire internal consciousness control; they are also partially genetically determined and are affected by for example food marketing practices. In addition to these two widely accepted factors, there are some other factors, whose could also contribute to the recent increase of obesity prevalence. For example, non-exercise activity thermogenesis, sleeping habits, more stable inside room temperatures (using of heating and air conditioning), high prescription of medications with weight gain as side effect, psychosocial factors, unfavourable socioeconomic status and unpleasant urban environment are the background factors which should not be omitted if obesity/BMI determination should be fully understood and kept under control. In conclusion, unhealthy life style is necessary, but not sufficient for obesity development."
