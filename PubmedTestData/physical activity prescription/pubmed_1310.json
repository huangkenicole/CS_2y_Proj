        "Self-selected intensity exercise has resulted in greater affective responses (AR) compared to prescribed exercise of similar intensity and many individuals self-select intensity at a moderate level identified by metabolic analysis. As such, self-selected intensity may be an effective alternative for exercise prescription designed to promote adherence and result in health and fitness benefits. Self-selected intensity has not been well described for many subject populations and exercise modes. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to measure affective and metabolic responses during self-selected intensity cycle exercise in college-aged men. Thirty-three men (22.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.2\u202fyr) performed a peak oxygen consumption test and a 20\u202fmin self-selected trial on a cycle ergometer on separate days. Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) was measured continuously throughout both exercise sessions. AR were measured using the Feeling Scale and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) using the OMNI Scale every 5\u202fmin during the self-selected trial. \u03c7<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to determine if a significant proportion of subjects self-selected intensity above 50% VO<sub>2</sub> reserve (VO<sub>2</sub>R), defined as a threshold for moderate-intensity exercise and potential cardiorespiratory fitness benefits by American College of Sports Medicine. Mean self-selected intensity was 57.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.1%VO<sub>2</sub>peak and 89.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.2% of ventilatory threshold. Twenty eight of 33 subjects self-selected intensity above 50% VO<sub>2</sub>R (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Self-selected intensity was associated with positive AR (1.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.4) and mean RPE of 4.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5. In college-aged men, self-selected intensity cycle exercise was performed at a moderate intensity level and elicited positive AR for most subjects. Therefore, self-selected intensity could be an effective component of an exercise prescription for this population."
