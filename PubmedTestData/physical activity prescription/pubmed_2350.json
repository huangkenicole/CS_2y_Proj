        "Understanding the most demanding scenarios of basketball match-play can optimise training prescription. We established physical demand differences in total distance covered, distance covered at high-speed running, distance covered at high-intensity accelerations and decelerations, number of high-speed running actions and number of high-intensity accelerations comparing the traditional average method with the most demanding scenarios based on 1-minute rolling averages. Physical demand parameters were analysed from 21 elite basketball players according to playing position during a friendly game via local positioning system microtechnology. The results showed that players covered a total distance of 141.3\u2005m\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001; ES\u2009=\u20097.80) and 25.4\u2005m\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001; ES\u2009=\u20094.52) at high-speed running using rolling averages, compared to 66.3 and 3.2\u2005m\u2005min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, using the traditional average approach. These data represent a very large increase of 113.1% for total distance per minute and 686.4% for high-speed running distance per minute, 252% for the number of high-intensity accelerations and 290.5% for the number of high-intensity decelerations, respectively, demonstrating the relevance of this novel approach. In conclusion, this investigation indicated that the traditional average method underestimates peak physical demands over a 1-minute period during a basketball game. Thus, the average approach should be complemented by analysing the most demanding scenarios in order to have a better understanding of physical demands during basketball competition."
