      "AbstractText": [
        "High intensity interval training is frequently implemented using the 4 \u00d7 4 protocol where four 4-min bouts are performed at heart rate (HR) between 85 and 95% HR max. This study identified the HR and power output response to the 4 \u00d7 4 protocol in 39 active men and women (age and VO<sub>2</sub> max = 26.0 \u00b1 6.1 years and 37.0 \u00b1 5.4 mL/kg/min). Initially, participants completed incremental cycling to assess VO<sub>2</sub> max, HR max, and peak power output (PPO). They subsequently completed the 4 \u00d7 4 protocol, during which HR and power output were monitored. Data showed that 12.9 \u00b1 0.4 min of 16 min were spent between 85 and 95% HR max, with time spent significantly lower in interval 1 (2.7 \u00b1 0.6 min) versus intervals 2-4 (3.4 \u00b1 0.4 min, 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 min, and 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 min, <i>d</i> = 2.4-2.7). Power output was highest in interval 1 (75% PPO) and significantly declined in intervals 2-4 (63 to 54% PPO, <i>d</i> = 0.7-1.0). To enhance time spent between 85 and 95% HR max for persons with higher fitness, we recommend immediate allocation of supramaximal intensities in interval one."
