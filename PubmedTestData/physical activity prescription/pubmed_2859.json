        "Regular exercise improves muscle and cardiovascular function, which is why exercise is used as an adjuvant treatment in myopathies. In this review, we provide an update on recent exercise studies (from 2016) performed in humans with inherited myopathy.",
        "Several studies provide new and interesting insight in the field of exercise in myopathies. A retrospective cohort study suggests that exercise may actually increase rate of disease progression in dysferlinopathy, and high intensity exercise, which is normally discouraged in muscle disorders because of the risk of muscle damage, is demonstrated to be an efficient time saving mode of exercise to train patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Exoskeletons and antigravity trainers are examples of new devices, which provide an opportunity for very weak patients to train. Finally, several studies, including two randomized controlled trials, support the beneficial role of exercise as treatment of myopathy.",
        "The reviewed studies extend previous knowledge about exercise, indicating that exercise is generally safe and well tolerated, and improves functional outcomes in patients with inherited muscle disease. However, recent studies also highlight the fact that the effect of exercise differs with mode of exercise and exercise prescriptions should be disease specific."
