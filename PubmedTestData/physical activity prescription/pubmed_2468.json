      "AbstractText": [
        "We aimed to investigate the effect of different intensities of aerobic exercise (VO<sub>2</sub>max: 50% vs. 80%) on body weight, body fat percentage, lipid profiles, and adipokines in obese middle-aged women after 8 weeks of combined aerobic and resistance exercise. The participants included 16 women aged >40 years with a body fat percentage of \u226530%; they were randomly assigned to the resistance and either moderate (RME, 50% VO<sub>2</sub>max, 200 kcal [<i>n</i> = 8]) or vigorous aerobic exercise groups (RVE, 80% VO<sub>2</sub>max, 200 kcal [<i>n</i> = 8]), respectively. After 8 weeks of exercise, we observed that body weight and body fat percentage decreased significantly in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The total cholesterol (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and LDL (<i>p</i> < 0.05) levels decreased significantly in the RME group, while triglyceride levels decreased significantly in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The HDL levels tended to increase only slightly in both groups. The adiponectin levels decreased significantly in the RVE group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the leptin levels decreased significantly in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). To prevent and treat obesity in middle-aged women, combined exercise (aerobic and resistance) is deemed effective; additionally, aerobic exercise of moderate intensity during combined exercise could be more effective than that of vigorous intensity."
