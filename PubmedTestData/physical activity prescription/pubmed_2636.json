        "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a life-saving technology that can cure otherwise incurable diseases, but imposes significant physiologic stress upon recipients. This stress leads to short-term toxicity and mid- to long-term physical function impairment in some recipients. Exercise interventions have demonstrated preliminary efficacy in preserving physical function in HCT recipients, but the role of these interventions prior to HCT (prehabilitative) is less known. We tested a 5- to 12-week, prehabilitative higher intensity home-based aerobic exercise intervention in a randomized study of alloHCT candidates. Of 113 patients screened, 34 were randomized to control or intervention groups, 16 underwent pre- and post-intervention peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) testing, and 12 underwent pre- and post-intervention 6-min walk distance (6MWD) testing. No significant differences in VO<sub>2peak</sub> or 6MWD were seen pre- to post-intervention between intervention and control groups, but final numbers of evaluable participants in each group were too small to draw inferences regarding the efficacy of the intervention. We conclude that the design of our prehabilitative intervention was not feasible in this pilot randomized study, and make recommendations regarding the design of future exercise intervention studies in alloHCT."
