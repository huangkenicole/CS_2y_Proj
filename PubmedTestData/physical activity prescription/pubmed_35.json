        "Physical activity is a useful means to improve symptoms and memory performance to some extent in individuals with stress-induced exhaustion disorder. Individuals in this group commonly do not need to reach the recommended levels of physical activity. Developing methods to support physical activity as a lasting behaviour is important.",
        "The aim of the study was to explore the processes involved when using physical activity prescription as part of rehabilitation in a group context for individuals with stress-induced exhaustion disorder.",
        "A total of 27 individuals with stress-induced exhaustion disorder participated in six focus groups. The informants underwent a multimodal intervention including prescription of physical activity. The physical activity prescription had a cognitive behaviour approach and included information about physical activity, home assignments and goal setting. The data was analysed with grounded theory method using constant comparison.",
        "The analysis of the data was developed into the core category 'trying to integrate physical activity into daily life in a sustainable way', and three categories: 'acceptance of being good enough', 'learning physical activity by doing' and 'advocation for physical activity in rehabilitation'. The informants identified that during the physical activity prescription sessions they learned what physical activity was, what was 'good enough' in terms of dose and intensity of physical activity, and how to listen to the body's signals. These insights, in combination with performing physical activity during home assignments and reflecting with peers, helped them incorporate physical activity in a new and sustainable way. A need for more customised physical activity with the ability to adjust to individual circumstances was requested.",
        "Prescription of physical activity in a group context may be a useful method of managing and adjusting physical activity in a sustainable way for individuals with stress-induced exhaustion disorder. However, identifying people who need more tailored support is important."
