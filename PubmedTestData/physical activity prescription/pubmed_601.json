        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardiorespiratory response and energy expenditure during the practice of Tai Chi Easy (TCE). TCE has been proposed as a low-intensity alternative to traditional physical activity.",
        "Oxygen cost data were collected from 10 healthy adult women (mean age of 47.9 \u00b1 12.8 years) at rest and during a 30-min session of TCE using an automated metabolic cart and heart rate (HR) telemetry. The Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale was utilized to measure subjective intensity of the TCE movements.",
        "The mean oxygen consumption (VO(2)) for the movements ranged from 4.3 ml kg(-1)min(-1) to 5.5 ml kg(-1)min(-1) with an overall mean of 5.0 ml kg(-1)min(-1). The mean HR for all activity was 67.0 beats per minute and the mean energy expenditure (EE) was 1.6 Kcal min(-1).",
        "Cardiorespiratory and EE responses to TCE indicate that this a low intensity exercise appropriate for individuals requiring activity prescriptions of approximately 2 metabolic equivalents (METs)."
