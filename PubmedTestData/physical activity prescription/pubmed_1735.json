        "The purpose of this study was to compare physiological responses and perceived exertion among well-trained cyclists (n = 63) performing 3 different high-intensity interval-training (HIIT) prescriptions differing in work-bout duration and accumulated duration but all prescribed with maximal session effort. Subjects (male, mean \u00b1 SD 38 \u00b1 8 y, VO<sub>2peak</sub> 62 \u00b1 6 mL \u00b7 kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7 min<sup>-1</sup>) completed up to 24 HIIT sessions over 12 wk as part of a training-intervention study. Sessions were prescribed as 4 \u00d7 16, 4 \u00d7 8, or 4 \u00d7 4 min with 2-min recovery periods (8 sessions of each prescription, balanced over time). Power output, HR, and RPE were collected during and after each work bout. Session RPE was reported after each session. Blood lactate samples were collected throughout the 12 wk. Physiological and perceptual responses during >1400 training sessions were analyzed. HIIT sessions were performed at 95% \u00b1 5%, 106% \u00b1 5%, and 117% \u00b1 6% of 40-min time-trial power during 4 \u00d7 16-, 4 \u00d7 8-, and 4 \u00d7 4-min sessions, respectively, with peak HR in each work bout averaging 89% \u00b1 2%, 91% \u00b1 2%, and 94% \u00b1 2% HR<sub>peak</sub>. Blood lactate concentrations were 4.7 \u00b1 1.6, 9.2 \u00b1 2.4, and 12.7 \u00b1 2.7 mmol/L. Despite the common prescription of maximal session effort, RPE and sRPE increased with decreasing accumulated work duration (AWD), tracking relative HR. Only 8% of 4 \u00d7 16-min sessions reached RPE 19-20, vs 61% of 4 \u00d7 4-min sessions. The authors conclude that within the HIIT duration range, performing at \"maximal session effort\" over a reduced AWD is associated with higher perceived exertion both acutely and postexercise. This may have important implications for HIIT prescription choices."
