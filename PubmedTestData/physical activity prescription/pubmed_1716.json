      "AbstractText": [
        "An acute bout of sprint interval training (SIT) performed with psychological need-support incorporating autonomy, competence, and relatedness has been shown to attenuate energy intake at the post-exercise meal, but the long-term effects are not known. The aim of this trial was to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of SIT combined with need-support on post-exercise food consumption. Thirty-six physically inactive participants with overweight and obesity (BMI: 29.6 \u00b1 3.8 kg\u00b7m\u22122; V\u02d9O2peak 20.8 \u00b1 4.1 mL\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121) completed three sessions per week of SIT (alternating cycling for 15 s at 170% V\u02d9O2peak and 60 s at 32% V\u02d9O2peak) with need-support or traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) without need-support (continuous cycling at 60% V\u02d9O2peak). Assessments of appetite, appetite-related hormones, and ad libitum energy intake in response to acute exercise were conducted pre- and post-intervention. Fasting appetite and blood concentrations of active ghrelin, leptin, and insulin did not significantly differ between groups or following the training. Post-exercise energy intake from snacks decreased significantly from pre- (807 \u00b1 550 kJ) to post- SIT (422 \u00b1 468 kJ; p < 0.05) but remained unaltered following MICT. SIT with psychological need-support appears well-tolerated in a physically inactive population with overweight and offers an alternative to traditional exercise prescription where dietary intake is of concern."
