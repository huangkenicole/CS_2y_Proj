        "Castagna, C, Bizzini, M, Ara\u00fajo P\u00f3voas, SC, Schenk, K, B\u00fcsser, G, and D'Ottavio, S. Aerobic fitness in top-class soccer referees. J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3098-3104, 2019-The aim of this study was to examine the aerobic fitness status of top-class male soccer officials using a cross-sectional design and known population group constructs. Fifty-two field referees (FRs, age 38.4 \u00b1 3.3 years; height 181 \u00b1 5.6 cm; body mass 76.8 \u00b1 6.8 kg; body mass index [BMI] 23.4 \u00b1 1.7 kg\u00b7m; body fat 20.4 \u00b1 3.6%; and international refereeing experience 5 \u00b1 3.5 years) and 104 assistant referees (ARs, age 37.8 \u00b1 4.1 years; height 176.9 \u00b1 7.5 cm; body mass 72.1 \u00b1 7.4 kg; BMI 23 \u00b1 1.6 kg\u00b7m; body fat 19.2 \u00b1 3.6%; and international refereeing experience 7 \u00b1 3.8 years) from 53 National Football Associations worldwide, and candidates of the preliminary open-list developed by the FIFA Refereeing Department for the 2014 World Cup Final Tournament, were tested for aerobic fitness in laboratory conditions with a progressive speed treadmill test to exhaustion. Large (+8.54%, d = 0.8) and small (+3.1%, d = 0.3) differences in absolute (L\u00b7min) and relative (ml\u00b7kg\u00b7min) VO2max were found between FR and AR, respectively. Trivial differences (d = 0.07) were shown in running economy (RE) (6 minutes at 8 km\u00b7h) between AR and FR. Using the scaling notation (b = 0.64), medium and significant differences were found between match officials for VO2max and RE (FR > AR; d = 0.6 and 0.67, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curve statistics, cutoff values of 3.93 L\u00b7min and 50.6 ml\u00b7kg\u00b7min were detected in absolute and relative VO2max for the FR and the AR (FR > AR), respectively. The FR showed superior aerobic fitness compared with AR. Training prescription should consider intensities at anaerobic threshold speed (14 km\u00b7h, 91% heart rate max) when aerobic fitness development is the aim in elite officials."
