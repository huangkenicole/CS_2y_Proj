      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aims to determine whether the prescription of a detailed lifestyle programme in overweight/obese pregnant women influences the occurrence of gestational diabetes (GDM), and if this kind of prescription increases the adherence to a healthier lifestyle in comparison to standard care. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial, with open allocation, enrolling women at 9-12\u2009weeks of pregnancy with a BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> . The women assigned to the Intervention group (I\u2009=\u200996) received a hypocaloric, low-glycaemic, low-saturated fat diet and physical activity recommendations. Those assigned to the Standard Care group (SC\u2009=\u200995) received lifestyle advices regarding healthy nutrition and exercise. Follow-up was planned at the 16<sup>th</sup> , 20<sup>th</sup> , 28<sup>th</sup> and 36<sup>th</sup> weeks. A total of 131 women completed the study (I\u2009=\u200969, SC\u2009=\u200962). The diet adherence was higher in the I (57.9%) than in the SC (38.7%) group. GDM occurred less frequently in the I (18.8%) than in the SC (37.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.019) group. The adherent women from either groups showed a lower GDM rate (12.5% vs. 41.8%, P <\u20090.001). After correcting for confounders, the GDM rate was explained by allocation into the I group (P\u2009=\u20090.034) and a lower BMI category (P\u2009=\u20090.039). The rates of hypertension, preterm birth, induction of labour, large for gestational age babies and birthweight\u2009>\u20094000\u2009g were significantly lower in I group. The incidence of small for gestational age babies was not different. These findings demonstrate that the adherence to a personalized, hypocaloric, low-glycaemic, low-saturated fat diet started early in pregnancy prevents GDM occurrence, in women with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> ."
