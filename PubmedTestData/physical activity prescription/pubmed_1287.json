        "Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) as a training-intensity prescription has been extensively used by athletes and coaches. However, individual variability in the physiological response to exercise prescribed using RPE has not been investigated.",
        "Twenty well-trained competitive cyclists (male = 18, female = 2, maximum oxygen consumption = 55.07 [11.06]\u00a0mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) completed 3 exercise trials each consisting of 9 randomized self-paced exercise bouts of either 1, 4, or 8\u00a0minutes at RPEs of 9, 13, and 17. Within-athlete variability (WAV) and between-athletes variability (BAV) in power and physiological responses were calculated using the coefficient of variation. Total variability was calculated as the\u00a0ratio of WAV to BAV.",
        "Increased RPEs were associated with higher power, heart rate, work, volume of expired oxygen (VO2), volume of expired carbon dioxide\u00a0(VCO2), minute ventilation\u00a0(VE), deoxyhemoglobin (\u0394HHb) (P < .001), and lower tissue saturation index (\u0394TSI%) and \u0394O2Hb (oxyhaemoglobin; P < .001). At an RPE of 9, shorter durations resulted in lower VO2 (P < .05) and decreased \u0394TSI%, and the \u0394HHb increased as the duration increased (P < .05). At an RPE of 13, shorter durations resulted in lower VO2, VE, and percentage of maximum oxygen consumption (P < .001), as well as higher power, heart rate, \u0394HHb (P < .001), and \u0394TSI% (P < .05). At an RPE of 17, power (P < .001) and \u0394TSI% (P < .05) increased as duration decreased. As intensity and duration increased, WAV and BAV in power, work, heart rate, VO2, VCO2, and VE decreased, and WAV and BAV in near-infrared spectroscopy increased.",
