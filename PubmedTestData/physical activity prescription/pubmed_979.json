        "Exercise velocity and relative velocity loss thresholds (VLTs) are commonly used in velocity-based resistance training. This study aims to quantify the between-day reliability of 10%, 20%, and 30% VLTs on kinetic and kinematic outputs, changes in external load, and repetition characteristics in well-trained athletes. Using a repeated, counter-balanced crossover design, twelve semi-professional athletes completed five sets of the back squat with an external load corresponding to a mean concentric velocity of ~0.70 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> and a VLT applied. The testing sessions were repeated after four weeks of unstructured training to assess the long-term reliability of each VLT. A coefficient of variation (CV) <10% was used to classify outputs as reliable. Kinetic and kinematic outputs and external load were largely reliable, with only peak power during sets 2-5 within the 10% VLT condition demonstrating a CV >10% (CV: 11.14-14.92%). Alternatively, the repetitions completed within each set showed large variation (CV: 18.92-67.49%). These findings demonstrate that by utilizing VLTs, kinetic and kinematic outputs can be prescribed and replicated across training mesocycles. Thus, for practitioners wishing to reliably control the kinetic and kinematic stimulus that is being applied to their athletes, it is advised that a velocity-based approach is used."
