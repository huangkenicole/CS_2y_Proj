        "Physical activity improves physical functioning, cancer-related symptoms, and quality of life in cancer survivors, and is beneficial across all phases of survivorship. Observational studies suggest that high levels of physical activity may also improve cancer outcomes such as survival, but randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions in oncology patients with survival outcomes as a primary endpoint are needed and ongoing. This review focuses on the role of physical activity in breast and gynecologic cancer survivorship, based on the available evidence. It discusses specific guidelines for exercise prescription, highlights the role of the clinician in promoting physical activity, and provides useful resources for cancer survivors."
