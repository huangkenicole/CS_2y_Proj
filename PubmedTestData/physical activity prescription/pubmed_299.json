        "Healthy lifestyle is capable of positively modifying the survival of breast cancer (BC) patients. We aimed to evaluate how physician's lifestyle influences on the prescription of healthy habits to BC patients.",
        "An online questionnaire to evaluate physician lifestyle and prescription of healthy habits to BC patients was developed and circulated by e-mail to physicians dedicated to treat BC patients. A multivariate Poisson regression analysis assessed which factors of physician lifestyle could influence on prescription of healthy habits.",
        "A total of 267 physicians answered the questionnaire from October to November 2018. In terms of physician lifestyle, 228 (85.4%) had healthy eating habits and 236 (88.4%) practiced physical activity. Overall, 84.3% of the physicians advised their BC patients on the importance of lifestyle modification. Physicians who did not exercise regularly have a higher probability of not advising for health lifestyle (RR 2.48; p\u2009=\u20090.0265) as opposite to physicians\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0years-old (RR 0.37; p\u2009=\u20090.0118). Obesity treatment and management was performed by 45.3% of physicians. Being a breast surgeon (RR 1.29; p\u2009=\u20090.0025) or radiation oncologists (RR 1.82; p\u2009=\u20090.0025) were associated with not performing obesity treatment and management. About 53.4% of physicians referred overweight or obese patients to a dietitian and/or endocrinologist. Male gender (RR 1.35; p\u2009=\u20090.0296), breast surgeons (RR 1.99; p\u2009=\u20090.0001), and clinical practice in public health system (RR 1.53; p\u2009=\u20090.0012) were associated with not referring as opposed to physicians\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0years-old (RR 0.46; p\u2009=\u20090.0005).",
        "Our survey showed some influence of physician's lifestyle on the prescription of healthy habits to BC patients. Physicians who practice physical activity regularly had a higher probability of advising lifestyle modification and about half of physicians did some type of overweight and obese management."
