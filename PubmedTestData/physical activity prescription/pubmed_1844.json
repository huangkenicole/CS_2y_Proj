        "Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are used to record training and match play of intermittent team sport athletes. Paired with estimates of internal responses or adaptations to exercise, practitioners gain insight into players' dose-response relationship which facilitates the prescription of the training stimuli to optimize performance, prevent injuries, and to guide rehabilitation processes. A systematic review on the relationship between external, wearable-based, and internal parameters in team sport athletes, compliant with the PRISMA guidelines, was conducted. The literature research was performed from earliest record to 1 September 2020 using the databases PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and SportDISCUS. A total of 66 full-text articles were reviewed encompassing 1541 athletes. About 109 different relationships between variables have been reviewed. The most investigated relationship across sports was found between (session) rating of perceived exertion ((session-)RPE) and PlayerLoad\u2122 (PL) with, predominantly, moderate to strong associations (r = 0.49-0.84). Relationships between internal parameters and highly dynamic, anaerobic movements were heterogenous. Relationships between average heart rate (HR), Edward's and Banister's training impulse (TRIMP) seem to be reflected in parameters of overall activity such as PL and TD for running-intensive team sports. PL may further be suitable to estimate the overall subjective perception. To identify high fine-structured loading-relative to a certain type of sport-more specific measures and devices are needed. Individualization of parameters could be helpful to enhance practicality."
