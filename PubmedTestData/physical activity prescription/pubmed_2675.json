        "Blood pressure regulation following spinal cord injury (SCI) is often compromised due to impaired vascular sympathetic control, leading to increased reliance on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity to maintain pressure. Whole-body exercise improves cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity in uninjured individuals, though has not been explored in those with SCI. Our objective was to determine changes in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity following 6 months of high-intensity, whole-body exercise in individuals with SCI compared to lower-intensity, arms only exercise, or waitlist. This randomized controlled trial recruited individuals with SCI aged 18-40 years old. Sixty-one individuals were randomized, with 38 completing at least one cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity assessment. Whole-body exercise was performed with hybrid functional electrical stimulation rowing prescribed as two to three times per week, for 30-60 minutes with a target heart rate of >75% of maximum. The arms only exercise group performed upper body rowing exercise with the same prescription as whole-body exercise. Waitlist controls were not enrolled in any explicit training regimen. After 6 months, those in arms only exercise or waitlist crossed over to whole-body exercise. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity was assessed via the neck suction technique at baseline and at three-month intervals thereafter. Intention to treat analysis with a structured equation model demonstrated no significant effect of waitlist control or arms only exercise on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity. Whole-body exercise significantly improved cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity at 6 months for those initially randomized (p = 0.03), as well as those who crossed over from arms only exercise or waitlist control (p = 0.03 for each). However, amount of exercise performed and aerobic gains (VO2max) each poorly correlated with increases in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (R2<0.15). In post-hoc analyses, individuals with paraplegia made significantly greater gains in baroreflex sensitivity compared to those with tetraplegia (p = 0.02), though gains within this group were again poorly correlated to gains in aerobic capacity. Clinicaltrials.gov number NCT02139436."
