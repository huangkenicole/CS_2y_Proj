        "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between knee extension strength and gait performance with walking aids and the threshold level of strength to predict gait performance with walking aids in patients with dementia using ordinal logistic modeling.This cross-sectional, observational correlation study was conducted in 56 hospital inpatients with dementia. Knee extensor strength was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Gait performance was assessed by determining the walking aid that enables the subject to walk 10 m independently as well as without a walking aid.Ordinal logistic modeling showed that the strength of the knee extensor muscles was a significant gait predictor with walking aids (P\u200a=\u200a.028). Knee extension strength of 0.17, 0.43, and 0.57\u200aN\u200am/kg could reach 80% independence probability for gait with walker, with cane, and without walking aid, respectively.Knee extension strength was significantly related to gait performance with walking aid in people with dementia. Moreover, there are threshold levels of strength that could predict gait with particular walking aid in people with dementia. With regard to resistance training and prescription of walking aids, the probability of independence evaluated from ordinal logistic modeling contributes to efficient rehabilitation intervention."
