      "AbstractText": [
        "The physical activity (PA) prescription workshop for physicians, through the global health initiative \"Exercise is Medicine\" (EIM), has trained more than 4000 health care professionals (HCPs) in Latin America. It has shown to be effective in increasing PA prescription knowledge and awareness among HCPs. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the curricular and pedagogical approach used by EIM Colombia at the PA prescription workshops implemented between 2014 and 2015.",
        "A mixed methods study, with a sequential explanatory design was implemented among a convenience sample of HCPs attending twenty-six PA prescription workshops. HCPs health status, PA personal habits, and medical practices were collected using a questionnaire at baseline among 795 participants (pre-test measurement), and subsequently quantitatively analyzed. A workshop satisfaction survey was administered after the completion of the workshop among 602 HCPs. The curricular and pedagogical approach of the workshop, the designers' and students' contextual factors, and perceptions about the workshop were measured using qualitative methods (analysis of the procedures manual, two workshop observations, three semi-structured interviews, and one focus group including 8 HCPs).",
        "The workshop is student-centered and guided by an expert with an academic and clinical background. Learning was achieved with theoretical and practical components using authentic performance and collaborative learning. An active teaching and learning approach was used with strategies such as interactive lectures, hands-on elements, and role-playing (patient-counselor). The workshop emphasized an individual approach when prescribing PA integrating in clinical practice not only health benefits but also patient\u00b4s beliefs, motivations, needs, and barriers.",
        "Evidence-based practices and authentic performance were the most salient pedagogical elements used by EIM Colombia at the PA prescription workshop. A knowledge assessment that includes the practical aspect is suggested for future workshops. The curricular and pedagogical approach of the PA prescription workshop implemented in Colombia is well received by the medical community and a useful continuing medical education intervention with a potential contribution to current, and future health promotion needs."
