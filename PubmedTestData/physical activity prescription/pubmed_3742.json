        "This study aimed to assess the within- and between-session reliability of the KiSprint system for determining force-velocity-power (FVP) profiling during sprint running. Thirty (23 males, 7 females; 18.7 \u00b1 2.6 years;) young high-level sprinters performed maximal effort sprints in two sessions separated by one week. Split times (5, 10, 20 and 30 m), which were recorded with a laser distance meter (a component of the KiSprint system), were used to determine the horizontal FVP profile using the Samozino's field-based method. This method assesses the FVP relationships through estimates of the step-averaged ground reaction forces in sagittal plane during sprint acceleration using only anthropometric and spatiotemporal (split times) data. We also calculated the maximal theoretical power, force and velocity capabilities and the slope of the FV relationship, the maximal ratio of horizontal-to-resultant force (RF), and the decrease in the RF (D<sub>RF</sub>). Overall, the results showed moderate or good to excellent within- and between-session reliability for all variables (ICC > 0.75; CV < 10 %), with the exception of FV slope and D<sub>RF</sub> that showed low relative reliability (ICC = 0.47-0.48 within session, 0.31-0.33 between-session) and unacceptable between-session absolute reliability values (CV = 10.9-11.1 %). Future studies are needed to optimize the protocol in order to maximize the reliability of the FVP variables, especially when practitioners are interested in the FV slope and D<sub>RF</sub>. In summary, our results question the utility of the sprint-based FVP profiling for individualized training prescription, since the reliability of the FV slope and D RF variables is highly questionable."
