        "Resistance exercise increases muscular strength and endurance, which prevents injuries associated with musculoskeletal disorders, favorably alters muscle fiber type distribution, and up-regulates the genetic expression of certain enzymes seen in dysfunctional skeletal muscles. Although the benefits of resistance exercise are well documented in the literature, this form of exercise is not routinely recommended for patients with heart failure for fear of symptom exacerbation, and because of poor understanding of how best to prescribe this type of exercise. Because muscle atrophy and deconditioning states are common findings in patients with heart failure, these patients stand to benefit substantially from resistance training because this type of physical activity results in functional adaptations in the neuromuscular system. This article addresses changes in skeletal muscle pathophysiology that occur in patients with heart failure and the potential role resistance training may play in reversing this sequela, and recommends a weight lifting exercise prescription for these patients."
