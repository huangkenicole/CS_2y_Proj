        "Sex-related differences in changes in functional fitness over time were longitudinally assessed in older adults participating in a group-based multimodal exercise program. From a database, functional fitness scores were obtained for 89 older adults (71.6 \u00b1 6.5\u00a0years old) who had completed two assessments, 5-8\u00a0years apart. Lower body strength, upper body strength, aerobic endurance, flexibility, and change of direction performances were compared over time and with normative values. Females (p = .02), but not males, had an improvement in upper body strength over time. Females were also more flexible than males at both assessments (p \u2264 .02). Of those who had five consecutive assessments, females were more flexible than males (p \u2264 .05) and had a faster change of direction ability (p < .001). When compared with normative values, our results indicate that typical time-related functional fitness loss can be attenuated with group exercise. Our results further support the need to tailor exercise prescription according to the individual."
