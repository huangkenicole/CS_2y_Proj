        "Reports suggest that the blood pressure (BP) response to an acute bout of exercise is associated with the BP response to aerobic training in participants with elevated BP. These associations have not been tested among patients with resistant hypertension. This study aimed to determine whether the BP response to acute exercise predicts the 24-h ambulatory BP response to a 12-week exercise training program in patients with resistant hypertension (n\u2009=\u200926, aged 59.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2 years, 24-h ambulatory BP 127.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2/75.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u2009mm Hg) who completed the exercise arm of the EnRicH trial. Ambulatory BP measurements were obtained before and after the exercise program to assess the chronic BP response. To assess acute BP changes, resting BP was measured before and 10\u2009min after three exercise sessions in the third week of training and averaged. The resting systolic (9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and diastolic BP (1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2, p\u2009=\u20090.005) were reduced after acute exercise. The 24-h systolic (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2, p\u2009=\u20090.015) and diastolic BP (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1, p\u2009=\u20090.001) were decreased after exercise training. The reductions in systolic BP after acute exercise were associated with the reductions in 24-h systolic BP after exercise training (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.538, adjusted r<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.260, P\u2009=\u20090.005). The reductions in diastolic BP after acute exercise (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.453, adjusted r<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.187) and baseline 24-h diastolic BP (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-0.459, adjusted r<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090. 199) accounted for 38.6% (p\u2009=\u20090.008) of the 24-h diastolic BP response to exercise training. In conclusion, the magnitude of the BP response to acute exercise appears to predict the ambulatory BP response to exercise training among patients with resistant hypertension."
