        "Children with severe cerebral palsy (CP) (GMFCS IV/V) can find it difficult to access equipment that allows them to exercise effectively, potentially impacting their quality of life. Physiotherapists working within special schools are well placed to facilitate increased physical activity as part of the school day. This study explored whether the Innowalk Pro, a robotic rehabilitation trainer, could influence quality of life (measured by the CPCHILD questionnaire), in children with CP, alongside, joint range of movement, spasticity and functional goals of the lower limbs, measured by goniometry, modified Tardieu scale and goal attainment scoring, GAS, respectively.",
        "A prospective single-arm, pre-post trial was undertaken. The Innowalk Pro was used four times a week for 30\u2009min alongside usual physiotherapy care in a school setting over a 6-week period. Outcomes were evaluated immediately pre/post intervention and at 6\u2009weeks and 3\u2009months post intervention. Analysis also explored differences between primary and secondary age participants.",
        "Twenty-seven participants aged 5-18\u2009years with a diagnosis of CP GMFCS IV/V (10 female, 17 male, mean age 12\u2009years) were included from a convenience sample in a special school. Quality of life improved in 36% of participants, the majority of these being secondary aged. Knee extension reduced significantly 3\u2009months post intervention. There were no meaningful changes in spasticity. GAS goals improved in 88% of participants after using the Innowalk Pro. GAS goals tended to decline after a break from using the equipment, with 21% declining by two or more units at 3\u2009months post intervention.",
        "A 6-week course of the Innowalk Pro can improve quality of life and functional goals for children with CP aged 5-18\u2009years. After a break of 6-12\u2009weeks, functional goals tend to return to baseline. Further research is needed to explore different prescriptions of the Innowalk Pro, to see if increasing the time used/increasing the frequency or number of weeks it is used for can provide longer lasting benefits."
