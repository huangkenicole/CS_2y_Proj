        "Stretching intensity is an important variable that can be manipulated with flexibility training. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding this variable and its prescription in stretching programs.",
        "To investigate the effects of 12 weeks of knee flexor static stretching at different intensities on joint and muscle mechanical properties.",
        "A randomized clinical trial.",
        "Laboratory.",
        "A total of 14 untrained men were allocated into the low- or high-intensity group.",
        "Assessments were performed before, at 6 week, and after intervention (12 wk) for biceps femoris long head architecture (resting fascicle length and angle), knee maximal range of motion (ROM) at the beginning and maximal discomfort angle, knee maximal tolerated passive torque, joint passive stiffness, viscoelastic stress relaxation, knee passive torque at a given angle, and affective responses to training.",
        "No significant differences were observed between groups for any variable. ROM at the beginning and maximal discomfort angle increased at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. ROM significantly increased with the initial angle of discomfort (P < .001, effect size = 1.38) over the pretest measures by 13.4% and 14.6% at the 6- and 12-week assessments, respectively, and significantly improved with the maximal discomfort angle (P < .001, effect size = 1.25) by 15.6% and 18.8% from the pretest to the 6- and 12-week assessments, respectively. No significant effects were seen for muscle architecture and affective responses. Initial viscoelastic relaxation for the low-intensity group was lower than ending viscoelastic relaxation.",
        "These results suggest that stretching with either low or high discomfort intensities are effective in increasing joint maximal ROM, and that does not impact on ROM, stiffness, fascicle angle and length, or affective response differences."
