        "Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) is a rare disease associated with different level of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency resulting with a variety of clinical manifestations which could limit exercise capacity. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is valuable in differential diagnosis of exercise intolerance and exercise prescription.",
        "An 18-year-old male adolescent was diagnosed with PSIS at 4\u00a0years old, had undergone growth hormone supplement until puberty, and was referred to rehabilitation department due to exercise intolerance. We arranged pulmonary function test (PFT) and CPET to clarify the cause of limited capacity. The test result provided evidence of moderate functional impairment (54% of predicted maximal oxygen uptake) mainly affected by physical unfitness without significant cardiovascular or pulmonary limitations.",
        "CPET serves as a valuable tool for diagnostic purpose. Aerobic and resistance exercise training for the patient should be conducted promptly for better prognosis but under safe circumstances, with criteria which could be provided by CPET results."
