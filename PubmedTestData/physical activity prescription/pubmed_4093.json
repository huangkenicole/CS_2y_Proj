        "Retrospective cohort study.",
        "Persons with a lower limb amputation can regain mobility using a prosthetic device. For fast and adequate prescription of prosthetic components, it is necessary to predict the mobility outcome early in rehabilitation. Currently, prosthetic prescription is primarily based on empirical knowledge of rehabilitation professionals.",
        "In this study, we explored motor ability tests, to be completed without a prosthetic device, which have predictive value for mobility outcome at the end of rehabilitation.",
        "For this study, data of 82 patients with a lower limb amputation were included. The Single-limb standing balance test (Balance test), the Lower-Extremity Motor Coordination Test and the Amputee Mobility Predictor Assessment Tool (AMPnoPRO) were used as measures for motor ability. Mobility outcome was measured using the Timed Up and Go Test, the Two-Minute Walking Test and K levels were used.",
        "The explained variance of the Balance test, the Lower-Extremity Motor Coordination Test and the AMPnoPRO was, respectively, 0.603, 0.534 and 0.649 on the Two-Minute Walking Test (linear regression); 0.597, 0.431 and 0.624 on the Timed Up and Go Test (linear regression); and 0.432, 0.420 and 0.526 on the K levels (logistic regression).",
        "The AMPnoPRO predicted mobility outcome statistically (largest amount of explained variance). Clinical relevance This study explored the possibility of statistically predicting mobility outcome in lower limb amputees at the end of rehabilitation, using motor ability tests conducted in early rehabilitation. This study suggests the use of the AMPnoPRO to predict mobility outcome in lower limb amputees."
