        "A physical activity algorithm for adults was created with the aim of reducing patients' barriers for physical activity by providing healthcare professionals with a standardized process to guide clinical discussions on physical activity to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, specifically cancer.",
        "The physical activity algorithm was designed as an applicable process that could be adopted in many professional settings with the mission to provide relevant, safe, and appropriate physical activity interventions.",
        "A multidisciplinary team designed a physical activity algorithm that incorporated guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.",
        "The algorithm is a road map for nurses or physicians to provide evidence-based recommendations, knowledge of physical activity importance, and personalized exercise prescriptions for chronic disease risk reduction and to improve quality of life in a target population."
