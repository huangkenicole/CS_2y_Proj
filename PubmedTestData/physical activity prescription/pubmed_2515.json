        "The mortality of coronary heart disease continues to rise. Cardiac rehabilitation intervenes the risk factors of cardiovascular disease, improves cardiopulmonary function, maintains healthy psychology, improves the quality of life of patients, and reduces cardiovascular mortality.",
        "To explore the effect of acupuncture combined with aerobic exercise on cardiopulmonary exercise ability, blood lipid, fatty acid oxidation, and psychology in patients with coronary heart disease.",
        "Sixty patients with coronary heart disease from February 2018 to October 2020 were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and experimental group. The control group was given an exercise prescription, and the experimental group was given acupuncture combined with an exercise prescription. Before and after the intervention, the cardiopulmonary exercise test, blood lipid, carnitine acyltransferase (CACT), the Self-Rating Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) of the two groups were compared.",
        "The PHQ-9 score was better in the experimental group than in the control group. In both groups, after the intervention, the peak oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold were increased, and blood lipid and PHQ-9 scores were decreased. In the experimental group, the carbon dioxide metabolic equivalent was decreased, CACT was increased, and SSS and GAD-7 scores were decreased, with statistical difference (<i>P</i> < 0.05).",
        "Acupuncture combined with aerobic exercise can improve the cardiopulmonary exercise ability, increase fatty acid oxidation, decrease blood lipid, and ameliorate anxiety and depression symptoms of patients with coronary heart disease as cardiac rehabilitation."
