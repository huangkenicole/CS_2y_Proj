        "Older persons with obesity aged 65+ residing in rural areas have reduced access to weight management programs due to geographic isolation. The ability to integrate technology into health promotion interventions shows a potential to reach this underserved population.",
        "A 12-week pilot in 28 older rural adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u2265 30 kg/m2) was conducted at a community aging center. The intervention consisted of individualized, weekly dietitian visits focusing on behavior therapy and caloric restriction with twice weekly physical therapist-led group strengthening training classes in a community-based aging center. All participants were provided a Fitbit Flex 2. An aerobic activity prescription outside the strength training classes was provided.",
        "Mean age was 72.9 \u00b1 5.3 years (82% female). Baseline BMI was 37.1 kg/m2, and waist circumference was 120.0 \u00b1 33.0 cm. Mean weight loss (pre/post) was 4.6 \u00b1 3.2 kg (4.9 \u00b1 3.4%; p < .001). Of the 40 eligible participants, 33 (75%) enrolled, and the completion rate was high (84.8%). Objective measures of physical function improved at follow-up: 6-minute walk test improved: 35.7 \u00b1 41.2 m (p < .001); gait speed improved: 0.10 \u00b1 0.24 m/s (p = .04); and five-times sit-to-stand improved by 2.1 seconds (p < .001). Subjective measures of late-life function improved (5.2 \u00b1 7.1 points, p = .003), as did Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information Systems mental and physical health scores (5.0 \u00b1 5.7 and 4.4 \u00b1 5.0, both p < .001). Participants wore their Fitbit 93.9% of all intervention days, and were overall satisfied with the trial (4.5/5.0, 1-5 low-high) and with Fitbit (4.0/5.0).",
        "A multicomponent obesity intervention incorporating a wearable device is feasible and acceptable to older adults with obesity, and potentially holds promise in enhancing health."
