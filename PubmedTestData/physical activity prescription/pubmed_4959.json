        "Few data are available concerning long-term outcome of patients after individually consulting a nutrition specialist, without entering a structured program. The objective of the present study was to evaluate outcome and predictors of body weight loss (BWL) after consulting in an outpatient nutrition clinic.",
        "Phone interview of 95 patients (age 46.1 +/- 1.4 years, BMI 33.8 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) out of 299 who consulted consecutively for the first time in an outpatient nutrition clinic for excessive body weight.",
        "The mean time interval between first visit and phone interview was 2.1 +/- 1.3 years. Average BWL was 6.7 +/- 1.2 kg for the entire group. Forty-eight patients (50.5%) had lost more than 5% of initial body weight and were considered to be successful. Initial BMI was associated with% BWL (r=0.42, p<0.0001). Underreporting of energy-intake at initial dietary history was positively associated with BWL (- 11.8 +/- 1.1 vs. - 5.1 +/- 3.9 kg, p<0.05) as well as the number of visits attended by the patient (p=0.04). No relation was found between sex, age and physical activity at initial visit, past history of dieting or time elapsed since first or last visit and BWL. In multivariate analysis under reporters had 4.3 times more chances to lose more than 5% of their body weight (p<0.05).",
        "Visiting a nutrition specialist to receive individual counseling and prescription of a balanced low calorie diet is part of a positive behavior change leading to body weight loss."
