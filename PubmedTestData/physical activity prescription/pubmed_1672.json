        "Key opinion leaders in sport and exercise nutrition advocate for a personalised and periodised approach to dietary assessment and prescription. However, practice has not advanced to this level, making recommendations from key researchers unexploited in the applied setting. Our objective was to advance traditional nutritional assessment methods (data collection and analysis) of athletic populations to place training and competition stimulus at the core of a personalised, periodised approach. We term this approach peri-training nutrition (PTN). <b>Novelty</b> The PTN assessment allows researchers and practitioners to effect monitor habitual nutritional practices of athletes specific to athlete aims, training adaptation stimuli, and competitive events."
