        "To provide practical guidelines for family physicians advising exercise in pregnancy.",
        "MEDLINE search was limited to the English literature between 1987 and 1995 with the key MeSH words exercise and pregnancy. Other sources included the Sports and Fitness Database between 1991 and 1995 and a manual search for relevant articles.",
        "After contraindications to exercise in pregnancy are excluded, the exercise prescription depends on the level of maternal fitness; the state of gestation; and the mode, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise. Pregnant women must be closely monitored, particularly those who want to maintain vigorous exercise programs.",
        "The available data suggest that moderate exercise has minimal risk to a woman and her fetus, if the woman is in good health, the pregnancy is monitored, and the exercise program is modified as necessary."
