        "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed to millions of women worldwide. Previous studies have suggested that HRT has both protective and harmful effects in asthma.",
        "Is HRT in menopause associated with new development of asthma?",
        "We undertook a nested case-control study based on the\u00a0Danish registers from June 1, 1995, through December 31, 2018. A diagnosis of\u00a0asthma was defined as two redeemed prescriptions of inhaled corticosteroids within\u00a02\u00a0years. HRT was defined as two redeemed prescriptions of female sex hormones\u00a0within 6\u00a0months. Data were analyzed using a conditional logistic regression model.",
        "We included 34,533 women with asthma vs\u00a0345,116 women without asthma\u00a0between 40 and 65 years of age. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age,\u00a0household income, and educational level, active HRT resulted in a hazard\u00a0ratio\u00a0(HR) of 1.63 (95%\u00a0CI, 1.55-1.71; P\u00a0< .001) of new asthma development.\u00a0Women with asthma who terminated HRT were likely to discontinue\u00a0their asthma treatment subsequently (HR, 2.12; 95%\u00a0CI, 1.94-2.33; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).",
        "HRT seems to play a role in the development of asthma in mature women. Clinicians prescribing HRT and women receiving HRT should be aware that new airway symptoms can develop, and discontinuation of HRT should be considered."
