        "Obesity is considered a major threat to health worldwide, and its treatment is difficult. The SCOOP project is aimed at describing the effects of treating obesity in everyday clinical practice, following a standard protocol of weight reduction.",
        "A total of 2472 obese or overweight men and women (with a body mass index of 27 units or more), aged between 35 and 74, were enrolled in different clinical facilities. Treatment included a 25% average reduction in caloric intake and a recommendation to take a brisk walk for at least 150 min per week. After 6 months, a second survey was then carried out.",
        "At the entry examination, patients exhibited high levels of most cardiovascular risk factors and estimated cardiovascular risks, and a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (14.1% in men; 6.3% in women), diabetes (30.5% in men; 25.2% in women) and metabolic syndrome (25.6% in men; 22.8% in women). After 6 months, 69% of all enrolled patients reported for a final examination. Levels of all cardiovascular risk factors were significantly reduced, including estimated cardiovascular risks (-20.4% in men and -12.6% in women). A targeted 10% reduction in body weight was achieved by 19% of patients. Changes in weight and cardiovascular risk factors were highly correlated with the self-reported compliance to prescriptions, and graded with the observed weight reduction. Benefits should be lowered by 30% if it is assumed that the patients who did not show up at the follow-up did not change their characteristics.",
