        "Exercise prescriptions that can be translated into clinical recommendations are clearly needed for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A pilot project was developed to document the effectiveness of a structured low-intensity walking protocol on capillary glucose control in GDM women. Ten GDM women followed conventional management of diet and insulin therapy, plus a low-intensity walking program (W) from diagnosis to delivery. Capillary glucose concentrations, insulin requirements, and pregnancy outcomes were compared with a matched cohort by body mass index (BMI), age, and insulin usage (20 GDM women who followed conventional management alone (C)). Baseline capillary glucose concentrations were not significantly different between the W and C groups. The W group had an average acute drop in capillary glucose concentration from pre- to post-exercise of 2.0 mmol x L(-1). In addition, the W group had significantly lower mean glucose concentrations in the fasted state and 1 h after meals than the C group in the week prior to delivery. These lower glucose concentrations were achieved while requiring fewer units of insulin per day (C, 0.50 +/- 0.37 U x kg(-1); W, 0.16 +/- 0.13 U x kg(-1); p < 0.05), injected less frequently. These results suggest an effective role in glucose regulation for this structured walking program."
