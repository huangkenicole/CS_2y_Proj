        "The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability and perceived utility of the provision of a wearable fitness device and an exercise prescription from a surgeon, prior to surgery for lung cancer.",
        "A single-arm, pre-post feasibility study was conducted with 30 participants scheduled for surgery to treat stage I, II or III lung cancer. Participants were given a Garmin Vivoactive HR device and a prescription for 150\u00a0min of moderately to vigorous exercise per week. Participants completed assessments on four occasions and completed a semi-structured interview on two occasions. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures, including synchronising the Garmin device and engaging in study assessments.",
        "Seventy-nine per cent of enrolled participants completed the pre-operative study activities. Seventy-one per cent of enrolled participants successfully synchronised their device during the pre-operative period. Data were transmitted from the device to the study team for an average of 70% of the pre-operative days.",
        "This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a pre-operative exercise program for patients scheduled to undergo surgery for lung cancer.",
        "The study protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov prior to the initiation of participant recruitment (NCT03162718)."
