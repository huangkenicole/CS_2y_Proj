        "To investigate Irish chartered physiotherapists' views on physical activity for patients with advanced cancer.",
        "A mixed methods study design was used. Eligibility criteria included Irish physiotherapists treating patients with advanced cancer. An online survey instrument was created, which included: (1) A quantitative section that explored physiotherapists' views on the role of physical activity for patients with advanced cancer; and (2) A qualitative section that explored physiotherapists' prescription of physical activity for two patient case studies. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.",
        "A total of 38 physiotherapists completed the study. In all, 94% (n\u00a0=\u00a036) of physiotherapists agreed with the statement \"being physically active is important for patients with advanced cancer\" and 80% (n\u00a0=\u00a030) stated a need for further information on prescribing physical activity to patients with advanced cancer. A content analysis of case study responses demonstrated physiotherapists have a number of concerns regarding the prescription of physical activity to patients with bone metastasis. Concerns center on patients' increased fracture risk, the presence of osteoporosis and the risk of falls in this patient group.",
        "The majority of physiotherapists perceived physical activity to be of benefit for patients living with advanced cancer. There is a need for more education and training around the prescription of physical activity programs to advanced cancer populations. Physiotherapists' responses suggest patients with advanced cancer have limited exposure to factors that may prompt increased physical activity levels post diagnosis."
