        "Multicomponent exercises involving eccentric contraction (ECC) exercise, chair yoga (CY) and tai chi (TC) are practiced extensively to treat older adults with chronic conditions. The study investigated the effect of CY and TC performance after various intensity of ECC exercise induced muscle pain, delayed onset of muscle sores (DOMS), and strength in sedentary older adults.",
        "Nine sedentary older adults with chronic condition(s) aged between 60 and 90 performed CY and TC after ECC exercise protocol for 9 weeks. The medical preprotocol, ECC exercise, CY, and TC performance, subjective (health activities of daily living [ADL] difficulty scale; Visual Analog Scale [VAS], and DOMS), objective (pressure pain threshold [PPT]), and medical postprotocol assessments were carried out and compared the physical status before and after the protocol.",
        "Our results show that functional limitations, DOMS, VAS, and PPT levels were improved in the CY and TC performed weeks 3, 4, 7, and 8 compared to ECC exercise weeks 2 and 6. The manual muscle testing (MMT), active range of motion (AROM), and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were improved and showed significant differences on the weak muscle groups. The mean Tinetti balance and gait score, and general endurance showed significant difference.",
        "Our findings have important implications for clinical exercise prescription as low perceived CY and TC, and ECC exercise might suit well for older adults with chronic conditions. Performing multicomponent exercises can help to reduce the risk of injury from falls and prevent age-related mobility, balance, and physical function decline in older adults."
