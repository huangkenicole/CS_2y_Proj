        "The anti-inflammatory diet is based on two diets that have been shown to have many positive health effects-the Mediterranean diet and the Okinawan diet. The anti-inflammatory diet is more than just a prescription for healthy food, but rather a way of life characterized by a plant-based diet and a pattern of living that includes eating a diverse range of locally grown foods eaten in season, conviviality, culinary activities, physical activity, and rest. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the burden and even prevent the development of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, depression, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and cognitive decline in adults. In children, there is emerging evidence demonstrating beneficial effects with regard to obesity, cardiorespiratory fitness, diabetes, fatty liver, academic performance, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and allergies. Maternal ingestion of the diet during pregnancy has also been shown to have positive effects on infants and children. [Pediatr Ann. 2019;48(6):e220-e225.]."
