        "Current exercise prescription guidelines for children recommend at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day. However, little is known about the efficacy of different cardiorespiratory exercise modalities prescribed to the pediatric cohort. Sixteen healthy children (8-12 years) completed 5-min trials of treadmill walking, cycling, and elliptical training in a randomized order. The treadmill walking speed was determined from measurements collected during a self-selected walking trial. The workloads for treadmill walking, cycling, and elliptical training were matched (40.3 W). Mechanical efficiency (ME%), perceived exertion (RPE), oxygen uptake, metabolic equivalents, and net energy expenditure were measured. ME% in walking was significantly higher than in cycling (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and elliptical training (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and cycling was significantly higher than elliptical training (P\u2009=\u20090.003). RPE in walking was significantly lower than in elliptical training (P\u2009=\u20090.006) but not from cycling (P\u2009=\u20090.314), and cycling resulted in significantly lower RPE than elliptical training (P\u2009=\u20090.021).",
        "Treadmill walking appears to be the most efficacious exercise prescription for otherwise healthy children; however, longitudinal studies need to be implemented to investigate the long-term benefits of each exercise modality."
