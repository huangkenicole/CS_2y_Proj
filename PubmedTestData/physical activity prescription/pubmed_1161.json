      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to compare the degree of exhaustion and trophic effects between continuous exercise (CE) and intermittent exercise (IE) at lactate threshold (LT) intensity. Seven healthy men (age: 43-69 years) performed the following three experimental tests in a randomized crossover order: (1) control; (2) CE, performed as a 20-min of cycling at LT intensity; and (3) IE, performed as 20 sets of a one-min bout of cycling at LT intensity with a 30-s rest between every two sets. Heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (LA), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured. The sampling timing in each test was as follows: 10 min before the onset of exercise, at the 25%, 50%, and 100% time points of exercise, and at 10 min after exercise. IE was found to be accompanied by a lower degree of exhaustion than CE in measures of HR, LA, RPE, catecholamines, and cortisol. In terms of trophic effects, both of IGF-1 and BDNF increased in CE, while a marginal increase of BDNF was observed in IE. The results indicated that IE induces lower stress than CE, but may not be effective for inducing trophic effects."
