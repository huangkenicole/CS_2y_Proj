        "Physical activity is reduced in people with asthma compared to the general population, especially in situations where patients have uncontrolled asthma symptoms, persistent airflow obstruction and other long-term medical problems, in particular obesity and anxiety. Exertional dyspnea, which is of multifactorial origin, is the main cause of reduced physical activity reduction and draws patients into a vicious circle further impairing quality of life and asthma control. Both the resumption of a regular physical activity, integrated into daily life, adapted to patients' needs and wishes as well as physical and environmental possibilities for mild to moderate asthmatics, and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for severe and/or uncontrolled asthmatics, improve control of asthma, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, quality of life, anxiety, depression and reduce exacerbations. A motivational interview to promote a regular programme of physical activity in mild to moderate asthma (steps 1 to 3) should be offered by all health professionals in the patient care pathway, within the more general framework of therapeutic education. The medical prescription of physical activities, listed in the Public Health Code for patients with long-term diseases, and pulmonary rehabilitation should be performed more often by specialists or the attending physician. Pulmonary rehabilitation addresses the needs of severe asthma patients (steps 4 and 5), and of any asthmatic patient with poorly controlled disease and/or requiring hospitalized for acute exacerbations, regardless of the level of airflow obstruction, and/or with associated comorbidities, and before prescribing biological therapies."
