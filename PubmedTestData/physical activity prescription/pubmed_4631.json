        "The effects of caffeine ingestion on the activities of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) during endurance exercise at low intensity were investigated using a power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability. Placebo or caffeine (300 mg) capsules were randomly administered to the subjects. Each subject ingested the samples 2 h before cycling on an ergometer for 30 min at an intensity corresponding to 40%-50% of his ventilatory threshold. The electrocardiogram, blood pressure (BP) and gas exchange parameters were monitored during rest and exercise. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in heart rate and systolic blood pressure between the trials. The spectrum integrated values of the low frequency power and total power components in the caffeine trial were significantly greater than in the placebo trial during exercise, which implied that activities of the ANS were augmented by caffeine. Caffeine also induced enhanced lipid oxidation as shown by the significantly lower respiratory gas exchange ratio and increases in diastolic blood pressure during exercise. The results shed some light upon the relationship between the activity of the ANS, energy metabolism and BP. In conclusion, the results suggest that caffeinated beverages have a potential to be useful supplements to the prescription of exercise for individuals who experience a depressed activity of the ANS. The results also suggest that the experiment protocol used in this study is a sensitive and noninvasive method for evaluating the effects of various foods and nutrients on the activity of the ANS."
