      "AbstractText": [
        "Statin therapy is a mainstay of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, but research shows that statin therapy alone is insufficient for preventing incident CVD and mortality. Combining statin medication with increased physical activity (PA) can lower mortality risk more than either statin or PA alone. However, PA levels often remain the same and may even decline following statin prescription. Additional information is needed to identify how to increase PA among statin users and determine the minimal length of an intervention (i.e., intervention dose) necessary to increase PA.",
        "The study aims to identify the required dose of a behavior change technique (BCT) intervention to increase PA among individuals on primary prevention statin therapy who have an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).",
        "The study will utilize the modified time-to-event continual reassessment method (TiTE-CRM) in 42 participants. We expect insights relating to dose-efficacy models and BCTs (Behavior Change Techniques) to improve PA in adults at risk for CVD. This trial will also examine potential mechanisms of action (MoAs) for interventions to increase PA, identify any effect a PA intervention may have on medication adherence, and determine whether participants respond uniformly to their respective behavioral interventions.",
        "This trial was approved by the Northwell Health Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all participants will complete informed consent. The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. All publications resulting from this series of personalized trials will follow the CONSORT reporting guidelines.",
        "This trial is registered on www.",
        "gov (Number NCT05273723)."
