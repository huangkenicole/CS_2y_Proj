        "This study aimed to produce a list of the top 10 research priorities regarding physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep in pregnancy. Using the Delphi methodology, pregnant/postpartum individuals (<i>N</i> = 118), exercise professionals and healthcare providers (<i>N</i> = 55) listed up to 10 questions perceived as unanswered regarding physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep in pregnancy (Round 1). Respondents rated the proposed questions on a Likert importance scale (Round 2), and the sum of ratings received were totaled. Questions of priority regarding physical activity among pregnant/postpartum individuals (<i>N</i> = 67), healthcare providers and exercise professionals (<i>N</i> = 22) pertained to <i>exercise prescription, impact of exercise on maternal and fetal outcomes and impact of exercise on pregnancy conditions, special population groups</i> and <i>clinical education and access to information.</i> Sedentary behavior priorities included the <i>impact of sedentary behavior on maternal and fetal outcomes</i>, <i>sedentary recommendations</i> and <i>exercise and sedentary positioning</i>. Sleep research priorities included the <i>impact of pregnancy on sleep, safety, sleeping aids</i> and the effect of <i>exercise on sleep.</i> Pregnant/postpartum women, healthcare providers and exercise professionals prioritized questions that have in part been addressed by existing research, highlighting a need for improved knowledge translation from research to practice. They have also identified novel questions that warrant prioritization within future research."
