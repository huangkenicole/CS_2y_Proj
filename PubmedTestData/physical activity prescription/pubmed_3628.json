        "Several studies have examined the effects of balance training in elderly individuals following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), although findings appear to be equivocal.",
        "This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effects of balance training on walking capacity, balance-specific performance and other functional outcome measures in elderly individuals following TKA.",
        "Data sources: Pubmed, PEDro, Cinahl, SportDiscus, Scopus. Eligibility criteria: Data were aggregated following the population-intervention-comparison-outcome (PICO) principles. Eligibility criteria included: (1) randomised controlled trials; (2) studies with comparative groups; (3) training interventions were incorporated post-TKA; and (4) outcome measures included walking capacity, balance-specific performance measures, subjective measures of physical function and pain and knee range-of-motion.",
        "Elderly individuals (65\u2009+\u2009years) who underwent total knee arthroplasty.",
        "Balance interventions that consisted of balance exercises, which were compared to control interventions that did not involve balance exercises, or to a lesser extent. Participants also undertook usual physiotherapy care in conjunction with either the balance and/or control intervention. The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 32\u00a0weeks with outcome measures reported immediately following the intervention. Of these, four studies also reported follow-up measures ranging from 6 to 12\u00a0months post-interventions. Study appraisal: PEDro scale.",
        "Quantitative analysis was conducted by generating forest plots to report on standardised mean differences (SMD; i.e. effect size), test statistics for statistical significance (i.e. Z values) and inter-trial heterogeneity by inspecting I<sup>2</sup>. A meta-regression was also conducted to determine whether training duration predicted the magnitude of SMD.",
        "Balance training exhibited significantly greater improvement in walking capacity (SMD\u2009=\u20090.57; Z\u2009=\u20096.30; P\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200935%), balance-specific performance measures (SMD\u2009=\u20091.19; Z\u2009=\u20097.33; P\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090%) and subjective measures of physical function (SMD\u2009=\u20090.46; Z\u2009=\u20094.19; P\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090%) compared to conventional training immediately post-intervention. However, there were no differences in subjective measures of pain (SMD\u2009=\u20090.77; Z\u2009=\u20091.63; P\u2009>\u20090.05; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200995%) and knee range-of-motion (SMD\u2009=\u20090.05; Z\u2009=\u20090.39; P\u2009>\u20090.05; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20091%) between interventions. At the 6- to 12-month follow-up period, improvement in combined measures of walking capacity and balance performance (SMD\u2009=\u2009041; Z\u2009=\u20093.55; P\u2009<\u20090.001; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090%) were significantly greater for balance training compared to conventional training, although no differences were observed for subjective measures of physical function and pain (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26; Z\u2009=\u20092.09; P\u2009>\u20090.05; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090%). Finally, the training duration significantly predicted subjective measures of pain and physical function (r<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.85; standardised \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.92; P\u2009<\u20090.001), although this was not observed for walking capacity and balance-specific performance measures (r<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.02; standardised \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13; P\u2009=\u20090.48).",
        "A number of outcome measures indicated high inter-trial heterogeneity and only articles published in English were included.",
        "Balance training improved walking capacity, balance-specific performance and functional outcome measures for elderly individuals following TKA. These findings may improve clinical decision-making for appropriate post-TKA exercise prescription to minimise falls risks and optimise physical function."
