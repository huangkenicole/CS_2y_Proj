        "It is evident that those delivering health promotional services need training not only in the technical aspects of their profession, but in terms of enhancement of their organizational and management skills as well. Tasks associated with testing, data analysis, life style prescription, counselling, education, and safe and effective direction of program functions obviously require a multi-faceted staff. Screening and testing of fitness/wellness program clients is designed to identify those who can safely participate with likelihood of achieving their goals. Data from these procedures are used to formulate exercise and nutritional prescriptions and to serve as motivation. Counselling and educational efforts are aimed at servicing special needs of clients, providing motivation, increasing program visibility in the community and at enhancing program adherence. In view of the fact that fitness/wellness programs affect the health of participants and that certain aspects of these programs are hazardous, well worked-out schemes for providing emergency assistance and for otherwise protecting participants from harm must be in line and well-practiced. This need is enhanced by the fact that fitness/wellness programs and those who are associated with them are legally liable for physiological and mechanical accidents that can be traced to negligence."
