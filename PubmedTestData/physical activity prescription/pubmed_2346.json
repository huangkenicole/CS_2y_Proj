        "Appropriate exercise is the effective way for the prevention and treatment of heart diseases. Its mechanism has not been completely elucidated, and the safe and effective exercise prescription needs to be studied systematically. Exercises give rise to secretion of various cell factors, effective stem cell mobilization, physiological hypertrophy and differentiation and proliferation of cardiomyocytes. The cell sources of adult cardiomyocyte proliferation included viable cardiomyocytes, cardiac stem/progenitor cells, bone marrow stem cells, peripheral stem cells. Stem cell mobilization, homing and differentiation are the cellular basis of myocardial repair after injury. From the potential of cardiomyocyte proliferation, stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction and cardiac myocyte proliferation induced by exercise, this review focused on the stem cells mobilization promoted by aerobic exercise, the possible mechanism of cardiac repair and functional amelioration induced by the differentiation of those stem cells after myocardial infarction, the problems remained to be further studied and correlative research progress."
