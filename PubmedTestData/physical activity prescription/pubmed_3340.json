        "To examine behavioral risk factors in relation to fatigue after spinal cord injury (SCI), specifically cardiovascular-related behaviors, prescription medication use, and alcohol and cigarette use.",

        "A medical university in the southeastern United States.",
        "Adults (N=2245) at least 1 year post-SCI from a large specialty hospital in the Southeast responded to a mail-in survey.",
        "Not applicable.",
        "The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale-5-item version was used to assess disabling fatigue.",
        "Of participants, 8.3% had disabling fatigue, 45.3% reported fatigue rarely to never impacted their life, and 46.4% reported having some fatigue. Persons who reported having less exercise than others with a similar injury level were 2.49 times as likely to have disabling fatigue as persons who reported more exercise. Those with a fair or poor diet were also more likely to have disabling fatigue. Use of prescription medication to treat pain was associated with disabling fatigue, as was being CAGE positive. Among nonbehavioral variables, race and injury severity were significantly associated with disabling fatigue.",
        "We identified several behavioral predictors of disabling fatigue, including cardiovascular risk factors, prescription medication use, and alcohol use. These factors are important because they are able to be modified and could be potential factors for prevention or intervention."
