        "Exercise heart rate (HR) ranges based on peak HR, age-predicted maximal HR and peak oxygen consumption were compared to determine which method is most likely to result in an exercise prescription within guidelines determined from exercise respiratory measurements (upper limit--ventilatory threshold; lower limit--50% peak oxygen consumption). Exercise prescriptions based on either 80% peak HR or 70% peak measured oxygen consumption were significantly more likely to be within these guidelines (p less than 0.05) than other criteria tested; there was no significant difference between these 2 methods. Recommended exercise intensity based on 85% peak HR and 80% peak oxygen uptake resulted in a large percentage of patients with a heart rate above the ventilatory threshold (46% and 54%, respectively), whereas target HR derived from 75% peak HR and 60% peak oxygen consumption resulted in many patients with a heart rate below the lower limit (38% and 42%, respectively). Exercise prescription based on predicted maximal HR was of little value, regardless of the percentage used to determine target heart rate. The best methods identified in this study yielded an exercise intensity exceeding ventilatory threshold 15 to 20% of the time. Exercise prescription based on direct assessment of the ventilatory threshold is therefore preferred."
