      "AbstractText": [
        "The number of people living with the side effects of breast cancer treatment (eg, loss of muscular mass and muscular strength, upper-limb mobility and disability, lymphedema, cardiac toxicity, and reduced quality of life) is increasing yearly. These consequences can be improved through exercise, specially combining resistance and aerobic training. Previous exercise trials have not been consistent in applying training principles and standardized reporting, and this partly explains the variability in obtained results. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a 12-week supervised resistance exercise program combined with home-based aerobic exercise, compared with home-based aerobic exercise only, on muscular strength and several aspects of health-related quality of life in breast cancer survivors. To maximize transparency, replicability, and clinical applicability, the intervention is described following the consensus on exercise reporting template.",
        "This study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial in which 60 female breast cancer survivors, who have completed central treatments of the disease in the last 5 years, will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group that will perform a total of 24 progressive resistance training sessions for 12 weeks (ie, 2 weeks of individual training and 10 weeks of micro-group training) and will be requested to undertake 10,000 steps/d, or a control group that will be requested to undertake 10,000 steps/d, only. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and at week 12. Primary outcome measure is peak isometric muscular strength of the lower- and upper-body, assessed with several exercises through an electromechanical dynamometer. Secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, upper-joint mobility and disability, health-related quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, depression, life satisfaction, and presence of lymphedema.",
        "This study aims to investigate the extent to which a 12-week supervised and progressive resistance exercise program, in addition to home-based aerobic physical activity, might improve muscular strength and health-related quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The comprehensive description of the intervention will likely contribute to enhancing exercise prescription in this population.",
