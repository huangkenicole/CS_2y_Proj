        "To quantify changes in differential ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) across a 2-wk repeated-sprint-training intervention that improved high-intensity intermittent-running ability and linear speed of semiprofessional soccer players.",
        "Thirteen players completed 3 (sessions 1-3) or 4 (sessions 4-6) sets of 7 sprints (group 1 [n = 7]: 30-m straight; group 2 [n = 6]: 2 \u00d7 10-m shuttle), with 20 s and 4 min of recovery between sprints and sets, respectively. Postset perceptions of breathlessness (RPE-B) and leg-muscle exertion (RPE-L) were rated using the CR100 scale.",
        "Overall, RPE-B (mean [SD]: 46 [13] arbitrary units [AU], \"hard\") was most likely higher than RPE-L (39 [13] AU, \"somewhat hard,\" mean difference: 8 AU; 90% confidence limits [CLs]: \u00b12). Set-to-set increases in dRPE (in AU; 90% CL: approximately \u00b12) were large in session 1 (RPE-B: 15; RPE-L: 14), moderate in sessions 2-5 (RPE-B: 7-10; RPE-L: 7-8), and small (RPE-B: 6) to moderate (RPE-L: 7) in session 6. Across the intervention, RPE-B reduced moderately in sets 3 (-13; 90% CL: \u00b14) and 4 (-12; 90% CL: \u00b112) and RPE-L reduced by a small magnitude in set 3 (-5; 90% CL: \u00b16). The set 4 change in RPE-L was unclear (-11; 90% CL: \u00b113).",
        "The authors observed systematic intrasession and intersession changes in dRPE across a 2-wk repeated-sprint-training intervention, with a fixed prescription of external load that improved semiprofessional soccer players' high-speed-running abilities. These findings could support dRPE as a measure of internal load and highlight its usefulness in evaluating repeated-sprint-training dose-response."
