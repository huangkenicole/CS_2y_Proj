      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to assess the different impacts of aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on pre-diabetes and its possible influencing factor (obesity) to identify which exercise intervention mode was better for pre-diabetes to control their blood glucose levels.",
        "Single-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from Southwest Hospital between February 2016 and May 2017 and randomly divided into three groups using stratified randomization: aerobic exercise (A), resistance exercise (R), and control (C). The effects of each group were analyzed, and the relationship with obesity was investigated following a 12-week intervention.",
        "Eighty participants were enrolled (9 were lost, and 1 was excluded). Finally, 26 participants were included in group A, 23 in group R, and 21 in group C. In groups A and R, FPG, OGTT 2-h PG, and HOMA2-IR decreased by 6.17% (P = 0.001) and 4.81% (P = 0.019), 20.39% (P < 0.001) and 16.50% (P < 0.001), and 8.34% (P = 0.026) and 18.31% (P = 0.001, superior to that in group A), respectively (all P < 0.001 compared with group C, with no significant differences between groups A and R). The ratio of reversal to euglycemia was 69.2% (P = 0.003 compared with group C) in group A and 43.5% (P = 0.213 compared with group C) in group R. The decreased ratio of GSP in group R was greater (65.2%, P = 0.008 compared with group C) compared with group A (38.5%, P = 0.355 compared with group C). Decreases in the parameters BMI (3.1 \u00b1 3.2% P < 0.001, moderately positive correlation with the decreased FPG level, r = 0.498, P = 0.010, two-tailed) and waist circumference (3.1 \u00b1 2.7% P < 0.001) were noted in group A, but no significant correlations were noted between other indicators in group R.",
        "Both resistance and aerobic exercise can control and reverse IGR. Compared with aerobic exercise, resistance exercise may be superior in terms of GSP and IR improvement. Aerobic exercise decreases blood glucose levels through weight loss. However, the effect of resistance exercise might not be mediated via weight loss and obesity control.",
