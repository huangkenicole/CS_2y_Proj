        "Physical therapy and occupational therapy are essential for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases equal in rank to any drug therapy. They have enough evidence and are part of all current guidelines even if mostly not specified. In the German social security system the doctor prescribing physical therapy or occupational therapy has to act according to the different rules and forms as described in the current \"Heilmittel Richtlinie\" (Remedy directive) effective since July 2011. The multiple formal conditions and requirements of prescriptions are described in detail. Of special interest is that the global diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can no longer be used as the reason or justification for the individual prescription but detailed sub-diagnoses, regarding the essential ICF domains of structural damage, functional impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction as well as individual context factors are necessary. Of special interest is the fact that the prescribing doctor is no longer responsible for the formal correctness of prescriptions but the performing therapist, who will not be reimbursed if the prescription shows even minor formal errors. Another important improvement is the newly introduced long-term prescription of physical and occupational therapy. This facilitates the application of these therapies in the multimodal treatment regimen of rheumatic diseases."
