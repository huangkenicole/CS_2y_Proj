        "Physicians often overlook exercise as a treatment or prophylactic measure for many common diseases and ailments. It can be used to treat comorbidities including obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, cancer, and low back pain. Education on the general physical activity guidelines as well as easy exercise prescription methods can improve the ability of physicians to prescribe exercise as a therapeutic option. In addition, identifying barriers to compliance with exercise and ways to overcome these barriers is also necessary in order to use therapeutic exercise effectively."
