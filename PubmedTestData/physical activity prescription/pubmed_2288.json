        "Whitehead, S, Till, K, Weaving, D, Dalton-Barron, N, Ireton, M, and Jones, B. Duration-specific peak average running speeds of European Super League Academy rugby league match play. J Strength Cond Res 35(7): 1964-1971, 2021-This study aimed to quantify the duration-specific peak average running speeds of Academy-level rugby league match play, and compare between playing positions. Global positioning system data were collected from 149 players competing across 9 teams during 21 professional Academy (under-19) matches. Players were split into 6 positions: hookers (n = 40), fullbacks (n = 24), halves (n = 47), outside backs (n = 104), middles (n = 118), and backrow forwards (n = 104). Data were extracted and the 10-Hz raw velocity files exported to determine the peak average running speeds, via moving averages of speed (m\u00b7min-1), for 10- and 30-second, and 1- to 5- and 10-minute durations. The data were log transformed and analyzed using linear mixed-effect models followed by magnitude-based inferences, to determine differences between positions. Differences in the peak average running speeds are present between positions, indicating the need for position-specific prescription of velocity-based training. Fullbacks perform possibly to most likely greater average running speeds than all other positions, at each duration, except at 10 seconds vs. outside backs. Other differences are duration dependent. For 10 seconds, the average running speed is most likely greater for outside backs vs. the hookers, middles, and backrow forwards, but likely to most likely lower for 10 minutes. Hookers have possibly trivial or lower average speed for 10 seconds vs. middles and backrow forwards, but very likely greater average running speed for 10 minutes. The identified peak average running speeds of Academy-level match play seem similar to previously reported values of senior professional level."
