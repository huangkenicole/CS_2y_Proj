        "Rubber-based resistance (RBR) bands and standard link steel (SLS) chains are 2 forms of variable resistance used throughout the strength and conditioning and rehabilitation communities. The purpose of this study was to quantify the tension of RBR bands and the mass of SLS chains as a function of displacement (increasing in 10-cm increments). Five sets of RBR bands (14-, 22-, 30-, 48-, and 67-mm widths) and 5 sets of SLS chains (6-, 8-, 10-, 13-, 16-mm diameters) were measured using a load cell and a force plate. The RBR bands exhibited curvilinear tension-deformation relationships and were best represented (R >or= 0.99) by second-order polynomial functions, whereas the SLS chains exhibited linear mass-displacement relationships and were best represented (R = 1) by first-order polynomial functions. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in force outputs between the load cell and the force plate testing, although the strain gauge is a relatively cheap and viable method of quantifying the variable resistance of chains and bands. The strength and conditioning practitioner when purchasing bands needs to be aware of resting length differences (3.5-5.2%), which resulted in mean tension imbalances of 8-19% in the same color band. This study provides the strength and conditioning coach and clinician with a methodology to quantify variable resistance, which may be useful in the prescription of specific loading intensities."
