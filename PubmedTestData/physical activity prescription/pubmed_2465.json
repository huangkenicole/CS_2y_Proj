        "As current pharmacological treatments of dementia have only modest effects, nonpharmacological treatments like exercise interventions have attracted much research interest. This review summarizes recent evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise in preventing and treating neurocognitive disorders.",
        "Recent evidence suggests that exercise may prevent cognitive impairment in older adults with normal cognition. Besides, it may slow down the deterioration in older adults who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. But inconsistent findings have been reported, and larger randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its treatment value. This article also reviews existing evidence-based clinical guidelines advising on the optimal format and intensity of exercise interventions for older adults with different cognitive functions.",
        "There is a growing body of evidence supporting the cognitive benefits of exercise for older adults with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia. Exercise is a relatively safe and low-cost lifestyle intervention and should be recommended for older adults to prevent dementia and treat cognitive impairment. However, as the factors affecting the efficacy of exercise in improving cognition are complex, exercise prescription should be individually tailored."
