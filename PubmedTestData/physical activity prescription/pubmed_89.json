        "Many researchers are of the opinion that the incorporation of physical activity prescription (PAP) into healthcare is a move that can add value to healthcare, but there are others who think this move would rather disrupt clinical practice. This study, therefore, examined the influence of physicians' PAP (PPAP) on healthcare quality indicators.",
        "The study adopted a correlational approach and was performed at a primary care facility. Participants were 605 patients in wards and the outpatient department of a district healthcare facility. A self-reported questionnaire was used to gather data. Structural equation modeling was used to present findings.",
        "The study found that PPAP has a positive influence on care quality (\u03b2 = 0.4, critical ratio = 10.59, and p = .000), patient satisfaction, and patient loyalty. Physical activity prescription also has a positive indirect influence on patient loyalty through patient satisfaction.",
        "Physicians' physical activity prescription in healthcare can improve healthcare quality indicators. A key implication of our results is that the incorporation of PPAP into healthcare could be in harmony with the key mission of hospitals. Physical activity prescription in healthcare could be a way to satisfy and retain patients."
