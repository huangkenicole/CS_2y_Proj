        "In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) to develop and conduct the Scripted Surge Pharmacy Pandemic Exercise to assess the capacity of pharmacies to administer vaccines and dispense medications during a severe influenza pandemic and to evaluate their various approaches to this activity. A mass merchant pharmacy and a supermarket pharmacy were recruited in 2 different states. At each pharmacy, 2 consecutive 90-minute exercise runs were completed in which actors, simulating patients, presented themselves to the pharmacy counter and requested a vaccine and/or prescription(s). Each run was slightly different in terms of patient flow, staffing, and physical configuration. Individual plays were timed, and a quality assessment was conducted as each patient left the store. Despite the complexities of the pandemic scenario, the number of vaccines administered and prescriptions dispensed surpassed what that pharmacy could typically accomplish during current peak hours of operation. Furthermore, the number of requests successfully processed increased between the first and second runs at each site, suggesting that processing efficiency improved with practice and experience. Few unexpected outcomes were observed, most of which were attributable to exercise artificialities, and they were judged unlikely to occur under real-world scenarios and routine pharmacy practice. The experience gained from this exercise indicates that pharmacies can likely play an important role in improving access to vaccinations and medications during a future pandemic."
