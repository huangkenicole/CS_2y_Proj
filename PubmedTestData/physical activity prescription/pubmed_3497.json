        "Tendinopathy is a condition often associated with pain and functional and sport performance limitations. While targeted exercise prescriptions are often effective, many patients with tendinopathy develop persistent symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests a possible link between nervous system sensitization and tendinopathy. If so, identifying and treating specific pain mechanisms may improve outcomes.",
        "Three patients were seen in physical therapy for complaints of ongoing chronic tendon pain and self-reported disability, despite being treated previously and receiving evidence-informed care. Upon examination, each patient demonstrated signs consistent with possible dysfunction of central pain mechanisms. Joint mobilization, pain neuroscience education, and aerobic exercise were primary interventions in each case to decrease pain and improve function.",
        "The 3 patients were treated for 5 sessions over the course of 8 weeks. Clinically significant improvement was noted in measures of pain, self-reported function, and pressure pain thresholds. At discharge, all patients were able to run without symptoms, and improvement was maintained at 1-year follow-up.",
        "Tendinopathy, while often described as local pain and dysfunction, may be associated with dysfunction of the nervous system. Identifying and treating pain mechanisms in addition to relevant impairments may be an appropriate intervention approach for individuals with tendinopathy.",
