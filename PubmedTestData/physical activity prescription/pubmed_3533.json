        "Testing to determine blood lactate thresholds for prescription of rowing training is usually conducted separately from performance testing (i.e. 2000m time trial). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the testing required to determine blood lactate thresholds and performance in elite rowers could be reduced by undertaking a single test combining incremental exercise with a 2000m time trial. Ten elite rowers (age 20.9+/-2.1 years, mean+/-S.D.) performed, on separate occasions and in random order, an incremental seven-step rowing test (INCR), a 2000m time trial (2k), or a combined test involving the performance of six incremental submaximal workloads followed by 15min of recovery and then a 2000m time trial (2-in-1). Physiological and performance parameters (blood lactate thresholds, accumulated oxygen deficit, heart rate, work parameters) determined during 2-in-1 were not significantly different from those determined during INCR or 2k, except for peak oxygen uptake which was higher during 2-in-1 compared with INCR (4.23+/-0.22 versus 4.14+/-0.20lmin(-1), p=0.02), and peak rating of perceived exertion which was lower during 2-in-1 compared with INCR (19.4+/-0.2 versus 19.9+/-0.1, p=0.02). We conclude that physiological and performance parameters that have traditionally been assessed during separate incremental exercise and 2000m time trial testing in elite rowers can be validly determined during a single combined exercise test."
