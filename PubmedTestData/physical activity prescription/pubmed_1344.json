        "Great attention is now being paid to effective policies and programs to promote physical activity among adolescents, girls consistently found to be less active than boys. The aim of this study was to assess gender differences in perceived barriers for physical activity practice and their relationship with physical activity levels and physical condition among adolescents.",
        "A cross-sectional study was conducted in February-April 2017 among students (n\u00a0=\u00a0368) in the last year of two state high schools in Florence (Italy). Participants underwent the measurements of anthropometric parameters (height, weight, waist, and hip circumferences), blood pressure and administration of 3 standardized questionnaires (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Mediterranean Diet Score Quiz, and Barriers to Being Active Quiz). Gender differences were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted for age and body mass index). The prevalence of participants who reached recommended levels was lower among girls compared to boys (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.17-0.43). The number of perceived barriers to physical activity was higher among girls than among boys (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.29-1.79), lack of energy for exercise and lack of willpower being the two barriers most frequently reported by girls. At multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis, gender (female), and positivity of at least one perceived barrier (score\u00a0\u2265\u00a05) were independently selected as the main determinants of non-compliance with WHO criteria for physical activity.",
        "Exercise professionals should be aware of the barriers that young girls can face during exercise prescription and be able to contrast them with useful individual strategies."
