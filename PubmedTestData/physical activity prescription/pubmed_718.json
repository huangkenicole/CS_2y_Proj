        "Aging involves a marked decline in physical function and especially muscle power. Thus, optimal resistance exercise (RE) to improve muscle power is required for exercise prescription. An eccentric lowering phase immediately before a concentric lift (ECC-CON) may augment concentric power production, due to various proposed mechanisms (e.g., elastic recoil, pre-activation, stretch reflex, contractile history), when compared with a concentric contraction alone (CON-Only). This study compared the effect of a prior eccentric lowering phase on older adult concentric power performance (ECC-CON vs. CON-Only) during a common multiple joint isoinertial RE (i.e., leg press) with a range of loads. Twelve healthy older adult males completed two measurement sessions, consisting of ECC-CON and CON-Only contractions, performed in a counterbalanced order using 20-80% of one repetition maximum [% 1RM] loads on an instrumented isoinertial leg press dynamometer that measured power, force, and velocity. Muscle activation was assessed with surface electromyography (sEMG). For mean power ECC-CON>CON-Only, with a pronounced effect of load on the augmentation of power by ECC-CON (+19 to +55%, 35-80% 1RM, all p\u2009<\u20090.032). Similarly, for mean velocity ECC-CON>CON-Only, especially as load increased (+15 to 54%, 20-80% 1RM, all p\u2009<\u20090.005), but mean force showed more modest benefits of ECC-CON (+9 to 14%, 50-80% 1RM, all p\u2009<\u20090.05). In contrast, peak power and velocity were similar for ECC-CON and CON-Only with all loads. Knee and hip extensor sEMG were similar for both types of contractions. In conclusion, ECC-CON contractions produced greater power, and velocity performance in older adults than CON-Only and may provide a superior stimulus for chronic power development."
