        "The aim of this investigation was to quantify professional rugby union player activity profiles after the most intense (peak) passages of matches. Movement data were collected from 30 elite and 30 subelite professional rugby union athletes across respective competitive seasons. Accelerometer-derived PlayerLoad and global navigation satellite system-derived measures of mean speed and metabolic power were analyzed using a rolling-average method to identify the most intense 5- to 600-second passages (ie,\u00a0worst-case scenarios) within matches. Player activity profiles immediately post their peak 5- to 600-second match intensity were identified using 5 epoch duration-matched intervals. Mean speed, metabolic power, and PlayerLoad declined sharply (\u223c29%-86%) after the most intense 5 to 600\u00a0seconds of matches. Following the most intense periods of rugby matches, exercise intensity declined below the average match-half intensity 81% of the time and seldom returned to or exceeded it, likely due to a host of individual physical and physiological characteristics, transient and/or accumulative fatigue, contextual factors, and pacing strategies. Typically, player exercise intensities after the most intense passages of matches were similar between match halves, positional groups, and levels of rugby competition. Accurate identification of the peak exercise intensities of matches and movement thereafter using novel methodologies has improved the limited understanding of professional rugby union player activity profiles following the worst-case scenarios of matches. Findings of the present study may inform match-representative training prescription, monitoring, and tactical match decisions (eg,\u00a0substitutions and positional changes)."
