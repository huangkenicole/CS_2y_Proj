        "This study examined the relationship between depression, benzodiazepine (BZD)/nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (non-BZD), and other risk factors in a national sample of Taiwan's elderly diabetic patients.",
        "Data were drawn from the 2005 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey and adults aged 65 years and older. A total of 1331 subjects were included in this study. The Chinese version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to evaluate patients' depression symptoms.",
        "The rates of depression in the diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-DM groups were 13.5% (39/288) and 9.8% (102/1043) and the average ages were 73.7 and 73.4 years, respectively. In multivariate regression, the odds ratio of depression was 1.66-fold higher among BZD/non-BZD users (95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.51, model 2) than among those without BZD/non-BZD use. In addition, hyperlipidaemia, poor physical function, and antidepressant use were associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, a monthly household income of NT$30 000-NT$49 999, exercise, and betel chewing were associated with a lower risk of depression. We performed an additional logistic analysis for which the odds ratio of depression significantly increased to 1.52 in non-DM elderly patients (95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.19) who were prescribed BZD/non-BZD. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the odds ratio of depression in the DM elderly regardless of BZD/non-BZD use, although there was a slight tendency for depression among those who used BZD/non-BZD.",
        "Depression in non-DM Taiwanese elderly patients was found to be associated with BZD/non-BZD use, whereas depression in DM Taiwanese elderly patients was not found to be associated with BZD/non-BZD use."
