        "The identification of factors which may influence a patient's decision to self-medicate.",
        "Descriptive, cross-sectional study of the adult population (at least 16\u00a0years old), using data from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain, which included 22\u00a0188 subjects. Logistic regression models enabled us to estimate the effect of each analysed variable on self-medication.",
        "In total, 14\u00a0863 (67%) individuals reported using medication (prescribed and non-prescribed) and 3274 (22.0%) of them self-medicated. Using logistic regression and stratifying by age, four different models have been constructed. Our results include different variables in each of the models to explain self-medication, but the one that appears on all four models is education level. Age is the other important factor which influences self-medication. Self-medication is strongly associated with factors related to socio-demographic, such as sex, educational level or age, as well as several health factors such as long-standing illness or physical activity.",
        "When our data are compared to those from previous Spanish surveys carried out in 2003 and 2006, we can conclude that self-medication is increasing in Spain."
