        "Having stressed how very common varicose disorders are, and how varied in different parts of the world, the author considers the various known epidermiological factors: hereditary and endocrinian, but also acquired, and in which modern life and its increasingly sedentary character plays a big part. The second part draws attention to the necessity of doctor-patient collaboration : the doctor aiming at finding effective prevention... Then the author considers in turn the prescriptions of oestroprogestatives, compression, or correction of the disorders connected with venous stasis in the foot. The varicose patient himself must make an effort to adapt to his daily life, to live according to hygienic principles in which physical activity has place; this leads the author to consider sports, either as beneficial of harmful to the patient."
