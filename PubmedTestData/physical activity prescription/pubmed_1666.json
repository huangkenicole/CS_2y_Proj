        "Over 1 million Canadian children are estimated to have a mental health disorder, which are commonly treated with medications, such as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Estimates suggest that SGA prescriptions to children are increasing in Canada. Although these medications are important and lifesaving components of psychiatric treatment, they are not without side effects. For some children, SGA treatment is associated with adverse metabolic complications including rapid weight gain, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and risk for type 2 diabetes. It is not clear why these complications develop, but it is assumed that SGAs stimulate appetite and food intake, and reduce resting energy expenditure leading to weight gain and that the metabolic complications occur secondary to the weight gain. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these complications is key to being able to identify children at risk and prevent and optimize treatment. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the literature pertaining to the weight gain and metabolic complications in children treated with SGAs, highlighting the scope of the problem and the current limited research on how diet and physical activity can be used to prevent or lessen the severity of the metabolic complications and improve the long-term health trajectories of SGA-treated children. <b>Novelty:</b> Children are increasingly being treated with second-generation antipsychotics for mental health disorders. Dietary and physical activity assessments are not commonly considered in clinical settings. Randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions are needed to determine the effectiveness of mitigating the cardiometabolic complications in second-generation antipsychotic-treated children."
