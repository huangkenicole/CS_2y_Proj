        "Running test MC-108 is used in Russian cosmonauts as a compulsory procedure during on-earth training as well in long-term flights. It's a test of graded intensity on treadmill with artificial rubber belt attraction nearly 60-70% of body weight. It permits to evaluate cosmonauts physical state and to make individual prescriptions for current state optimisation and to prepare them for successful come back to earth gravity. The control is based on objective test results as well on evaluations of qualified on-earth experts. Future distant flights will restrict connections with earth and then only computer will be able to control on-board crew members' physical training. Special software is required to make objective physical state evaluation and training prescriptions. The purpose of the investigation is a first step on this way--to evaluate the validity of certain ergometric and pulse indices usually registered during cosmonaut on-board testing. This is required for future computer expert system development."
