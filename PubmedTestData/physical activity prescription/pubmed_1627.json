        "One hundred sixty-eight physicians responded to a survey to determine their attitudes and practices related to exercise and the development of exercise prescriptions. The mean age was 45.5 +/- 10.8 years, with the majority being male (86.7%).",
        "The survey found that 48% of the physicians required an exercise history as part of their initial examination and 91% encouraged their patients to participate in regular exercise programs. Seventy percent of the physicians did not develop exercise prescriptions and only 23% were familiar with the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines related to the development of exercise prescriptions. Only a small number of physicians (3%) had ever taken a college-level course related to exercise physiology and the development of exercise programs. The majority (78%) felt that there was a definite need in medical school for a course related to the medical aspects of exercise.",
        "Results of this investigation indicate that while physicians support exercise for health promotion and rehabilitation, greater emphasis needs to be placed on physician involvement in promoting and/or prescribing exercise."
