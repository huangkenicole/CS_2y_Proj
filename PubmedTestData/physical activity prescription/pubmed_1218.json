        "MyDispense is an innovative, web-based program which simulates a community pharmacy. Use of this software may assist students' comprehension of validating controlled substance prescriptions by determining if prescriptions contain errors or omissions.",
        "Fourteen MyDispense practice exercises were created and implemented into a required second-year pharmacy law course. Completion of the MyDispense exercises and performance on the pharmacy law midterm exam were recorded. A questionnaire was administered to students to receive feedback on the exercises.",
        "There were complete data on all 94 student pharmacists enrolled in the didactic course. Thirty-five students (37%) completed all MyDispense exercises, 15 students (16%) completed some of the exercises, and 44 (47%) did not complete any of the exercises. Linear regression results indicate that students who completed more MyDispense exercises were significantly more likely to score higher on the midterm than those who completed fewer exercises (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.28, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Students reported moderate to high exercise value and a willingness to use the software in preparation for future pharmacy law examinations.",
        "MyDispense provided a platform for students to apply controlled substance laws to the prescription validation process in the community pharmacy setting. Completion of practice exercises in MyDispense was shown to positively impact student performance on a pharmacy law midterm. Students valued the innovative simulation tool and were willing to access the tool again to prepare for future examinations."
