        "Physical inactivity is prevalent and linked with a variety of unfavorable clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients. To increase physical activity (PA) and improve quality of life in this population, intradialytic and out-of-clinic exercise interventions have been implemented in many studies. However, there is still a lack of consensus in the literature on which type of exercise intervention is more feasible and effective.",
        "This review provides a brief overview of intradialytic and out-of-clinic exercise protocols utilized in previous studies. We also examine data related to the feasibility of each approach, and their efficacy for improving cardiovascular health, muscle mass, strength, and physical function. Key Messages: The benefits from most intradialytic and out-of-center exercise training interventions published to date have been modest or inconsistent. Furthermore, neither appears to provide a significant advantage over the other in terms of benefits for cardiovascular health, muscle mass, strength, and physical function. A significant concern is that most intradialytic and out-of-center exercise interventions are mandated exercise prescriptions that include either endurance or resistance training exercises, performed at low-moderate intensities, for a total of 60-135 min of exercise/week. This volume, intensity, and variety of exercise are far less than what is recommended in most PA guidelines. This type of structured activity is also boring for most patients. To enhance the effectiveness of exercise interventions, we suggest using the intradialytic period to provide patients guidance on how they can best incorporate more activity into their lives, based on their individual needs and barriers."
