        "Accumulating scientific evidence indicates that regular physical activity confers significant health benefits. Besides its preventive interest, its promotion is an effective approach of several health problems, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Its clinical prescription is based on two complementary approaches aimed to decrease sedentary behaviours and/or to promote an active lifestyle with long-term objectives. Physicians can play a key role in motivating patients by advising them regarding their physical limitations, their goals, their concerns, and the barriers to exercise. Assessment of the patient's attitudes and motivation towards physical activity is a key element for the success. Objectives, clearly defined, should be evaluated and adapted on a regular basis, with the patient and taking into account the familial and social environment."
