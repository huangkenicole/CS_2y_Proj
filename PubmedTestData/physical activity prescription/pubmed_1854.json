        "Examinations of the effect of resistance training (RT) on muscle strength have attempted to determine differences between prescriptions, mostly examining individual training variables. The broad interaction of variables does not appear to be completely considered, nor has a dose-response function been determined. This registered (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EH94V) systematic review with meta-analysis aims to determine if the interaction of individual training variables to derive RT dose, dosing, and dosage can influence muscle strength and determine if an optimal prescription range exists for developing muscle strength. To derive RT dose, the following calculation will be implemented: number of sets \u00d7 number of repetitions \u00d7 number of exercises \u00d7 exercise intensity, while RT dosing factors in frequency and RT dosage considers program duration. A keyword search strategy utilising interchangeable terms for population (adult), intervention (resistance training), and outcomes (strength) will be conducted across three databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus). Novel to the field of exercise prescription, an analytical approach to determine the dose-response function for continuous outcomes will be used. The pooled standardised mean differences for muscle strength will be estimated using DerSimonian and Laird random effects method. Linear and non-linear dose-response relationships will be estimated by fitting fixed effects and random effects models using the one-stage approach to evaluate if there is a relationship between exercise dose, dosing and dosage and the effect on muscle strength. Maximised log-likelihood and the Akaike Information Criteria will be used to compare alternative best fitting models. Meta regressions will investigate between-study variances and a funnel plot and Egger's test will assess publication bias. The results from this study will identify if an optimal prescription range for dose, dosing and dosage exists to develop muscle strength."
