      "AbstractText": [
        "Eccentric cycling (ECC) has attracted attention as a method to improve muscle strength and aerobic fitness in populations unable to tolerate conventional methods. However, agreement on exercise prescription targets have been problematic. The current report is an initial exploration of a potentially useful tool, a nonlinear heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) index based on the short-term scaling exponent alpha1 of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA a1), which has been previously shown to correspond to exercise intensity. Eleven male volunteers performed 45 min of concentric (CON) cycling and ECC separated by 1 month. Work rates were matched for HR (~50% of the maximal HR) during the first 5 min and remained stable thereafter. HRV, HR, oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), and cycling power were monitored and evaluated at elapsed times of 10 (T10) and 45 (T45) minutes duration. HR significantly increased between ECC T10 and ECC T45 (<i>p</i> = 0.003, d = 1.485), while DFA a1 significantly decreased (<i>p</i> = 0.004, d = 1.087). During CON, HR significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.001 d = 1.570) without significant DFA a1 change (<i>p</i> = 0.48, d = 0.22). Significantly higher HR was observed at T45 in ECC than in CON (<i>p</i> = 0.047, d = 1.059). A session of unaccustomed ECC lead to decreased values of DFA a1 at T45 in comparison to that seen with CON at similar VO<sub>2</sub>. ECC lead to altered autonomic nervous system balance as reflected by the loss of correlation properties compared to CON."
