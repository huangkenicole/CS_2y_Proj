        "To determine if a written exercise prescription increases physical activity when added to verbal advice.",
        "Forty-nine community-dwelling older adults supplied their geriatricians with baseline data on their exercise levels using a questionnaire. Participants were randomly placed in a verbal advice only group or a verbal advice plus written prescription, \"green\" prescription, group. Outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks.",
        "Both groups showed a significant increase in time spent in physical activity. However, no significant differences between groups due to the effects of the different advice modalities were found.",
        "Geriatricians can effectively promote physical activity among sedentary older adults through goal-oriented physical activity advice."
