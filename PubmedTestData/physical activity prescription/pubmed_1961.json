        "We aimed to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and affective response, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and physiological responses during self-paced exercise. Sixty-six women were divided into three groups accordingly with the BMI: obese (n\u202f=\u202f22: 33.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.5\u202fyr; 34.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.1\u202fkg\u2219m<sup>-2</sup>), overweight (n\u202f=\u202f22: 34.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.6\u202fyr; 26.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3\u202fkg\u2219m<sup>-2</sup>), and normal-weight (n\u202f=\u202f22: 30.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.3\u202fyr; 22.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202fkg\u2219m<sup>-2</sup>). They underwent a graded exercise test and a 20-min self-paced walking session on a treadmill. Affective responses, RPE, heart rate (HR), and oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 5\u202fmin. The women with obesity experienced the lowest affective rates (p\u202f<\u202f.001), despite similar RPE, HR, and VO<sub>2</sub> to the other normal weight and overweight groups. In addition, a multiple regression model indicated that BMI was a significant predictor of affective responses (p\u202f<\u202f.001). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that obesity is associated with poorer affective responses to exercise even at self-paced intensity, with the same physiological responses and perceived exertion. Therefore, techniques that aim directly to increase pleasure and/or reduce attentional focus and perception of effort in this population are required, such as affect-regulated prescription, shorter bouts of self-paced exercise throughout the day, distraction away from internal cues (e.g. music, group exercise), etc."
