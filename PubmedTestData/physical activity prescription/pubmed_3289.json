        "There is a growing interest in mobile technology for obesity management. Despite the known effectiveness of workplace-based weight loss programs, there are few studies on mobile phone-delivered interventions.",
        "This study aimed to develop and verify an integrated and personalized mobile technology-based weight control program, named Health-On, optimized for workplaces.",
        "A weight reduction algorithm was developed for calorie prescription, continuous monitoring, periodic feedback and reevaluation, goal resetting, and offline intervention with behavior-changing strategies. A total of 30 obese volunteers (body mass index \u226525 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in the 12-week Health-On pilot program. The primary outcome was weight reduction, and secondary outcomes were improved anthropometric measures, metabolic profiles, and fat computed tomography measures, all assessed pre- and postintervention.",
        "Health-On incorporated proprietary algorithms and several strategies intended to maximize adherence, using compatible online and offline interventions. The mean weight of 30 participants decreased by 5.8%, and median weight also decreased from 81.3 kg (interquartile range [IQR] 77.1-87.8) before intervention to 76.6 kg (IQR 70.8-79.5) after the 12-week intervention period (P<.001). The metabolic profiles and fat measures (blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue; P<.05) also improved significantly.",
        "In this single-group evaluation of 30 participants before and after the Health-On program, body weight decreased and metabolic profiles and fat measures improved. Follow-up studies are needed to assess effectiveness and long-term adherence."
