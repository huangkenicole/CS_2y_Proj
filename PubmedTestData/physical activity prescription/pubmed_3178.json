        "The gold standard for resistance training prescription is the one repetition maximum strength test (1RM). However, there are fears that, by making maximum effort, octogenarian may elevate their blood pressure (BP).",
        "Forty subjects (25 women) aged 83.3\u00b13.2 years underwent two days of office BP measurements (V1 and V2). On the 1RM test day, measurements were performed before (BASAL) and after (POST) test. 1RM tests were performed in the Seated Chest Press (SCP), Leg Press (LP) and Seated Back Row (SBR), with BP measurements immediately after (1RM) and one minute after (1RM(1')) each exercise.",
        "Maximum systolic BP (SBP) in the SCP was 137 mmHg in 1RM, with no difference compared to V1 (P=0.29). In LP, maximum SBP was 143 mmHg in 1RM(1'), but BP came down quickly, with SBP in POST equal to V1 (P=0.95). There were differences over time in SBR (P<0.01), but SBP in 1RM and in 1RM(1') was similar to V1 (P=0.20). There was a small difference in diastolic BP over time.",
        "There was a moderate SBP increase in 1RMand 1RM(1'), with emphasis on the LP. In general, BP after 1RM did not differ from the first assessment day."
