        "To investigate the use of a quota-based approach to prescribing a walking program for individuals with fibromyalgia (FM).",
        "Exercise has been found to be beneficial for individuals with FM. What has not been determined is the best way to implement an exercise program that does not increase FM symptoms.",
        "Three women with FM were randomly assigned a baseline period of 5, 6, or 7 weeks, which served as the control phase, followed by an intervention period consisting of an 8-week walking program. The walking program progression was prescribed using a quota-based approach. Weekly outcome measures were the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES), and SF-36v2 (acute). A 6-minute walk test was recorded twice: at the start of the baseline phase (after a trial phase) and at the end of the intervention phase.",
        "Subjects 1 and 3 had a significant decrease in the symptoms associated with FM during the intervention phase (FIQ, P<.05), but no significant increase in self-efficacy (ASES). They increased their walking distances used for exercise by 640 and 480 m, respectively. Subject 2 had no significant improvements in her symptoms of FM. Despite a significant decrease in ASES (P<.05), walking distance used for exercise by subject 2 increased by 2080 m. Six-minute walk test distances increased 76, 32, and 106 m for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively.",
        "Prescribing a walking program using a quota-based exercise prescription resulted in increasing the distance walked for 3 subjects. It also decreased symptoms associated with FM in 2 of the 3 subjects, but did not increase self-efficacy."
