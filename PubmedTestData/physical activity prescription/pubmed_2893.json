        "Elevated dietary fat increases oxidative metabolism and has been linked to increased oxidative stress, while exercise training may augment antioxidant capacity. Most studies examining oxidative stress in skeletal muscle employ extremely high levels of dietary fat and/or intense exercise training that may not adequately model human diet and activity patterns.",
        "The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction between an elevated (40% of calories) monounsaturated fat diet and a moderate-intensity exercise program similar to recommended human exercise prescriptions, on skeletal muscle oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses.",
        "Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 500 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 6/group): Standard Diet-Sedentary (SD-Sed), Standard Diet-Exercise (SD-Ex), Elevated Fat Diet-Sedentary (EFD-Sed), and Elevated Fat Diet-Exercise (EFD-Ex). The SD groups consumed 76% of calories from CHO, 14% from protein, and 10 % from fat, while the EFD groups received a diet of 46% of calories from CHO, 14% from protein, and 40 % from fat (high oleic sunflower oil). The exercise groups were progressively treadmill trained at 20 m/min, 4 days/week increasing from 15 min/day to 35 min/day by the end of 4 wks.",
        "Antioxidant adaptations associated with exercise training or an elevated fat diet individually reduced basal lipid peroxidation levels in the plantaris muscle. However, the combination of exercise plus a monounsaturated fat diet increased lipid peroxidation levels above that with either treatment alone. This suggests an exhaustion of the antioxidant capacity in the plantaris muscle when both exercise and increased dietary fat diet are combined."
