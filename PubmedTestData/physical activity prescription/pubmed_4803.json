        "Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk or severity of infection, but this has been investigated in few large population-based trials. We analyzed data from the D-Health Trial, using prescription of antibiotics as a surrogate for infection.",
        "The D-Health Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 21\u2005315 Australians aged 60-84 years were randomized to 60\u2005000 IU of supplementary vitamin D3 or placebo monthly for 5 years. For this analysis, the primary outcome was the number of antibiotic prescription episodes; secondary outcomes were total number of prescriptions, repeat prescription episodes, and antibiotics for urinary tract infection. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using negative binomial regression, and odds ratios using logistic regression.",
        "Vitamin D supplementation slightly reduced the number of prescription episodes (IRR, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], .95-1.01), total prescriptions (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, .93-1.00), and repeat prescription episodes (IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, .93-1.00). There was stronger evidence of benefit in people predicted to have insufficient vitamin D at baseline (prescription episodes IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, .87-.99).",
        "Vitamin D may reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions, particularly in people with low vitamin D status. This supports the hypothesis that vitamin D has a clinically relevant effect on the immune system.",
