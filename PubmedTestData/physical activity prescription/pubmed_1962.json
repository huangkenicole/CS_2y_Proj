        "The 'Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages' (TEXT ME) study was a 6-month, single-centre randomised clinical trial (RCT) that found a text message support program improved levels of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The current analyses examined whether receipt of text messages influenced participants' engagement with conventional healthcare resources. The TEXT ME study database (N=710) was linked with routinely collected health department databases. Number of doctor consultations, investigations and cardiac medication prescriptions in the two study groups were compared. The most frequently accessed health service was consultations with a General Practitioner (mean 7.1, s.d. 5.4). The numbers of medical consultations, biochemical tests or cardiac-specific investigations were similar between the study groups. There was at least one prescription registered for statin, ACEI/ARBs and \u03b2-blockers in 79, 66 and 50% of patients respectively, with similar refill rates in both the study groups. The study identified TEXT ME text messaging program did not increase use of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) captured healthcare services. The observed benefits of TEXT ME reflect direct effects of intervention independent of conventional healthcare resource engagement."
