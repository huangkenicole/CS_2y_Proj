        "Following a transtibial amputation (TTA), physical activity has known benefits for health and quality of life. Adults post-TTA, however, demonstrate reduced physical activity, predisposing them to adverse health outcomes. Identifying adults at the risk of sedentarism post-TTA via commonly used, objective clinical measures may enhance clinical decisions, including prosthesis prescription. The study's purpose was to determine whether residual and sound limb hip strength distinguishes between sedentary and nonsedentary adults post-TTA. A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional dataset (n\u2009=\u200944) was conducted. Participant residual and sound limb hip flexion, extension, abduction and adduction strength were assessed via handheld dynamometry. Physical activity was monitored for 7 days and participants were classified as sedentary (<5000 steps/day; n\u2009=\u200913) or nonsedentary (\u22655000 steps/day; n\u2009=\u200931). Receiver operating curves revealed that residual and sound limb hip extension, abduction and adduction strength distinguished between sedentary and nonsedentary adults post-TTA (P\u2009<\u20090.050). Preliminary cut-points for hip strength measures to classify adults at the risk of sedentarism were determined. A hip strength composite score (0-6) estimates a 2.2\u00d7 increased odds of being sedentary with each additional hip strength deficit. Post-TTA, residual and sound limb hip strength can help identify adults at risk of sedentarism to aid clinical decision making, including prosthesis prescription."
