        "Only in the USA, 315 billion dollars are spent annually on the medical cost of obesity in adult patients. Till now, bariatric surgery is the most effective method for treating obesity and can play an essential role in reducing the direct and indirect costs of obesity treatment. Nonetheless, there are few comprehensive guidelines which include nutrition, physical activity, and supplements, before and after surgery. The purpose of the present narrative review is to provide an updated and comprehensive practical guideline to help multidisciplinary teams. The core keywords include nutrition, diet, physical activity, exercise, supplements, macronutrients, micronutrients, weight reduction, bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, Sleeve Gastrostomy, Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding, and Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch which were searched in databases including PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and some other sources such as Google Scholar. We answered questions in five important areas: (a) nutritional strategies before bariatric surgery, (b) nutrition after bariatric surgery, (c) physical activity before and after bariatric surgery, (d) weight regain after bariatric surgery, and (e) micronutrient assessments and recommendations before and after bariatric surgery. Some new items were added in this updated guideline including \"weight regain\" and \"pregnancy after bariatric surgery.\" Other fields were updated based on new evidence and guidelines."
