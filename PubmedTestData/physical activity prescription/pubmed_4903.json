        "Lifestyle and socioeconomic position may confound the link between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cardiovascular events, if associated with NSAID use. We examined this association.",
        "We conducted a cohort study of all adult first-time responders to the Danish National Health Surveys of 2010, 2013, or 2017 without an NSAID prescription within 3 months before survey completion (n\u00a0=\u00a0407\u2009395). Study exposures were weight, smoking status, alcohol consumption, binge drinking frequency, physical activity level, marital status, highest achieved level of education, income, and employment status. We used a Cox model to compute hazard ratios of time to first redemption of an NSAID prescription and a cumulative odds model to compute odds ratios (ORs) of redeeming one additional NSAID prescription in the year after survey completion.",
        "Total follow-up time was 1\u2009931\u2009902\u2009years. The odds of redeeming one additional NSAID prescription in the year after survey completion varied within all categories of lifestyle and socioeconomic position. The largest ORs were observed within categories of weight (1.70, 95% CI: 1.65-1.74 for obesity vs. normal weight), smoking status (1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.27 for current vs. never use), and education (1.44, 95% CI: 1.39-1.49 for primary or other vs. university or higher education). The Cox model showed consistent results.",
        "Markers of unhealthy lifestyle and low socioeconomic position were associated with initiation and prolonged NSAID use. Consideration of lifestyle and socioeconomic markers as potential confounders in NSAID studies is therefore recommended."
