        "This study aimed to determine heart rate accuracy measured by wearable devices during resistance exercises at various intensities. Twenty-nine participants (16 female) aged 19-37\u00a0years participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed five resistance exercises; Barbell Back Squat, Barbell Deadlift, Dumbbell Curl to Overhead Press, Seated Cable Row, and Burpees. During the exercises, heart rate was concurrently measured using the Polar H10, the Apple Watch Series 6 and the Whoop 3.0. The Apple Watch had high agreement with the Polar H10 during Barbell Back Squats, Barbell Deadlift, and Seated Cable Rows (rho > 0.832) and moderate to low agreement during Dumbbell Curl to Overhead Press and Burpees (rho > 0.364). The Whoop Band 3.0 had high agreement with the Polar H10 during Barbell Back Squats (r\u00a0>\u00a00.697), moderate agreement during Barbell Deadlift and Dumbbell Curl to Overhead Press (rho > 0.564) and low agreement during Seated Cable Rows and Burpees (rho > 0.383). The results varied across exercises and intensities and indicated the most favourable outcomes for the Apple Watch. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Apple Watch Series 6 is suitable for measuring heart rate during exercise prescription or monitoring resistance exercise performance."
