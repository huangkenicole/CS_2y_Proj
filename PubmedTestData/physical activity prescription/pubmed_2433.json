        "Saari, A, Dicks, ND, Hartman, ME, and Pettitt, RW. Validation of the 3-minute all-out exercise test for shuttle running prescription. J Strength Cond Res 33(6): 1679-1685, 2019-A 3-minute all-out exercise test (3 MT) for running has been developed to determine critical speed (CS) and finite capacity for running speeds > CS (D') which allow for the prediction of time limits (TLIMs) associated with running different distances. Most team sports require shuttle running; however, the 3 MT was validated for uninterrupted, track running and not shuttle running. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of shuttle running 3 MT to determine CS and D'. A total of 12 subjects were tested using a baseline 3 MT along with 3 separate distance time trials of all-out shuttle running to determine true CS and D'. The 3 MT (2.94 \u00b1 0.39 m\u00b7s) and the true CS (3.00 \u00b1 0.36 m\u00b7s) for shuttle running did not differ (p = 0.71) and had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 7.7%. Conversely, D' from the 3 MT exceeded true D' by 42 m (p = 0.04, CV = 36%). The TLIMs estimated for the 3 different distances were within \u223c2-6% (p = 0.60). Based on these outcomes, the shuttle run 3 MT may offer a suitable method for prescribing shuttle running interval training."
