        "Participation in physical activity for people with Multiple sclerosis (MS) is important but can be difficult to sustain long-term. Facilitators for long-term adherence include choice over activity and control over level of engagement, coupled with support, advice and encouragement from a physiotherapist. This is the basis of Blue Prescription, a novel physiotherapy approach aimed at optimising long-term adherence with physical activity. We evaluated the feasibility and short-term benefits of Blue Prescription in people with MS.",
        "Twenty-seven people with MS (mean age: 51\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years, with a range of MS type and disability) were assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention with the MS Impact Scale, MS Self-efficacy Scale, and European Quality of Life Questionnaire. Change in outcomes were analysed with Wilcoxon signed ranks tests.",
        "All participants, irrespective of level of disability, were able to choose a physical activity and to engage in it. The physical component MS Impact Scale score significantly improved by a median change of 6.5 (95% CI = -10.5 to -2.0; p = 0.007; effect size = 0.38). There were no other significant changes in outcomes.",
        "Blue Prescription appears feasible and potentially beneficial, particularly in reducing the negative impacts of MS upon individuals, and thus warrants further evaluation."
