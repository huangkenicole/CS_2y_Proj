        "The study was undertaken to investigate the relationships between linear speed, change of direction, and explosive power in the lower limbs of young soccer players. We aimed to determine the variables associated with effective change-of-direction speeds (time) based on the 30-m ZigZag (cutting maneuver) under 60\u00b0 (CODS<sup>1</sup>), and 30 m sprint divided into forward-backward-forward movement (CODS<sup>2</sup>). Sixty young soccer players (age: 17.4 \u00b1 0.7 years, height: 1.76 \u00b1 0.06 m, weight: 68.1 \u00b1 8.9 kg) from soccer sport clubs were included. The participants performed 30-m change-of-direction sprints and 30-m backward and forward sprints. For the maximum speed evaluation, a straight-line 30-m sprint test was performed. Counter-movement jumps and standing broad jumps were used to assess jumping ability. Pearson's linear correlation and a multiple stepwise linear regression model were used to adjust for variations related to the influence of functional speed and explosive power variables, which were analyzed based on the CODS<sup>1</sup> and CODS<sup>2</sup> data. Our results showed that 30-m CODS<sup>2</sup> and standing broad jumps were associated with CODS<sup>1</sup>. The variation for the 30-m change-of-direction maneuvers under 60\u00b0 could be explained by the results of 30-m forward-backward-forward change-of-direction. The standing broad jump explained 10% variation for the performances in change-of-direction sprint decrements and 9% variation for the 5-m change-of-direction with the best times, whereas straight-line sprinting was related to forward-backward-forward change-of-direction. The 10-m sprint explained 50% variation of the performances in the first 10-m forward running in the CODS<sup>2</sup> and 12% variation for 10-m backward-forward change-of-direction. The 30-m sprint explained 36% variation for 30-m forward-backward-forward change-of-direction. The 30-m sprint and overall body mass also explained 58% variation for 10-m forward-backward change-of-direction. For coaching purposes, we report that forward-backward-forward and cutting maneuver change-of-direction movements are independent and highly useful skills. This information can help to provide better training prescriptions."
