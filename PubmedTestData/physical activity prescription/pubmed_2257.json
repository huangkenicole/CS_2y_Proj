        "Health professionals face two complicated but contradictory epidemics: obesity and osteoporosis (OP). While obesity is obvious, OP progresses silently affecting one in two UK women. Both South Asian and Caucasian women are at OP risk. This study compared experiences of osteoporotic Caucasian and South Asian women in a purposive sample of 21 volunteers from south east England, aged 43 to 82 years. The women had been diagnosed for eight months to 40 years. Long disease duration was marked by complacent OP dialogue, although OP was objectionable and marked a loss of quality of life. Inductive content analysis of transcripts showed that 'uncertainty'--about one another and about what constituted helpful self-care--affected both GPs and patients. Instead, support groups and the media supported learning about OP care. Beyond providing drug prescriptions, women reported desiring, but rarely feeling, that GPs fully supported their preferences for self-care. Self-care often included specialist exercise classes. Some younger women led their GPs to better understand the range of self-care options. GPs were seen as being unsure about how and when to discuss physical activity (PA). In conclusion, women with OP in this sample are sensitive to their GP's hesitance about offering detailed PA recommendations. Regardless of ethnicity, younger women undertook PA based on personal initiative. Positive PA experiences stimulated an interest in discussing PA with GPs, and these dialogues broke the silence surrounding OP care. By providing important information regarding the OP patient experience, the findings highlight the unmet desire of OP sufferers for better and closer attention from GPs."
