        "Physical activity has declined further during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Physicians are at the front lines of proactively educating and promoting physical activity to patients; however, physicians do not feel confident and face numerous barriers in prescribing exercise to patients. Exercise referral schemes, comprising collaborations with qualified exercise professionals, represent a fruitful option for supporting physicians hoping to promote physical activity to more patients. Herein, we provide practical suggestions for establishing and creating a successful referral scheme. Ultimately, exercise referral schemes offer an alternative to help physician burnout and mitigate patient physical inactivity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."
