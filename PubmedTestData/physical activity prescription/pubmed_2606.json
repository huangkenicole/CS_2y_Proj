        "Backward walking has gained popularity as an adjunct to treatment for patients undergoing rehabilitation for patellofemoral pain syndrome and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Researchers have suggested that backward walking decreases the compressive forces at the patellofemoral joint while also preventing overstretching of the anterior cruciate ligament. Prior to this study, precise prescription of backward walking speeds for women was not possible. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between heart rate, oxygen consumption, and backward walking speeds. Twenty-five healthy, adult female volunteers participated in this study. Subjects were tested at speeds of 0.96, 1.20, 1.43, 1.67, and 1.91 m/sec. Subjects also performed a graded exercise stress test. Analysis revealed curvilinear relationships between oxygen consumption and speed as well as between heart rate and speed. With these results, clinicians may now prescribe specific speeds of backward walking for women to elicit a desired cardiopulmonary response."
