        "We present the results from the PREVESE Study, conducted in two phases: the first to identify the secondary prevention measurements recommended in Spain in patients who were discharged after a myocardial infarction; the second, 6 months later, to determine their evolution.",
        "Data was collected from 1,242 patients in 39 hospitals. An analysis was made of the patients background, risk factors, working status, diagnostic procedures used during hospitalization, laboratory findings and drug therapy prescribed at discharge. At the second control, the risk factors status, diagnostic or assessment tests performed during the 6-month period, working status, mortality and cardiac events were revised.",
        "The previous history and risk factors studied showed a high risk profile among patients after myocardial infarction. Among the drug therapies prescribed at discharge the small percentage (6.7%) of lipid lowering prescriptions should be highlighted. An improvement in the risk factor profile was found at the six month checkup with a substantial reduction in the number of smokers, a very low number of hypertensives and an improvement in physical activity. There was no improvement in total-cholesterol levels.",
        "The implementation of preventive measures is not similar in all risk factors. An improvement is reached in prevention of smoking habit and hypertension, but not in the treatment of abnormal levels of hyperlipidemia."
