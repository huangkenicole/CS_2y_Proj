        "Alternatives to center-based pulmonary rehabilitation are needed to improve patient access to this important therapy. A critical challenge to overcome is how to maximize safety of unsupervised exercise for at-risk patients. We investigated if a novel remote monitoring-enabled mobile health (mHealth) program is safe, feasible, and effective for patients who experience exercise-induced hemoglobin desaturation.",
        "An interstitial lung disease (ILD) commonly associated with pronounced exercise desaturation was investigated - the rare, female-predominant ILD lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Over a 12-week program, hemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was continuously recorded during all home exercise sessions. Intervention effects were assessed with 6-min walk test (6MWT), maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), lower extremity computerized dynamometry, pulmonary function tests, and health-related quality of life (QoL) surveys. Safety was assessed by blood biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac wall stress, and incidence of adverse events.",
        "Fifteen LAM patients enrolled and 14 completed the intervention, with high adherence to aerobic (87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015%) and strength (87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%) training components. An innovative characterization of exercise training SpO<sub>2</sub> revealed that while mild-to-moderate desaturation was common during home workouts, participants were able to self-adjust exercise intensity and supplemental oxygen levels to maintain recommended exercise parameters. Significant improvements included 6MWT distance (+36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034\u00a0m, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), CPET time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), muscular endurance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), QoL (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009 to 0.03), and fatigue (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 to 0.03). Patient acceptability and satisfaction indicators were high, blood biomarkers remained stable (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and no study-related adverse events occurred.",
