        "To compare the metabolic, cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses to three isoenergetic high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) protocols of different bout duration and an isoenergetic continuous exercise protocol.",
        "Eleven healthy males (age, 28 \u00b1 6 yr) performed four 20-min cycling trials of equal mean power output 1 wk apart. Participants cycled either continuously (CON) or intermittently with 10 s (HIIE10), 30 s (HIIE30), or 60 s (HIIE60) bouts at intensities corresponding to 49% (CON) or 100% of power at peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2peak). Recovery intervals during the HIIE trials were 15, 45, and 90 s, respectively.",
        "Average V\u0307O2 was similar in the HIIE trials (2.29 \u00b1 0.42, 2.20 \u00b1 0.43, and 2.12 \u00b1 0.45 L\u00b7min-1, for HIIE10, HIIE30, and HIIE60, respectively), whereas in CON (2.02 \u00b1 0.38 L\u00b7min-1), it was lower than HIIE10 (P = 0.002) and HIIE30 (P = 0.043). Average pulmonary ventilation (VE) was higher in HIIE60 compared with HIIE10, HIIE30, and CON (75.8 \u00b1 21.8 L\u00b7min-1 vs 64.1 \u00b1 14.5 L\u00b7min-1, 64.1 \u00b1 16.2 L\u00b7min-1, and 54.0 \u00b1 12.5 L\u00b7min-1, respectively, P < 0.001). The peak values and oscillations of V\u0307O2 and VE in HIIE60 were higher compared with all other trials (P < 0.001). Blood lactate concentration was higher in HIIE60 compared with HIIE10, HIIE30, and CON from the fifth minute onward, reaching 12.5 \u00b1 3.5, 7.2 \u00b1 2.1, 7.9 \u00b1 2.9, and 4.9 \u00b1 1.6 mmol\u00b7L-1, respectively, at the end of exercise (P < 0.001). RPE was higher and affective responses were lower in HIIE60 compared with all other trials toward the end of exercise (P < 0.001).",
        "These findings highlight the importance of bout duration in HIIE, since shorter bouts resulted in attenuated metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses, lower RPE and feelings of displeasure compared with a longer bout, despite equal total work, duration, and work-to-recovery ratio. These results may have implications for the prescription of HIIE in various populations."
