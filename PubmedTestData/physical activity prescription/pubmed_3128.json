        "Research in vascular exercise has demonstrated remarkable improvement in symptoms of claudication without more expensive and invasive interventions. During the past 5 years, 86 patients have graduated from The Brown University Supervised Vascular Exercise Program. Patients demonstrate a threefold improvement in maximum walking distance after 12 weeks of training. Information available on 22 patients at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups show walking distance is improved or maintained with continued training. Components of the program are presented in 3 phases. Phase 1 addresses the comprehensive nursing assessment, cardiac screening, and progressive treadmill testing. Phase II includes specific method of exercise prescription and educational needs of peripheral vascular disease patients. Phase III discusses the importance of maintenance and motivating patients to continue."
