        "Despite the theoretic risks to both mother and fetus listed in this article, exercise in pregnancy conducted in moderation appears to be safe in most cases. The current published literature includes the following consistent findings: 1. Women who exercised before pregnancy and continued to do so during pregnancy tended to weigh less, gain less weight, and deliver smaller babies than controls. 2. All women, regardless of initial level of physical activity, decrease their activity as pregnancy progresses. 3. No information is available to assess whether active women have better pregnancy outcome than their sedentary counterparts. No information is available on sedentary women. 4. Physically active women appear to tolerate labor pain better. 5. Exercise can be used as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach for gestational diabetes. Pregnancy should not be a state of confinement, and cardiovascular and muscular fitness can be reasonably maintained. Restriction of physical activity should be dictated by obstetric and medical indications only. Health care providers should inform pregnant women of potential risks and individualized exercise prescription as indicated and necessary."
