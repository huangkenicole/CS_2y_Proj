        "The benefits of physical activity (PA) in managing chronic diseases are largely demonstrated. To encourage a sustainable PA practice for inactive patients with chronic diseases, France has recently implemented PA resumption programs, in which patients can participate with a medical prescription but which are time-limited. In the literature, the effectiveness of those exercise referral schemes to foster sustainable PA practice is still mixed. The present study aims at capitalizing the experience of eight resumption programs to understand what makes the programs work, adherence mechanisms and the post-program referral scheme. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews informed those intervention mechanisms analysed using thematic analysis. This study provides insights into expertize in patient management among these programs, currently due to key findings as the employment of adapted PA teachers, their training and the use of mechanisms for program adherence (practice conditions, emphasize progress and feelings generated by exercise, the relational and social aspect of practice). Other key findings are a lack of clarity in program objectives which is an area of improvement, and a broad diversity of referral (transmitting contact details, contacting the club, intervention of a third-party association or physical presence) that need further exploration."
