        "Redman, KJ, Connick, MJ, Beckman, EM, and Kelly, VG. Monitoring prescribed and actual resistance training loads in professional rugby league. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1604-1610, 2021-Coaches devote a considerable amount of time and effort prescribing and selecting exercises to elicit training adaptations. Adherence to the prescribed resistance training load may vary for a number of reasons. The aim of this study was to quantify the difference between prescribed and actual resistance training loads in a team of professional rugby league players. Training loads were quantified using volume load and training intensity throughout a season. The competition was categorized into preseason, early competition, mid-competition, and late competition. Twenty-seven players participated in this study. Four exercises were monitored: back squat, bench press, bench pull, and clean pull. A Friedman's test was used to assess differences between prescribed and actual training loads throughout different phases of the season, for different exercises, and during different weeks in a training block. There were significantly greater differences in prescribed and actual volume loads during the mid-competition in comparison to all other phases of the season (p < 0.01). Although players adherence to prescribed training intensity was significantly greater during the preseason compared with the remainder of the season (p < 0.05), they completed significantly less prescribed training load during week 1 in comparison to week 4 within a training block (p < 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that regular monitoring of completed resistance training loads may be of greater importance to strength and conditioning coaches to assist in examining potential progress and fatigue or allow for more accurate prescription of load to enhance adaptation throughout a season."
