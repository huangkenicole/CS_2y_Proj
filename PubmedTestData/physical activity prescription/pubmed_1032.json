        "Congenital heart disease (ConHD) affects\u00a0approximately 1% of all live births. People with ConHD are living longer due to improved medical intervention and are at risk of developing non-communicable diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is reduced in people with ConHD, who deteriorate\u00a0faster compared to healthy people. CRF is known to be prognostic of future mortality and morbidity: it\u00a0is\u00a0therefore\u00a0important to assess the evidence base on physical activity interventions in this population to inform decision making.",
        "To assess the effectiveness and safety of all types of physical activity interventions versus\u00a0standard care\u00a0in individuals with congenital heart disease.",
        "We undertook a\u00a0systematic\u00a0search on\u00a023\u00a0September 2019 of the following databases: CENTRAL,\u00a0MEDLINE, Embase,\u00a0CINAHL, AMED, BIOSIS Citation Index,\u00a0Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS and\u00a0DARE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and we\u00a0reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.",
        "We included\u00a0randomised controlled trials\u00a0(RCT) that compared any type of physical activity intervention against a 'no physical activity' (usual care) control. We included all individuals\u00a0with a diagnosis of\u00a0congenital heart disease, regardless of age or previous medical interventions.\u00a0 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (CAW and CW)\u00a0independently screened all the identified references for inclusion. We retrieved and read all full papers; and we contacted study authors if we needed any further information. The same two independent reviewers who\u00a0extracted the data then\u00a0processed the included papers, assessed their risk of bias using RoB 2\u00a0and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\u00a0The primary outcomes were: maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by\u00a0peak oxygen consumption; health-related quality of life (HRQoL) determined by a validated questionnaire; and device-worn 'objective' measures of physical activity.",
        "We included 15\u00a0RCTs\u00a0with 924\u00a0participants\u00a0in the review. The median intervention length/follow-up length was 12 weeks (12 to 26 interquartile range (IQR)).\u00a0There were five RCTs of children and adolescents (n = 500) and 10 adult RCTs (n = 424). We identified three types of intervention: physical activity promotion; exercise training; and inspiratory muscle training. We assessed the risk of bias of results for CRF as either being of some concern (n = 12) or at\u00a0a high risk of bias (n\u00a0=\u00a02), due to a\u00a0failure to blind\u00a0intervention staff. One study did not report this outcome. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across measured outcomes. When we pooled all types of interventions (physical activity promotion, exercise training and inspiratory muscle training), compared to a 'no\u00a0exercise' control\u00a0CRF may slightly increase, with a\u00a0mean difference (MD) of 1.89 mL/kg<sup>-1</sup>/min<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI -0.22 to\u00a03.99; n = 732; moderate-certainty evidence).\u00a0The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity and exercise interventions on HRQoL. There was a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.76\u00a0(95% CI -0.13 to 1.65;\u00a0n = 163; very low certainty evidence) in HRQoL. However, we could pool only three\u00a0studies in a meta-analysis, due to different ways of reporting. Only one study out of eight showed a positive effect on HRQoL. There may be a small improvement in mean daily physical activity (PA) (SMD 0.38,\u00a095% CI -0.15 to\u00a00.92; n = 328; low-certainty evidence), which equates to\u00a0approximately an additional 10 minutes of physical activity daily (95% CI -2.50 to\u00a022.20). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely result in an increase in submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness (MD 2.05,\u00a095% CI 0.05 to 4.05; n = 179; moderate-certainty evidence). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely increase muscular strength (MD 17.13, 95% CI 3.45 to 30.81; n = 18; moderate-certainty evidence).\u00a0Eleven studies (n = 501) reported on the outcome of adverse events (73% of total studies). Of the 11 studies, six\u00a0studies reported zero\u00a0adverse events. Five\u00a0studies reported a total of 11 adverse events; 36% of adverse events were cardiac related\u00a0(n\u00a0= 4); there were, however, no serious adverse events\u00a0related to the interventions or reported\u00a0fatalities (moderate-certainty evidence).\u00a0No studies reported hospital admissions.",
        "This review summarises the latest evidence on CRF, HRQoL and PA. Although there were only small improvements in CRF and PA, and small to no\u00a0improvements in HRQoL, there were no reported serious\u00a0adverse events related to the interventions. Although these data are promising, there is currently\u00a0insufficient evidence to definitively determine the impact of physical activity\u00a0interventions in ConHD. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are therefore needed, utilising\u00a0a longer duration of follow-up."
