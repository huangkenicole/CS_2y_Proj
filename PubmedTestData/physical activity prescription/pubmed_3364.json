        "To compare different physiological responses between treadmill and cycle ergometer in stroke patients in regard to community ambulation, and to determine strong predictors of equipment-dependent VO<sub>2peak</sub> and its related factors among physical fitness parameters and finally to establish the significance of cycle ergometer as a measure of VO<sub>2peak</sub> in the disabled according to gait function.",
        "Sixty-three stroke survivors were enrolled in this study and were grouped according to the gait speed (32 non-community ambulators <0.8 m/s:31 community ambulators \u22650.8 m/s). All participants performed exercise stress test (EST) with treadmill and cycle ergometer and rehabilitation function tests.",
        "Community ambulators achieved higher VO<sub>2peak</sub> by treadmill, but non-community ambulators showed similar VO<sub>2peak</sub> between treadmill and cycle ergometer due to gait problems. The gait speed and endurance were strong predictors of difference of peak aerobic capacity between treadmill and cycle ergometer (multiple regression analysis, adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=0.458).",
        "Cycle ergometer might be more appropriate for non-community ambulatory stroke patients to assess the peak aerobic capacity. Gait speed and gait distance could affect equipment-dependent cardiopulmonary performance significantly in the disabled. Therefore, the careful consideration of comprehensive and objective physical function including gait endurance, and speed and prescription of appropriate exercise intensity and equipment depending on the severity should be needed to improve the cardiopulmonary fitness and physical function adequately in stroke rehabilitation."
