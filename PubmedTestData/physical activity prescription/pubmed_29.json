        "An increase in physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in many diseases. An estimated 600\u2009000 Canadians receive their primary health care from emergency departments (ED). This study aims to examine physical activity prescription by emergency medicine physicians (EPs) to determine factors that influence decisions to prescribe physical activity. A survey was distributed to EPs via email using the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) survey distribution protocol. Responses from 20% (n = 332) of emergency physician/residents in Canada were analyzed. Of the EPs, 62.7% often/always counsel patients about preventative medicine (smoking, diet, and alcohol). Only 12.7% (42) often/always prescribe physical activity. The CCFP-trained physicians (College of Family Physicians Canada) were significantly more likely to feel comfortable than CCFP-EM-trained physicians (Family Physicians with Enhanced Skills in Emergency Medicine) prescribing physical activity (p = 0.0001). Both were significantly more likely than the FRCPC-trained EPs (Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada). Of the EPs, 73.4% (244) believe the ED environment does not allow adequate time for physical activity prescription. Family medicine-trained EPs are more likely to prescribe physical activity; the training they receive may better educate them compared with FRCPC-trained emergency medicine. Further education is required to standardize an approach to ED physical activity prescription."
