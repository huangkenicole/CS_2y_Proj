        "This article presents a systematic review (2009-2018) of the literature in social sciences and public health concerning exercise on prescription. The review is oriented towards studies about the beneficiaries of these prescriptions and seeks to question the use of socio-ecological indicators.",
        "The interrogation of bibliographic databases made it possible to retain 28\u00a0papers taking into account the following inclusion criteria: (1)\u00a0publication in a peer-reviewed journal; (2)\u00a0prescription of physical activity by a health professional; (3)\u00a0adult beneficiaries; (4)\u00a0prescription for a supervised physical activity program; (5) physical activity program of at least one month; (6)\u00a0socio-demographic or psychosocial indicators complementary to age and sex only.",
        "The prescription of physical activity refers to various interventions in terms of target audiences, modalities of supervision, duration of care or type of monitoring at the end of the program. The studies are mainly related to the measurement of the physical activity level during and/or after the intervention. They mobilize essentially individual indicators and analyze few other determinants from a socio-ecological perspective.",
        "Taking into account the different types and levels of determinants, in a multidimensional approach, would make it possible to identify the social, relational and territorial factors, as well as their respective weight and their links, to refine the health promotion actions and to favor levers of access to less sedentary lifestyles and lasting changes in everyday practices."
