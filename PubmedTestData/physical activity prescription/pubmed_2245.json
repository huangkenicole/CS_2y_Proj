        "Olympic flat water kayaking races take place over a distance of 500 and 1,000 m. This study was designed to determine the aerobic and anaerobic contributions to 500- and 1,000-m races during flat water paddling in open water, using the accumulated oxygen deficit (AOD) method. Seven internationally ranked athletes, specialized in 500-m races and familiar with 1,000-m races, participated in this study (age: 21.86 \u00b1 1.68 years, body mass: 78.54 \u00b1 3.41 kg, height: 1.84 \u00b1 0.03 m, body fat%: 10.14 \u00b1 0.69%). All the participants performed 3 track-kayaking sessions. During the first session, the maximal oxygen uptake and maximal aerobic speed were determined using a portable gas analyzer and a global positioning system. During the successive testing sessions, paddlers performed in a randomized counterbalanced order a 500- and a 1,000-m race under field conditions (open water track kayaking). The 500-m AOD was significantly higher than the 1,000-m AOD (18.16 \u00b1 4.88 vs. 9.34 \u00b1 1.38 ml\u00b7kg(-1), p < 0.05). The aerobic contribution resulted in being higher during the 1,000 m compared with that in the 500-m condition (86.61 \u00b1 1.86% vs. 78.30 \u00b1 1.85%, respectively, p < 0.05). The results of this study showed that the 500- and 1,000-m races are 2 physiologically different kayaking events with a higher aerobic contribution in the 1,000 m. The training prescription for elite athletes should emphasize aerobic high-intensity training for the 1,000 m and anaerobic short-term training for the 500-m race."
