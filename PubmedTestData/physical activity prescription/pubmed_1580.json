      "AbstractText": [
        "Stroke impacts nearly 14 million people annually. Muscle strength and physical function are often affected by stroke and important determinants of stroke recovery. Resistance exercise training (RT) has been shown to improve muscle strength, but RT prescriptions may be suboptimal for other aspects of stroke recovery. Parameters such as frequency, intensity, type, and duration may influence the effectiveness of RT interventions but have not been systematically evaluated.",
        "1) To determine the effects of RT on stroke recovery, and 2) to examine the influence of RT parameters on intervention effects.",
        "Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of RT will be eligible for this systematic review if they: 1) included only adults with stroke or transient ischemic attack, 2) compared RT to no exercise or usual care, and 3) did not apply a co-intervention.",
        "Eight databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, AMED, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and 2 clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) will be searched from inception. Two independent pairs of authors will compare titles, abstracts, and full-text reports against the eligibility criteria. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus or third author.",
        "The construct of interest is stroke recovery. An advisory group of clinicians, researchers, and partners with lived experience of stroke will be consulted to determine specific outcome measures of interest, and to rank their relative importance. We expect to include measures of physical function, strength, cognition, and quality of life. Random-effects meta-analyses will be used to pool results for each outcome across studies, and RT parameters (frequency, intensity, type, and duration) will be used as covariates in meta-regression analyses.",
        "The results of this review will inform the optimal RT prescription parameters for promoting stroke recovery."
