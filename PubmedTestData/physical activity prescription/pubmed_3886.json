        "Clinical commentary.",
        "Pain and movement are universally relevant phenomena that influence human experiences in readily observable ways. Improved understanding of pain-movement relationships can guide medical and rehabilitative approaches to recovery and decrease risk of dysfunctional long-term consequences of otherwise normal neuromuscular responses. Therefore, the overall intent of this article is to elucidate the relationships between pain and movement as they relate to clinical decision making.",
        "Motor output is highly adaptable, can be influenced by multiple mechanisms at various levels along the nervous system, and may vary between individuals despite similar diagnoses. Therefore, interventions need to be individualized and consider both the types of motor response observed (ie,\u00a0whether the response is protective or maladaptive), and the patient's acute physical activity tolerance when prescribing exercise/movement."
