      "AbstractText": [
        "Music is an invaluable tool to improve affective valence during exercise, with the potential contribution of a mechanism called rhythmic entrainment. However, several methodological limitations impair our current understanding of the effect of music on relevant psychophysiological responses to exercise, including breathing variables. This study presents conceptual, methodological, and operational insight favoring the investigation of the effect of music on breathing during exercise. Three tools were developed for the quantification of the presence, degree, and magnitude of music-locomotor, locomotor-breathing, and music-breathing entrainment. The occurrence of entrainment was assessed during 30 min of moderate cycling exercise performed either when listening to music or not, and was complemented by the recording of relevant psychophysiological and mechanical variables. Respiratory frequency and expiratory time were among the physiological variables that were affected to a greater extent by music during exercise, and a significant (p < 0.05) music-breathing entrainment was found in all 12 participants. These findings suggest the importance of evaluating the effect of music on breathing responses to exercise, with potential implications for exercise prescription and adherence, and for the development of wearable devices simultaneously measuring music, locomotor, and breathing signals."
