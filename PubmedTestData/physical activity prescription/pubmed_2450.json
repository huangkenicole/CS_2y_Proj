        "This study is designed to investigate the physical, psychological and quality of life (QoL) effects of a 16 week supervised and structured intensive aerobic and strength training during the first line chemotherapy of lymphomas.",
        "This pre-post study with two groups enrolled \u226518 years of age lymphoma patients scheduled for the first line chemotherapy. Eligible patients were assigned upon patients' preference either to control group (Group C) involving simple counselling, or intervention group (Group I) involving supervised intensive training. Baseline, interim and final evaluations were performed per protocol. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the effect of intervention.",
        "The mean age of 47 enrolled patients was 44 [standard deviation (SD) \u00b1 17] and 27 (57.4%) of them were male. Patients in Group C (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and Group I (n\u00a0=\u00a028) had similar baseline characteristics. T<sub>max</sub> was significantly higher in Group I (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) without a significant change during the study course (P\u00a0=\u00a0.98). Significant increases were observed in the power of some muscle groups, irrespective of the intervention type. The mean adherence rates were 83.0% (SD \u00b1 22.0) and 54.0% (SD \u00b1 23.0); the discontinuation rates were 10.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and 42.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a012), at interim and final evaluations, respectively.",
        "Both supervised and structured schemes and simple counselling, prevent further muscle wasting and lead to modest improvements in aerobic performance and muscle strength during lymphoma chemotherapy. These results do not translate into a significant improvement in QoL measures. Non-adherence and discontinuation are important issues to be solved."
