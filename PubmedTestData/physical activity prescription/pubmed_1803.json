        "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are recommended standard-of-care by all major cardiovascular medicine professional organizations. Exercise training is the cornerstone for CR, with aerobic training being the primary form of training. The benefits of exercise training are multiple; however, improved cardiorespiratory fitness is of utmost importance. Moderate-intensity continuous training, supplemented with resistance training, has traditionally been the most common form of exercise training in CR. This review discusses the role of aerobic exercise training in CR and the importance of effective and personalized exercise prescription for optimized results. We also focus on the benefits and utility of high-intensity interval training across different clinical populations commonly seen in the CR setting."
