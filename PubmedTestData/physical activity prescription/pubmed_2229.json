        "GlycA is a new composite measure of systemic inflammation and a predictor of many inflammatory diseases. GlycA is the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-derived signal arising from glucosamine residues on acute-phase proteins. This study aimed to evaluate how exercise-based lifestyle interventions modulate GlycA in persons at risk for type 2 diabetes. GlycA, fitness, and body habitus were measured in 169 sedentary adults (45-75 years) with prediabetes randomly assigned to one of four six-month exercise-based lifestyle interventions. Interventions included exercise prescription based on the amount (energy expenditure (kcal/kg weight/week (KKW)) and intensity (%VO<sub>2peak</sub>). The groups were (1) low-amount/moderate-intensity (10KKW/50%) exercise; (2) high-amount/moderate-intensity (16KKW/50%) exercise; (3) high-amount/vigorous-intensity (16KKW/75%) exercise; and (4) a Clinical Lifestyle (combined diet plus low-amount/moderate-intensity exercise) intervention. Six months of exercise training and/or diet-reduced GlycA (mean \u0394: -6.8\u2009\u00b1\u200929.2\u2009<i>\u03bc</i>mol/L; <i>p</i> = 0.006) and increased VO<sub>2peak</sub> (mean \u0394: 1.98\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u2009mL/kg/min; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Further, visceral (mean \u0394: -21.1\u2009\u00b1\u200936.6\u2009cm<sup>2</sup>) and subcutaneous fat (mean \u0394: -24.3\u2009\u00b1\u200941.0\u2009cm<sup>2</sup>) were reduced, while liver density (mean \u0394: +2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5HU) increased, all <i>p</i> < 0.001. When including individuals in all four interventions, GlycA reductions were associated with reductions in visceral adiposity (<i>p</i> < 0.03). Exercise-based lifestyle interventions reduced GlycA concentrations through mechanisms related to exercise-induced modulations of visceral adiposity. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registration Number NCT00962962."
