      "AbstractText": [
        "Maca compounds prescription (MCP) is a common botanical used in dietary supplements, primarily to treat exercise-induced fatigue. The aim of this study is to elucidate the multi-target mechanism of MCP on fatigue management via network pharmacology and gut microbiota analysis. Databases and literature were used to screen the chemical compounds and targets of MCP. Subsequently, 120 active ingredients and 116 fatigue-related targets played a cooperative role in managing fatigue, where several intestine-specific targets indicated the anti-fatigue mechanism of MCP might be closely related to its prebiotics of intestinal bacteria. Thus, forced swimming tests (FSTs) were carried and mice fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Gut microbiota were beneficially regulated in the MCP-treated group in phylum, genus and OTU levels, respectively, and that with a critical correlation included Lactobacillus and <i>Candidatus Planktophila</i>. The results systematically reveal that MCP acts against fatigue on multi-targets with different ingredients and reshapes the gut microbial ecosystem."
