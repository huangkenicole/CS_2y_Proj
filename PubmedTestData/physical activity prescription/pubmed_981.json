        "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with an estimated prevalence approaching 1 million adults in the United States. The disease pathogenesis and resulting damage express as dysfunction (e.g., walking and cognitive impairment) and symptoms (e.g., fatigue and depression) that compromise quality of life (QOL) and full participation. There has been a steadily increasing body of research on the outcomes of exercise among persons with MS, and this has accelerated sharply over the past decade. The current chapter provides a review of exercise and its outcomes, safety, and prescription in MS. This chapter initially reviews the evidence for benefits of exercise based principally on meta-analyses and literature reviews. The chapter then reviews evidence on the safety of exercise in MS and lastly provides guidelines for exercise prescription in MS. Collectively, this chapter serves as an overview and reference for researchers and clinicians interested in the benefits, safety, and prescription of exercise in MS."
