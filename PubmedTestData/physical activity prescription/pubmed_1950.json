        "The mediators of the perception of effort during exercise are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine physiological responses during runs using a rating of perceived exertion (RPE)-clamp model at the RPE corresponding to the gas exchange threshold (RPE<sub>GET</sub>) and 15% above GET (RPE<sub>GET+15%</sub>) to identify potential mediators and performance applications for RPE during treadmill running.",
        "Twenty-one runners ([Formula: see text]<sub>max</sub>\u2009=\u200951.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3\u00a0ml kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) performed a graded exercise test to determine maximal oxygen consumption and the RPE associated with GET and GET\u2009+\u200915% followed by randomized 60\u00a0min RPE-clamp runs at RPE<sub>GET</sub> and RPE<sub>GET+15%</sub>. Mean differences for [Formula: see text], heart rate (HR), minute ventilation ([Formula: see text]), respiratory frequency ([Formula: see text], respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and velocity were compared across each run.",
        "After minute 14, [Formula: see text], RER and velocity did not differ across conditions, but decreased across time (p\u2009<\u20090.05). There was a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interaction for [Formula: see text], where values were significantly higher during RPE-clamp runs at RPE<sub>GET+15%</sub> and decreased across time in both conditions. There were no differences across condition or time for HR, and only small difference between conditions for [Formula: see text].",
        "HR and [Formula: see text] may play a role in mediating the perception of effort, while [Formula: see text], RER, and [Formula: see text] may not. Although HR and [Formula: see text] may mediate the maintenance of a perceptual intensity, they may not be sensitive to differentiate perceptual intensities at GET and GET\u2009+\u200915%. Thus, prescribing exercise using an RPE-clamp model may only reflect a sustainable [Formula: see text] within the moderate intensity domain."
