        "Prescription and monitoring of physical activity are usually based only on heart rate (HR). The objective of this study was to determine the hemodynamic variations induced by resistance exercise.",
        "Healthy male volunteers aged between 18 and 28 (n=11) underwent anthropometric evaluation, measurement of HR and blood pressure and a 10 repetition maximum (RM) test. Subsequently they performed the same exercise on 3 non-consecutive days (>48 h interval) consisting of 3x10 repetitions with 50, 75 and 100% of 10 RM. HR and blood pressure were measured at each interval. These data were used to calculate double product (DP) and myocardial oxygen consumption (mVO2).",
        "HR increased significantly (p<0.05) in all measurements following exercise compared to resting values, but systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed no significant alterations. DP and mVO2 increased in the three series of exercises.",
        "The activity proposed for the study significantly altered HR, in contrast to other studies that show increases in SBP.",
        "The increased cardiac load in the conditions of this study did not involve unnecessary risk for the subjects. The results also help to confirm the theory that monitoring blood pressure together with HR is more effective than the methodology currently used (HR only), particularly for monitoring people at risk of CAD."
