        "Myalgic encephalomyelitis\u00a0/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) are two debilitating, moderately comorbid illnesses in which chronic musculoskeletal pain symptoms are prevalent. These individuals can experience post-exertional malaise (PEM), a phenomenon in which symptom severity is worsened for 24\u2009hours or longer after physical stress, but the pain-related component of PEM is not well characterized.",
        "Systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "Case-control studies involving adults with ME/CFS or FM and measuring pain symptoms before and after exposure to a standardized aerobic exercise test were included. Hedges' d effect sizes were aggregated with random-effects models, and potential moderators were explored with meta-regression analysis. Results were adjusted for nesting effects with three-level modeling.",
        "Forty-five effects were extracted from 15 studies involving 306 patients and 292 healthy controls. After adjusting for nesting effects, we observed a small to moderate effect indicating higher post-exercise pain in patients than in controls (Hedges' d\u2009=\u20090.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.67). The mean effect was significantly moderated by pain measurement time point (b\u2009=\u2009-0.19, z\u2009=\u2009-2.57, P\u2009=\u20090.01), such that studies measuring pain 8-72 hours after exercise showed larger effects (d\u2009=\u20090.71, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.28-1.14) than did those measuring pain 0-2 hours after exercise (d\u2009=\u20090.32, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.10-0.53).",
        "People with ME/CFS and FM experience small to moderate increases in pain severity after exercise, which confirms pain as a component of PEM and emphasizes its debilitating impact in ME/CFS and FM. Future directions include determining mechanisms of pain-related PEM and developing exercise prescriptions that minimize symptom exacerbation in these illnesses."
