        "<b>Aim</b>: To quantify the occurrence of near-to-maximal speed-running bouts in elite soccer players.<b>Methods</b>: Tracking match data from 35 professional players (23 \u00b1 3 yrs) were analysed over four seasons (2015-2019). The number of runs reaching >80, >85 and >90% of players' individual maximal sprinting speed (MSS) was computed. Differences in peak speed occurrences between halves and positions were analysed.<b>Results</b>: Occurrences were not different between halves, but slightly-to-moderately position-dependent, with wingers (3.5 \u00b1 2.0 runs >80% per half) and central midfielders (1.6 \u00b1 1.5 runs >80% per half) performing the most and the least number of near-to-maximal speed-running bouts. Players did not reach >90% of MSS at all in 35% (Attackers) to 65% (Midfielders) of their matches; they reached \u22653 times >90% MSS per match in 2% (Midfielders) to 11% (Attackers) of their matches only. The maximal number of cumulated match occurrences during congested periods was observed in acentral defender (2 runs >90% of MSS every 4 days for 31 days) and a winger (1 run every 4 days for 52 days).<b>Conclusions</b>: The occurrence of near-to-maximal speed-running bouts is low in elite soccer. Match context, playing position and individual player profile are the main determinants of those occurrences."
