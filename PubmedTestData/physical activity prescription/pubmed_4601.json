        "Chronic kidney disease is a systemic disease affecting not only renal function, but also endocrine, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems, with broad impact on functionality. Therefore, the assessment of body composition, peripheral muscle function, and exercise tolerance is also of great importance in this population. In addition, the development of reliable strategies that use feasible tools in clinical practice is of great importance in the functional diagnosis, clinical management and prescription of physical activity.",
        "To assess the relationship between phase angle and peak torque of knee extensors with the performance in six-minute step test of patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis.",
        "Observational and cross-sectional study at Haemodialysis Centre of S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas Hospital. The evaluations took place 3 days before the haemodialysis sessions. On the first day, patients underwent anthropometric evaluation and biochemical tests (lactate, urea, creatinine, albumin, ferritin and growth factor similar to insulin type 1 [IGF1]). On the second day, performed electrical bioimpedance and exercise tolerance assessed using the six-minute step test. On the last day, the evaluation of knee extensor muscles strength using isokinetic dynamometry was performed.",
        "Eighteen subjects were included, with a mean age of 62.3\u2009\u00b1\u200917.6\u2009years. A positive linear correlation was observed between the phase angle, derived from the electrical bioimpedance, and the performance in six-minute step test in these patients. It was also possible to observe a linear correlation between phase angle and IGF1, handgrip strength, peak torque of knee extensors and quality of life questionnaire. The peak torque of knee extensors also presented a linear correlation with IGF1, the performance in six-minute step test and mal-nutrition and inflammation score.",
        "Phase angle and peak torque of knee extensors were correlated with the performance in six-minute step test. Therefore, the phase angle seems to be an important marker of reduced peripheral muscle function and exercise tolerance in haemodialysis patients."
