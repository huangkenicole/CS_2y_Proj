        "Limited estimates of prescribed opioid use among adults with arthritis exist. All-cause (i.e., for any condition) prescribed opioid dispensed (referred to as opioid prescription in the remainder of this abstract) in the past 12 months among U.S. adults aged \u226518 years (n=35,427) were studied, focusing on adults with arthritis (n=12,875).",
        "In 2018-2019, estimates were generated using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data: (1) 2015 prevalence of 1 or more opioid prescriptions to U.S. adults overall and by arthritis status and (2) in 2014-2015, among adults with arthritis, multivariable-adjusted associations between 1 or more opioid prescriptions and sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and healthcare utilization characteristics.",
        "In 2015, the age-standardized prevalence of 1 or more opioid prescriptions among adults with arthritis (29.6%) was almost double of that for all adults (15.4%). Adults with arthritis represented more than half of all adults (55.3%) with at least 1 opioid prescription; among those with 1 or more prescriptions, 43.2% adults had 4 or more prescriptions. The strongest multivariable-adjusted associations with 1 or more opioid prescriptions were ambulatory care visits (1-4: prevalence ratios=1.9-2.0, 5-8: prevalence ratios=2.5-2.7, 9 or more: prevalence ratios=3.4-3.7) and emergency room visits (1: prevalence ratios=1.6, 2-3: prevalence ratios=1.9-2.0, 4 or more: prevalence ratios=2.4); Ref for both: no visits.",
        "Adults with arthritis are a high-need target group for improving pain management, representing more than half of all U.S. adults with 1 or more opioid prescriptions. The association with ambulatory care visits suggests that providers have routine opportunities to discuss comprehensive and integrative pain management strategies, including low-cost evidence-based self-management approaches (e.g., physical activity, self-management education programs, cognitive behavioral therapy). Those with multiple opioid prescriptions may need extra support if transitioning to nonopioid and nonpharmacologic pain management strategies."
