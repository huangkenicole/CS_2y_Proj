        "In a normal clinical environment, foot function and treatment efficacy is evaluated using static foot posture assessment. Whilst there are several methods of static assessment, the longitudinal arch angle (LAA) has been validated as a repeatable and reliable static measure that represents foot posture during midstance whilst walking and running. The main aim of this study was to assess if static LAA is representative of dynamic LAA with the use of orthoses.",
        "17 male subjects with a mean age of 33.4 (SD 12.3) years, mean height of 169.88 (SD 9.2) mm and a mean weight of 72.71 (SD 11.36)kg, who provided an informed consent were included in the study. Orthotic prescription was produced using measurements from a weightbearing goniometer. An optoelectronic movement analysis system was employed to record and analyse the LAA in barefoot, shoe and shoe with orthoses conditions. This data was collected in a static standing condition and then repeated whilst walking.",
        "No significant differences were observed between right static and right dynamic barefoot condition t=1.329 (p=0.05). Same results were observed for right static and right dynamic orthotic condition t=-.233 (p=0.05). Similarly, no significant differences were recorded for left static and left dynamic barefoot condition and orthotic condition t=.303 (p=0.05) and t=.049 (p=0.05) respectively. However, differences were observed within the shoe only condition.",
        "LAA is been shown to be a good static measure for dynamic foot function and can reliably be implemented in a normal clinical environment to evaluate and assess the efficacy of the prescribed foot orthoses."
