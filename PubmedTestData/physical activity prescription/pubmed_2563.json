      "AbstractText": [
        "The aim of this study is to develop equations for aerobic exercise prescription for the intensities of 50, 60, 70 and 80% in healthy subjects of both sexes.",
        "This is a cross-sectional study with convenience sampling drawn from a database of 228 healthy subjects who were randomized into the regression group (GR: 197 subjects (male = 143 and female = 54)) and cross-validation group (CVG: 31 individuals [men = 20 and women = 11]). Kohavi's assumptions were followed in relation to cross-validation and bootstrap for precision estimation and model selection. The GR was used to build the estimation equations from the multiple linear regression. The CVG was determined to analyze the validity in the estimation equations. The equations to determine the intensities were constructed by means of multiple regression, the independent variables were determined by the stepwise method, observing the significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05.",
        "The reliability level of Cronbach's alpha of the multiple linear regression equations was moderate for the intensity of 50% (0.51); for the intensities of 60, 70 and 80%, it corresponded to 0.50, 0.53 and 0.57, respectively.",
        "The results show that it is possible to apply the equations in the determination of aerobic exercise intensities for healthy individuals. However, the need for further studies in other populations to prove the reliability of the proposed equations is evident."
