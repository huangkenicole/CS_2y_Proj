        "The association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and obesity can decrease the patients' cardiopulmonary capacity, physical functioning and quality of life. The search for effective and practical alternative methods of exercise to engage patients in training programs is of great importance. Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of home-based versus center-based aerobic exercise on the cardiopulmonary and functional capacities, quality of life and quality of sleep of overweight non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD (NDD-CKD).",
        "Forty sedentary overweight patients CKD stages 3 and 4 were randomly assigned to an exercise group [home-based group (n\u00a0=\u00a012) or center-based exercise group (n\u00a0=\u00a013)] or to a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a015) that did not perform any exercise. Cardiopulmonary exercise test, functional capacity tests, quality of life, quality of sleep and clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 12 and 24\u00a0weeks.",
        "The VO<sub>2peak</sub> and all cardiopulmonary parameters evaluated were similarly improved (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after 12 and 24\u00a0weeks in both exercise groups. The functional capacity tests improved during the follow-up in the home-based group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reached values similar to those obtained in the center-based group. The benefits achieved in both exercise groups were also reflected in improvement of quality of life and sleep (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No differences were observed between the exercise groups, and no changes in any of the parameters investigated were found in the control group.",
        "Home-based aerobic training was as effective as center-based training in improving the physical and functional capabilities, quality of life and sleep in overweight NDD-CKD patients."
