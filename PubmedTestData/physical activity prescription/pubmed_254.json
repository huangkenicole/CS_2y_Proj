        "To synthesize the details of the exercises/exercise program prescribed for the improvement of muscle mass/muscle strength/physical performance among sarcopenic older adults.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted in five electronic databases and the details of exercises such as single component or multicomponent exercise program, frequency/week, intensity, duration of the exercise program, type of exercises, progression, adverse events reported, outcome measures used, and whether technology or other educational aids were used to deliver the program were extracted.",
        "A total of 10,045 records were identified and 27 records were included. Resistance exercises were included in all the studies, with the frequency ranging from 1 to 5/week, intensity ranging from 20 to 80% of 1 repetition maximum (RM), or 6-14 points on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and duration per session ranging from 20 to 75\u00a0min. The intensity of aerobic exercises ranged from 50 to 70% of heart rate max or a level of 7-17 in RPE with a duration ranging from 6 to 30\u00a0min per session for 2-5\u00a0days/week. For balance exercises, the intensity was mentioned as the level of effort 3 on a scale of 10, and the time duration per session ranged from 5 to 30\u00a0min for a frequency of 2/3 per week.",
        "This review synthesized the components of exercise prescription for sarcopenic older adults which would help practitioners and researchers in selecting the frequency, intensity, duration, type, mode, and progression while prescribing exercises."
