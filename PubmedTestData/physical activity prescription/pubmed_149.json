        "To examine the relationship between time spent in light physical activity (LPA) and in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the pattern of accumulation on the risk for major mobility disability (MMD) in a large multicenter study of physical activity (PA) and aging, the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.",
        "Data were collected from individuals randomized to a PA intervention as part of the LIFE study, an eight-center single-blind randomized clinical trial conducted between February 2010 and December 2013.",
        "Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Study PARTICIPANTS: Older adult participants (78.4\u2009years; N = 507) at risk for MMD.",
        "All older adults included in these analyses were randomized to a structured PA intervention that included two center-based plus three to four home-based exercise sessions per week with a primary goal of walking for 150\u2009minutes weekly. Participants attended the intervention for 2.5\u2009years on average.",
        "MMD was defined as the inability to complete a 400-m walk within 15\u2009minutes and without assistance. Physical function was assessed via the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Actigraph accelerometers were used to quantify amount and variability in LPA and MVPA.",
        "In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified a significant interaction (P =\u2009.017) between SPPB score and LPA amount and variability such that more LPA was associated with a reduced risk for MMD among those with higher initial function, as was lower variability (eg, via distributing LPA across the day). The SPPB\u2009\u00d7\u2009MVPA interaction was significant (P =\u2009.04), such that more MVPA was associated with lower MMD risk among those with lower function. Finally, greater MVPA variability was associated with lower risk for MMD.",
        "A prescription of PA for older adults should account for key factors such as physical function and emphasize both amount and pattern of accumulation of PA from across the intensity continuum. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1476-1483, 2020."
