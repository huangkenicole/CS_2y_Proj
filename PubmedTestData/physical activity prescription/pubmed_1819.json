        "a previous study of the cost of smoking to the New Zealand health services estimated that the excess hospital resource use generated by smoking amounted to $81 million in 1986 dollars. The present study refined and updated the figures for hospital resource use, and extended the costing exercise to include aspects of primary health care.",
        "excess hospital costs attributable to smoking were estimated from the 1987 national hospital discharge data (both public and private hospitals), and figures obtained from the Otago resource utilisation system (RUS). The costs of excess prescription medicines use and general practitioner consultations were estimated from existing data sources.",
        "the excess hospital costs attributable to smoking totalled $128.3 million. A further $37.8 million was consumed in excess prescription medicines use, plus $19.3 million in general practitioner consultations. The total cost to the health services of cigarette smoking was therefore conservatively estimated at $185.4 million (in 1989 dollars).",
        "previous estimates substantially underestimate the external costs imposed by smoking. The figure of $185.4 million contrasts with the $7.5 million of sponsorship support which the tobacco industry is estimated to provide for New Zealand sports. Politicians who intend to repeal Part 2 of the Smokefree Environments Act (1990) should consider these external costs imposed on society by cigarette smoking."
