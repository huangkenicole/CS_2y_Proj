      "AbstractText": [
        "Since early 2022, patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection have increased rapidly in Shanghai, China. Nevertheless, there is no widely used unified rehabilitation treatment available for discharged patients with post-infection sequelae such as dyspnea, depression, and fatigue. To promote the rehabilitation of discharged patients, our team formulated Kangyi Qiangshen Gong exercise prescription on the basis of traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation exercises (TCMRE). We designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation and advantages of KQG for discharged patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.",
        "This is a parallel-design, two-arm, analyst assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. In total, 60 discharged patients with COVID-19 sequelae, aged from 20 to 80\u00a0years will be recruited and randomly assigned to the World Health Organization instructed breathing techniques (BT) group and the Kangyi Qiangshen Gong exercise prescription (KQG) group at a ratio of 1:1. The patients in the BT group will perform breathing techniques exercise, and the patients in the KQG group will perform KQG exercise. Both groups will perform exercises twice a day for 3\u00a0months. The primary outcome will be measured with the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and the secondary outcomes will include the Modified Borg Scale, Fatigue Scale-14, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Respiratory Symptoms Scale. Clinical scales will be assessed at three points (pre-exercise, 3\u00a0months post-exercise, and 3\u00a0months follow-up). Adverse events will be recorded for safety assessment.",
        "This trial will serve high-quality evidence of the value of KQG for treating discharged patients with COVID-19 in rehabilitation period.",
        "Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2200059504. Registered on 03 May 2022.",
        "The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through the study's website, and conferences."
