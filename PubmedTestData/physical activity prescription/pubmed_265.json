        "To describe barriers to physical activity (PA) in type 2 diabetes patients and their general practitioners (GPs), looking for practitioner's influence on PA practice of their patients.",
        "We conducted a cross-sectional study on GPs (n = 48) and their type 2 diabetes patients (n = 369) measuring respectively barriers to prescribe and practice PA using a self-assessment questionnaire: barriers to physical activity in diabetes (BAPAD). Statistical analysis was performed accounting hierarchical data structure. Similar practitioner's patients were considered a cluster sharing common patterns.",
        "The higher the patient's BAPAD score, the higher the barriers to PA, the higher the risk to declare practicing no PA (p<0.001), low frequency and low duration of PA (p<0.001). A high patient's BAPAD score was also associated with a higher risk to have HbA1c \u22657% (53 mmol/mol) (p = 0.001). The intra-class correlation coefficient between type 2 diabetes patients and GPs was 34%, indicating a high cluster effect. A high GP's BAPAD score, regarding the PA prescription, is predictive of a high BAPAD score with their patients, regarding their practice (p = 0.03).",
        "Type 2 diabetes patients with lower BAPAD score, thus lower barriers to physical activity, have a higher PA level and a better glycemic control. An important and deleterious cluster effect between GPs and their patients is demonstrated: the higher the GP's BAPAD score, the higher the type 2 diabetes patients' BAPAD score. This important cluster effect might designate GPs as a relevant lever for future interventions regarding patient's education towards PA and type 2 diabetes management."
