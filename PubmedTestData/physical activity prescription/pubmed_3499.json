        "Background It remains unknown whether individuals who regularly use preventive medications receive the same benefit from healthy lifestyle as those who do not use medications. We aimed to examine the associations of healthy lifestyle with mortality according to use of major preventive medications, including aspirin, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering medications. Methods and Results Among 79\u00a0043 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1988-2014) and 39\u00a0544 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014), we defined a healthy lifestyle score based on body mass index, smoking, physical activity, diet, and alcohol intake. We estimated multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and population-attributable risks of death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other causes in relation to healthy lifestyle according to medication use. We documented 35\u00a0195 deaths. A similar association of healthy lifestyle score with lower all-cause mortality was observed among medication users (HR, 0.82 per unit increment; 95% CI, 0.81-0.82) and nonusers (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.83) (<i>P</i> interaction=0.54). The fraction of premature deaths that might be prevented by adherence to the 5 healthy lifestyle factors among medication users and nonusers was 38% (95% CI, 32%-42%) and 40% (95% CI, 29%-50%) for all-cause mortality, 37% (95% CI, 27%-46%) and 45% (95% CI, 18%-66%) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 38% (95% CI, 28%-46%) and 33% (95% CI, 14%-49%) for cancer mortality, respectively. Conclusions Adherence to a healthy lifestyle confers substantial benefit for prevention of premature death among both regular users and nonusers of preventive medications. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains important even among individuals regularly using preventive medications."

  "CoiStatement": "Our study has several strengths, including the large sample size, long\u2010term follow\u2010up of up to 28\u00a0years, detailed and repeated assessment of medication use, and rigorous adjustment for potential confounding factors. Several limitations should also be noted. First, we applied a less stringent threshold to define healthy lifestyle (eg, the upper limit for BMI was set at 27.5 rather than 25, as commonly used to define normal body weight) to preserve statistical power because even with the current threshold, only 3% to 4% of participants met the healthy criteria for all of the 5 lifestyle factors. Therefore, the PARs for healthy lifestyles may have been underestimated. Second, our medication, lifestyle, and anthropometric (eg, height and weight) data were all based on self\u2010report and thus subject to measurement error. However, the accuracy and stability of these self\u2010reported data have been well documented in our cohorts,\n<sup>52</sup>\n, \n<sup>53</sup>\n, \n<sup>54</sup>\n as well as other study populations.\n<sup>55</sup>\n Third, our study participants were all health professionals and predominantly white, thereby limiting our ability to stratify the analyses by race and reducing the generalizability of our findings. However, it is unlikely that the biological effect of lifestyle would have a substantial difference between health professionals and the general population. Moreover, given the higher health consciousness and better lifestyle profiles of health professionals, we may have underestimated the benefit of lifestyles on the population scale. A healthy lifestyle may confer similar substantial benefit in preventing premature death in regular users and nonusers of preventive medications. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle is still important even among individuals regularly using preventive medications.
