Immunometabolic responses to concurrent training: the effects of exercise order in recreational weightlifters. J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 1960-1967, 2016-The relationship between immunometabolic response and performance is not well understood. This study evaluated the influence of concurrent strength and high-intensity aerobic sequence of exercise order between sessions on strength performance, metabolic, and inflammatory response. Eleven recreational weightlifters underwent the following 2 randomized sessions: (a) strength-aerobic exercise order (SA) and (b) aerobic-strength exercise order (AS). Blood samples were collected before (Pre) and immediately after the first exercise (Post-1) and the second exercise (Post-2) of each session. The SA condition presented a higher number of repetitions (SA: 54 \u00b1 15 vs. AS: 43 \u00b1 12) and total volume (SA: 7,265 \u00b1 2,323 vs. AS: 5,794 \u00b1 1846 kg) than the AS condition (both p = 0.001). Glucose was higher in Pre when compared with post-1 in both orders (p \u2264 0.05); changes in lactate were time-dependent in the different orders (p \u2264 0.05); however, AS post-2 lactate was lower when compared with SA post-2 (p \u2264 0.05). Interleukin-6 levels showed time-dependent changes for both exercise orders (p \u2264 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) level was increased only in AS post-1 (AS: pre = 21.91 \u00b1 35.47, post-1 = 26.99 \u00b1 47.69 pg\u00b7ml vs. SA: pre = 25.74 \u00b1 43.64, post-1 = 29.74 \u00b1 46.05 pg\u00b7ml, p \u2264 0.05). These results suggest that concurrent training order exhibits different immunometabolic responses and, at least in part, can be associated with the acute decline in strength performance induced by concurrent exercise. Our results point to a possible role of TNF-\u03b1 (post-1 AS condition) as a trigger to restore the energy demand by providing substrates to help maintain contractile activity in skeletal muscle."
