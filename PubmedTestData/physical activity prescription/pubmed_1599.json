        "Dancing is an attractive form of exercise among older adults and may positively influence physical and psychosocial health. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence examining the dance prescription and effectiveness of dance in community dwelling older adults.",
        "Eight databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of dance programs on community-dwelling older adults from 2007 to December 2020. Data regarding participants, dance programs and outcomes of interest were extracted and narratively synthesized. A meta-analysis was performed on the outcome data where possible.",
        "Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, of those 15 were deemed to be fair quality and 7 high quality using the PEDro scale. Nineteen studies included in the meta-analysis found that dancing can improve mobility and endurance compared to no intervention and afforded equivalent outcomes compared to other exercise programs.",
        "The findings suggest that dance is an effective, safe and viable activity for community-dwelling older adults.."
