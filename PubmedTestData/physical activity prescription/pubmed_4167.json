        "In people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), limb-muscle dysfunction is one of the most troublesome systemic manifestations of the disease, which at the functional level is evidenced by reduced strength and endurance of limb muscles. Improving limb-muscle function is an important therapeutic goal of COPD management, for which resistance training is recommended. However, current guidelines for resistance training in COPD mainly focus on improving muscle strength which only reflects one aspect of limb-muscle function and does not address the issue of reduced muscle endurance. The latter is of importance considering that the reduction in limb-muscle endurance often is greater than that of muscle weakness, and also, limb-muscle endurance seems to be closer related to walking capacity as well as arm function than to limb-muscle strength within this group of people. Thus, strategies targeting multiple aspects of the decreased muscle function are warranted to increase the possibility for an optimal effect for the individual patient. Periodized resistance training, which represents a planned variation of resistance training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, frequency, etc.), is one strategy that could be used to target limb-muscle strength as well as limb-muscle endurance within the same exercise regimen.",
        "This is an international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing the effect and feasibility of non-linear periodized resistance training to traditional non-periodized resistance training in people with COPD. Primary outcomes are dynamic limb-muscle strength and endurance. Secondary outcomes include static limb-muscle strength and endurance, functional performance, quality of life, dyspnea, intramuscular adaptations as well as the proportion of responders. Feasibility of the training programs will be assessed and compared on attendance rate, duration, satisfaction, drop-outs as well as occurrence and severity of any adverse events.",
        "The proposed trial will provide new knowledge to this research area by investigating and comparing the feasibility and effects of non-linear periodized resistance training compared to traditional non-periodized resistance training. If the former strategy produces larger physiological adaptations than non-periodized resistance training, this project may influence the prescription of resistance training in people with COPD.",
