        "The goal of cardiac rehabilitation is to assist the patient in regaining, as close as possible, normal functioning. Participation in an exercise program is one way to achieve this objective. Exercise improves not only the physiologic state of the patient, but also produces many psychosocial benefits. However, exercise prescription is different for cardiac patients, according to the factors associated with the type of cardiac pathology and the surgical intervention. The goal of this article is to inform and guide the nurse in prescribing exercise for cardiac patients. A case study of a patient with cardiac pathologies such as angina, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure is presented. The nurse will learn how to prescribe the appropriate types of activities as well as the intensity, duration and frequency of the training sessions. The nurse will also be able to recommend appropriate physical activities for phase II of cardiac rehabilitation, a phase embracing the time from hospital discharge through the following three months. Finally, a list of activities and hobbies, with various energy costs, is presented."
