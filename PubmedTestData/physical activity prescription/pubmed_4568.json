        "Few older adults are able to achieve recommended levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity despite known cognitive benefits. Alternatively, less intense activities such as standing can be easily integrated into daily life. No existing study has examined the impact of free-living standing activity during daily life as measured by a device on cognition in older adults. Our purpose was to examine the association between free-living standing activity and cognitive function in cognitively healthy older adults.",
        "Participants were 98 adults aged 65 years or older from the ongoing MIND trial (NCT02817074) without diagnoses or symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Linear regression analyses tested cross-sectional associations between standing activity (duration and intensity from the MoveMonitor+ accelerometer/gyroscope) and cognition (4 cognitive domains constructed from 12 cognitive performance tests).",
        "Participants were on average 69.7 years old (SD = 3.7), 69.4% women, and 73.5% had a college degree or higher. Higher mean intensity of standing activity was significantly associated with higher levels of perceptual speed when adjusting for age, gender, and education level. Each log unit increase in standing activity intensity was associated with 0.72 units higher of perceptual speed (p = .023). When we additionally adjusted for cognitive activities and moderate-vigorous physical activity, and then also for body mass index, depressive symptoms, prescription medication use, and device wear time, the positive association remained.",
        "These findings should be further explored in longitudinal analyses and interventions for cognition that incorporate small changes to free-living activity in addition to promoting moderate-vigorous physical activity."
