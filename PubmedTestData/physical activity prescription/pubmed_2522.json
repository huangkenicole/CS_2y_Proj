        "Physical exercises are the first step of therapy for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",
        "The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic exercise training with or without diet to ameliorate liver function, insulin resistance, and lipids in adults.",
        "We searched relevant databases up to 10 June 2021 for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials lasting 4 or more weeks that investigated the effects of aerobic exercise alone or accompanied by diet on change in liver enzymes, intrahepatic fat (IHF), insulin resistance, and lipids.",
        "Sixteen studies including 2255 participants were included. There was a significant pooled weighted mean differences (MD) for the comparison between aerobic exercise versus control in alanine aminotransferase (ALT; <i>p</i> = 0.003), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; <i>p</i> = 0.006), IHF (<i>p</i> = 0.0004), body mass (<i>p</i> = 0.0003), and body mass index (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Moreover, there was a significant pooled MD for the comparison between aerobic exercise plus diet versus control in ALT (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), AST (<i>p</i> = 0.01), IHF (<i>p</i> = 0.02), GGT (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), insulin (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), HOMA-IR (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), body mass (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01).",
        "Our findings demonstrate a role for aerobic exercise with and without diet protocol as a therapeutic purpose, and suggest that evaluation of aerobic training levels and aerobic training prescription plus diet should be routine in NAFLD."
