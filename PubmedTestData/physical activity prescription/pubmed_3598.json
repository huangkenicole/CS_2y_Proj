      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to compare the effects of four velocity-based training (VBT) programs in bench press (BP) between a wide range of velocity loss (VL) thresholds-0% (VL0), 15% (VL15), 25% (VL25), and 50% (VL50)-on strength gains, neuromuscular adaptations, and muscle hypertrophy.",
        "Sixty-four resistance-trained young men were randomly assigned into four groups (VL0, VL15, VL25, and VL50) that differed in the VL allowed in each set. Subjects followed a VBT program for 8-weeks using the BP exercise. Before and after the VBT program the following tests were performed: (a) cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of pectoralis major (PM) muscle; (b) maximal isometric test; (c) progressive loading test; and (d) fatigue test.",
        "Significant group x time interactions were observed for CSA (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and peak root mean square in PM (peak RMS-PM, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). VL50 showed significantly greater gains in CSA than VL0 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Only the VL15 group showed significant increases in peak RMS-PM (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Moreover, only VL0 showed significant gains in the early rate of force development (RFD, P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), while VL25 and VL50 improved in the late RFD (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.01-.05). No significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions were found for any of the dynamic strength variables analyzed, although all groups showed significant improvements in all these parameters.",
        "Higher VL thresholds allowed for a greater volume load which maximized muscle hypertrophy, whereas lower VL thresholds evoked positive neuromuscular-related adaptations. No significant differences were found between groups for strength gains, despite the wide differences in the total volume accumulated by each group."
