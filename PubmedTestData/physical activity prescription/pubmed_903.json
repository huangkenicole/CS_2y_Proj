        "To date quantitative meta-analysis with large samples to investigate the effects and potential moderators of physical activity (PA) on executive function (EF) in older adults with dementia is insufficient. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis.",
        "Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).",
        "Old people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementia of varying types and severity as the primary diagnosis.",
        "PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies published from 01 January, 2010 to 01 March, 2022. The results of executive function were reported in all RCTs. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the size of effects. Subgroup analyses of three moderators (including the specific sub-domains of EF, exercise prescription variables, and sample characteristics) were performed.",
        "Eighteen RCTs were included with a combined sample size of 1366. Overall, PA interventions improved overall EF (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.41, p<0.05). The EF sub-domain \"planning\" was significant moderator (SMD=0.31, 95%CI 0.11 to 1.51, p<0.01), but inhibitory control, working memory and cognitive flexibility were not significant. Regarding exercise prescription variables, type of resistance training; moderate intensity; total duration \u226424 weeks and short (once or twice a week) frequency improved overall EF performance. Session length may be a moderator. Regarding sample characteristics, old-old, AD and both dementia and AD had significant benefits.",
        "EF in older adults with AD or related dementia benefited from physical activity, and the benefit was affected by the type, intensity, total duration, frequency of exercise. Physical activity can be an alternative intervention in aging patients with dementia, to improve EF performance or prevent or EF decline."
