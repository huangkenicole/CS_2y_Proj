        "As the US population ages, generalist physicians will be charged with keeping the elderly healthy and active in their later years. Exercise is recommended for the treatment of many chronic medical conditions found in the geriatric population; it is also recommended to prevent certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Physicians have already had an impact on the smoking habits within the United States. By recognizing that exercise is safe and beneficial for a number of conditions, physicians can positively impact their patients' health care by emphasizing the importance of regular physical activity. This article demonstrates the safety and efficacy of exercise as an adjunctive treatment, and briefly outlines some tools for exercise prescription."
