        "The primary objective of this non-randomized feasibility study was to test a 1-year model programme for sustaining/increasing patients' motivation to perform daily physical activity.",
        "Non-randomized longitudinal feasibility study with a one-group repeated measures design.",
        "The study took place at a primary care centre in mid-Sweden in 2017-2018. The model programme included individual and group-based support, individualized physical activity prescriptions, a wrist-worn activity tracker and an activity diary. The main outcomes were the participants' perceptions of programme feasibility and scores on the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale.",
        "Seven patients were recruited. Six patients completed the programme that was perceived to imply learning, motivation and support. Compared with baseline, the median score of the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale improved 3\u00a0months after participants completed the programme."
