        "<b><i>Significance:</i></b> Regular exercise training can reduce myocardial damage caused by acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Exercise can reproduce the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning, due to the capacity of brief periods of ischemia to reduce myocardial damage caused by acute I/R. In addition, exercise may also activate the multiple kinase cascade responsible for cardioprotection even in the absence of ischemia. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Animal and human studies highlighted the fact that, besides to reduce risk factors related to cardiovascular disease, the beneficial effects of exercise are also due to its ability to induce conditioning of the heart. Exercise behaves as a physiological stress that triggers beneficial adaptive cellular responses, inducing a protective phenotype in the heart. The factors contributing to the exercise-induced heart preconditioning include stimulation of the anti-radical defense system and nitric oxide production, opioids, myokines, and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) dependent potassium channels. They appear to be also involved in the protective effect exerted by exercise against cardiotoxicity related to chemotherapy. <b><i>Critical Issues and Future Directions:</i></b> Although several experimental evidences on the protective effect of exercise have been obtained, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been fully clarified. Further studies are warranted to define precise exercise prescriptions in patients at risk of myocardial infarction or undergoing chemotherapy."
