        "This study examined the acute and resting changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inteleukin-6 (IL-6) and if changes in these biomarkers were correlated during resistance training (RT). Fifteen men with \u22652 years of RT experience (age: 23 \u00b1 3 years, body mass: 84.4 \u00b1 12.3 kg) participated. Subjects performed RT 3\u00d7/week for 6 weeks in either a high-repetition (HR; <i>n</i> = 8) or low-repetition (LR; <i>n</i> = 7) group. Protocols during week 1 were HR - Monday: 4 (sets) \u00d7 12 (repetitions) at 60% of 1-repetition maximum, Wednesday: 4 \u00d7 10 at 65%, Friday: 5 \u00d7 8 at 70%; LR - Monday: 8 \u00d7 6 at 75%, Wednesday 9 \u00d7 4 at 80%, Friday: 10 \u00d7 2 at 85%. Total volume was equated for the 6 weeks but not for individual sessions. Greater volume and intensity were performed in LR versus HR (<i>p</i> < 0.01) on Mondays. Plasma was collected immediately before and after exercise of the Monday session. There were no significant interactions or main effects for BDNF (<i>p</i> > 0.05). There was a moderate between-group effect size (0.57) in favor of LR in week 6, suggesting a potentially greater acute increase in BDNF in LR versus HR. For IL-6, a statistically significant main effect was observed for training (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), showing an acute increase in IL-6 in both weeks (<i>p</i> < 0.01); however, no other 3-way or 2-way interactions existed (<i>p</i> > 0.05). A minimum volume threshold of RT may be needed to induce acute elevations in BDNF. <b>Novelty</b> A minimum RT volume threshold may be needed to elicit BDNF. A close proximity to failure may be needed to elicit BDNF. BDNF and IL-6 did not correlate."
