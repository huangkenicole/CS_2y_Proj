        "Exercise prescription based on fixed heart rate (HR) values is not associated with a specific work rate (WR) during prolonged exercise. This phenomenon has never been evaluated in cardiac patients and might be associated with a slow component of HR kinetics and \u03b2-adrenergic activity. The aims were to quantify, in cardiac patients, the WR decrease at a fixed HR and to test if it would be attenuated by \u03b2-blockers.",
        "Seventeen patients with coronary artery disease in stable conditions (69 \u00b1 9 yr) were divided into two groups according to the presence (BB) or absence (no-BB) of a therapy with \u03b2-blockers, and performed on a cycle ergometer: an incremental exercise (INCR) and a 15-min \"HR CLAMPED \" exercise, in which WR was continuously adjusted to maintain a constant HR, corresponding to the gas exchange threshold +15%. HR was determined by the ECG signal, and pulmonary gas exchange was assessed breath-by-breath.",
        "During INCR, HR peak was lower in BB versus no-BB ( P < 0.05), whereas no differences were observed for other variables. During HR CLAMPED , the decrease in WR needed to maintain HR constant was less pronounced in BB versus no-BB (-16% \u00b1 10% vs -27 \u00b1 10, P = 0.04) and was accompanied by a decreased V\u0307O 2 only in no-BB (-13% \u00b1 6%, P < 0.001).",
        "The decrease in WR during a 15-min exercise at a fixed HR (slightly higher than that at gas exchange threshold) was attenuated in BB, suggesting a potential role by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. The phenomenon may represent, also in this population, a sign of impaired exercise tolerance and interferes with aerobic exercise prescription."
