        "To explore the associations among activation, physical activity, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and healthy days in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who participated in wellness programs.",
        "Observational, longitudinal cohort study utilizing survey, claims, and wellness program data.",
        "From January to May 2018, individuals enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plan with T2D (aged 55-89 years) and SilverSneakers or step count data were eligible. Three waves of surveys were mailed (n\u2009=\u20095000) to collect information on activation (Consumer Health Activation Index; Influence, Motivation, and Patient Activation for Diabetes) and health-related quality of life (Healthy Days). Generalized linear models and predictive models evaluated the associations of unhealthy days and HbA1c with physical activity and activation factors. Additional models tested the relationship between physical activity and future acute care visits, accounting for potential confounders via inverse probability of treatment weighting.",
        "Respondents to all 3 waves (n\u2009=\u20091147) had higher comorbidity indices but lower HbA1c than individuals with T2D without physical activity data (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Individuals with moderate and high activation levels had 67.4% to 74.0% and 71.6% to 85.6% fewer unhealthy days, respectively, than those with lower activation (P\u2009<\u2009.01). Individuals with high (>\u20098000/day) step counts at baseline were predicted to have 2.04 fewer unhealthy days/month at follow-up (P\u2009<\u2009.05) and 0.19% (P\u2009<\u2009.02) lower HbA1c units, respectively, compared with those with less than 4000 steps per day. High SilverSneakers activity (>\u20092 activities per week) reduced subsequent acute care visits by 49%.",
        "Increasing patient activation levels encourages physical activity, which can help improve glycemic control and health-related quality of life, especially among older adults."
