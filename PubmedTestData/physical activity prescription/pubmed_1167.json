        "There are few proven strategies to enhance physical activity and cardiometabolic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We examined the effects of physician-delivered step count prescriptions and monitoring.",
        "Participants randomized to the active arm were provided with pedometers and they recorded step counts. Over a 1-year period, their physicians reviewed their records and provided a written step count prescription at each clinic visit. The overall goal was a 3000 steps/day increase over 1 year (individualized rate of increase). Control arm participants were advised to engage in physical activity 30 to 60 min/day. We evaluated effects on step counts, carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV, primary) and other cardiometabolic indicators including haemoglobin A1c in diabetes (henceforth abbreviated as A1c) and Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in participants not receiving insulin therapy.",
        "A total of 79% completed final evaluations (275/347; mean age, 60 years; SD, 11). Over 66% of participants had type 2 diabetes and over 90% had hypertension. There was a net 20% increase in steps/day in active vs control arm participants (1190; 95% CI, 550-1840). Changes in cfPWV were inconclusive; active vs control arm participants with type 2 diabetes experienced a decrease in A1c (-0.38%; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.06). HOMA-IR also declined in the active arm vs the control arm (ie, assessed in all participants not treated with insulin; -0.96; 95% CI, -1.72 to -0.21).",
        "A simple physician-delivered step count prescription strategy incorporated into routine clinical practice led to a net 20% increase in step counts; however, this was below the 3000 steps/day targeted increment. While conclusive effects on cfPWV were not observed, there were improvements in both A1c and insulin sensitivity. Future studies will evaluate an amplified intervention to increase impact."
