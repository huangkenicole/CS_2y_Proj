        "The aim of this study was to examine how respiratory (RT) and lactate thresholds (LT) are affected by acute heat exposure in the two most commonly used incremental exercise test protocols (RAMP and STEP) for functional evaluation of aerobic fitness, exercise prescription and monitoring training intensities.",
        "Eleven physically active male participants performed four incremental exercise tests, two RAMP (30\u00a0W\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) and two STEP (40\u00a0W\u00b73\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>), both in 18\u00a0\u00b0C (TEMP) and 36\u00a0\u00b0C (HOT) with 40% relative humidity to determine 2 RT and 16 LT, respectively. Distinction was made within LT, taking into account the individual lactate kinetics (LT<sub>IND</sub>) and fixed value lactate concentrations (LT<sub>FIX</sub>).",
        "A decrease in mean power output (PO) was observed in HOT at LT (-6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%), more specific LT<sub>IND</sub> (-5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4%) and LT<sub>FIX</sub> (-7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4%), compared to TEMP, however not at RT (-1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7%). The individual PO difference in HOT compared to TEMP over all threshold methods ranged from -53\u00a0W to\u2009+26\u00a0W. Mean heart rate (HR) did not differ in LT, while it was increased at RT in HOT (+10\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0bpm).",
        "This study showed that exercise thresholds were affected when ambient air temperature was increased. However, a considerable degree of variability in the sensitivity of the different threshold concepts to acute heat exposure was found and a large individual variation was noticed. Test design and procedures should be taken into account when interpreting exercise test outcomes."
