        "To evaluate the feasibility of \"threshold-based\" aerobic exercise prescription in cardiovascular disease, we aimed to quantify the proportion of patients whose clinical cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) permit identification of estimated lactate threshold (\u03b8<sub>LT</sub>) and respiratory compensation point (RCP) and to characterize the variability at which these thresholds occur.",
        "Breath-by-breath CPET data of 1102 patients (65 \u00b1 12 years) referred to cardiac rehabilitation were analyzed to identify peak O<sub>2</sub> uptake (V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub>; mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> and mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) and \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> and RCP (reported as V\u02d9O<sub>2</sub>, %V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub>, and %peak heart rate [%HR<sub>peak</sub>]). Patients were grouped by the presence or absence of thresholds: group 0: neither \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> nor RCP; group 1: \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> only; and group 2: both \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> and RCP.",
        "Mean V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub> was 1523 \u00b1 627 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (range: 315-3789 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) or 18.0 \u00b1 6.5 mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (5.2-46.5 mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) and HR<sub>peak</sub> was 123 \u00b1 24 beats per minute (bpm) (52 bpm-207 bpm). There were 556 patients (50%) in group 0, 196 (18%) in group 1, and 350 (32%) in group 2. In group 1, mean \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> was 1240 \u00b1 410 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (580-2560 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>), 75% \u00b1 8%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub> (52%-92%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub>), or 84%\u00a0\u00b1 6%HR<sub>peak</sub> (64%-96%HR<sub>peak</sub>). In group 2, \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> was 1390 \u00b1 360 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (640-2430 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>), 70% \u00b1 8%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub> (41%-88%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub>), or 78% \u00b1 7%HR<sub>peak</sub> (52%-96%HR<sub>peak</sub>), and RCP was 1680 \u00b1 440 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> (730-3090 mL\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>), 84% \u00b1 7%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub> (54%-99%V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub>), or 87% \u00b1 6%HR<sub>peak</sub> (59%-99%HR<sub>peak</sub>). Compared with group 1, \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> in group 2 occurred at a higher V\u02d9O<sub>2</sub> but lower %V\u02d9O<sub>2peak</sub> and %HR<sub>peak</sub> (P < 0.05).",
        "Only 32% of CPETs exhibited both \u03b8<sub>LT</sub> and RCP despite flexibility in protocol options. Commonly used step-based protocols are suboptimal for \"threshold-based\" exercise prescription."
