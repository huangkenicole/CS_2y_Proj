        "Little is known about the responses of girl athletes to training interventions throughout maturation. This study evaluated group and individual responses to an 8-week, mixed-methods, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programme in girl football players. Thirty-seven players (age 13.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0years) were tested for 20-m speed, repeated-sprint ability, change-of-direction speed and level 1 yo-yo intermittent recovery (YYIR). Players were subcategorised into before-, at- and after-PHV (peak height velocity) based on maturity offset. Very likely moderate (25%; \u00b190% confidence limits\u00a0=\u00a09.2) improvements occurred in YYIR, but data were unclear in players before-PHV with moderate individual differences in response. Decrements in repeated-sprint ability were most likely very large (6.5%; \u00b13.2) before-PHV, and likely moderate (1.7%; \u00b11.0) at-PHV. Data were unclear after-PHV. A very likely moderate (2.7%; \u00b11.0) decrement occurred in change-of-direction speed at-PHV while there was a very likely increase (-2.4%; \u00b11.3) in after-PHV players. Possibly small (-1.1%; \u00b11.4) improvements in 20-m speed occurred before-PHV but the effect was otherwise unclear with moderate to large individual differences. These data reflect specific responses to training interventions in girls of different biological maturity, while highlighting individual responses to HIIT interventions. This can assist practitioners in providing effective training prescription."
