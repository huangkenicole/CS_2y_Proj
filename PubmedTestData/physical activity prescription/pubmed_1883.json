        "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by pronounced exercise intolerance and exaggerated blood pressure reactivity during exercise. Classic mechanisms of exercise intolerance in CKD have been extensively described previously and include uremic myopathy, chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and anemia. We contend that these classic mechanisms only partially explain the exercise intolerance experienced in CKD and that alterations in cardiovascular and autonomic regulation also play a key contributing role. The purpose of this review is to examine the physiological factors that contribute to neurocirculatory dysregulation during exercise and discuss the adaptations that result from regular exercise training in CKD. Key neurocirculatory mechanisms contributing to exercise intolerance in CKD include augmentation of the exercise pressor reflex, aberrations in neurocirculatory control, and increased neurovascular transduction. In addition, we highlight how some contributing factors may be improved through exercise training, with a specific focus on the sympathetic nervous system. Important areas for future work include understanding how the exercise prescription may best be optimized in CKD and how the beneficial effects of exercise training may extend to the brain."
