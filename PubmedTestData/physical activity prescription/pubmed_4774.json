        "This study aims to (1) evaluate the clinical safety of an exercise-based rehabilitation intervention for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE); (2) separately summarize the effects of exercise training in deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) survivors; and (3) identify commonly used exercise prescriptions and describe treatment progression. The Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for randomized control trials and cohort studies published prior to February 2020 comparing exercise training interventions with non-exercise interventions for patients with VTE. Two reviewers independently reviewed and appraised the risk of bias of each study. Nine articles were included for review, five of which were randomized clinical trials, while three were prospective cohort studies, and one was a retrospective cohort trial. The results showed that exercise-based rehabilitation training was safe for patients diagnosed with VTE, including patients with DVT, PE, and PTS, but offered limited evidence to support the use of regular exercise as an intervention to improve exercise capacity in patients with VTE. Exercise-based rehabilitation in VTE survivors is clearly an emerging field with a lack of large, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Existing evidence suggests that exercise is safe, but evidence to support exercise therapy as a replacement for standard care in all VTE patients is insufficient. Prescription and progression patterns should be tailored for individuals based on health conditions and functional deficits."
