        "Prosthetic prescription for lower limb amputees and the methodology used are primarily based on empirical knowledge. Clinical expertise plays an important role that can lead to an adequate prescription; however, a clear evidence based motivation for the choices made cannot be given. This can lead to local prescription variations with regard to overuse or underuse of prosthetic care and a lack of transparency for consumers and health insurance companies. Hence a clinical guideline may lead to a more consistent and efficient clinical practice and thus more uniformly high quality care. The purpose of this study was to get insight into potential similarities in prescription criteria in clinical practice in the Netherlands. Secondly, the authors were interested to know if prosthetic prescription was primarily based on the level of activity or intended use of the prosthesis. As part of the development of a consensus-based clinical guideline a multi-centred, cross-sectional study was carried out in order to observe the prosthetic prescription for a group of lower limb amputees. Therefore prescription data were collected from 151 amputees with trans-femoral amputation, knee disarticulation or trans-tibial amputation. Results of the multiple logistic regression show no relationship between the activity level and any of the variables included in the equation such as the hospital or medical doctor in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (MD in P&RM), prosthetic components, age of the amputee or reason of amputation. The criteria used are merely based on the clinical expertise and local experience whereas the actual prescriptions differ from location to location. In conclusion the development of a clinical guideline for prosthetic prescription in lower limb amputation is recommended. The information gained from this observational study will be used in a clinical guideline procedure for prosthetic prescription in the Netherlands."
