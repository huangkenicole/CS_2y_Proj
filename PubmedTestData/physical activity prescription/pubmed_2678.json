      "AbstractText": [
        "The World Health Organization has recently updated exercise guidelines for people aged >65 years, emphasizing the inclusion of multiple fitness components. However, without adequate recognition of individual differences, these guidelines may be applied using an approach that \"one-size-fits-all.\" Within the shifting paradigm toward an increasingly personalized approach to medicine and health, it is apparent that fitness components display a significant age-related increase in variability. Therefore, it is both logical and necessary to perform an accurate individualized assessment of multiple fitness components prior to optimal prescription for a personalized exercise program.",
        "The aim of the study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel tool able to remotely assess balance, flexibility, and strength using smartphone sensors (accelerometer/gyroscope), and subsequently deliver personalized exercise programs via the smartphone.",
        "We enrolled 52 healthy volunteers (34 females) aged 65+ years, with normal cognition and low fall risk. Baseline data from remote smartphone fitness assessment were analyzed to generate 42 fitness digital markers (DMs), used to guide personalized exercise programs (\u00d75/week for 6 weeks) delivered via smartphone. Programs included graded exercises for upper/lower body, flexibility, strength, and balance (dynamic, static, and vestibular). Participants were retested after 6 weeks.",
        "Average age was 74.7 \u00b1 6.4 years; adherence was 3.6 \u00b1 1.7 exercise sessions/week. Significant improvement for pre-/posttesting was observed for 10/12 DMs of strength/flexibility for upper/lower body (sit-to-stand repetitions/duration; arm-lift duration; torso rotation; and arm extension/flexion). Balance improved significantly for 6/10 measures of tandem stance, with consistent (nonsignificant) trends observed across 20 balance DMs of tandem walk and 1 leg stance. Balance tended to improve among the 37 participants exercising \u22653/week.",
        "These preliminary results provide a proof of concept, with high adherence and improved fitness confirming the benefits of remote fitness assessment for guiding home personalized exercise programs among healthy adults aged >65 years. Further examination of the application within a randomized control study is necessary, comparing the personalized exercise program to general guidelines among healthy older adults, as well as specific populations, such as those with frailty, deconditioning, cognitive, or functional impairment. The study tool offers the opportunity to collect big data, including additional variables, with subsequent utilization of artificial intelligence to optimize the personalized exercise program."
