        "Obesity is a highly prevalent condition associated with several diseases. Physical exercise has been considered as a non-pharmacological tool in the treatment of obesity. However, several aspects underlying exercise evaluation and prescription in obesity and associated pathologies are still under investigation. Although many research involving exercise have been performed in animal models, there is a lack of protocols for aerobic capacity assessment in obese animals, such as the ob/ob mice. This study aimed the following: (i) to verify the possibility of determining the lactate threshold (LT) on swimming exercise in ob/ob mice and in non-obese heterozygote mice (ob/OB), through visual inspection (vLT) and polynomial adjustment (pLT); and (ii) to verify if the LT determined through these protocols corresponds to the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS). Eight ob/ob and ten ob/OB mice performed an incremental exercise test to determine vLT and pLT as well as constant-load exercise bouts to determine MLSS. There were no within-group differences between vLT, pLT and MLSS [ob/ob: ~5.3% body weight (BW); ob/OB: ~3\u00b76%BW] with a high agreement among protocols. In conclusion, the identification of the LT and MLSS intensities was possible for both groups. These data suggest that the proposed protocols may be used in new research on the effects of different exercise intensities on some aspects of obesity."
