        "Despite international recommendations, asthma is still considered as a condition that is not perfectly managed. This was the first study performed in Togo to access asthma management among physicians.",
        "To evaluate the attitude of physicians and internes in the management of asthma in Togo. Methods Descriptive survey through auto-questionnaire conducted among physicians and internes on 1st through 31st march 2005. The studied population was 159 physicians who at least managed once an asthma patient. Computerized data were the initial complementary check up in asthma patients, the prescription habit during and between acute periods, the knowledge of the technical procedure of metered-dose inhaled devices, the using of peak-flow meter and prescription of sport. Data analysis was performed with Epi 2002 software.",
        "Participation rate was 78%. The peak-flow meter wasn't known by the investigated physicians and was prescribed by only 14.5% of them. Chest X-ray (97.5%) and hemogram (91.2%) were the most prescribed analysis. For the management of acute periods of asthma, beta 2 agonists were prescribed especially for inhaled route or for drips often combined with corticostero\u00efds. Between acute periods, aerosol of beta 2 agonists were prescribed with corticostero\u00efds (metered-dose aerosol and tablets). Dry powders were not known. Physicians in Togo forbade sport in 44%.",
