      "AbstractText": [
        "Exercise prescription has always been a mandatory yet extremely under rated non-pharmacological approach in management of diabetes mellitus. SMART acronym for S - specific, M - measurable, A - attainable, R - realistic, T - time oriented, is a newly proposed idea for implementing the same with supposedly better results. We tried to analyse the results objectively by SMART prescription of individualized exercise regimes to patients along with medicines.",
        "Single centred, prospective study conducted over a time span of 3 months, on 75 patients, with biweekly follow-up. At the end of three months, we evaluated the results (of 52 patients who remained) by comparing random blood sugar and glycosylated haemoglobin values of the patients at the beginning and end of the trial.",
        "A significant reduction in blood sugar (p-0.023) and A1C levels (p-0.105; ns) was noted after a period of three months; with an average reduction of 31mg/ dl and 0.37% noted in each respectively. Additional benefits of better follow up, reduced financial burden, increased compliance to the said regimen were observed.",
        "Recommending exercise and lifestyle changes is as important as pharmacological management in diabetes. A SMART approach, methodical prescription of the exercise routines and drugs- individualized for patients, will likely have better results and patient satisfaction. A practice of switching to precise written suggestions than verbal ideas and reviewing the progress on every follow up visit may improve the outcome."
