        "Kyprianou, E, Di Salvo, V, Lolli, L, Al Haddad, H, Villanueva, AM, Gregson, W, and Weston, M. To measure peak velocity in soccer, let the players sprint. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 273-276, 2022-Expressing externals loads relative to a player's individual capacities has potential to enhance understanding of dose-response. Peak velocity is an important metric for the individualization process and is usually measured during a sprint test. Recently, however, peak velocity was reported to be faster during soccer matches when compared with a 40-m sprint test. With the aim of developing the practice of individualized training prescription and match evaluation, we examined whether the aforementioned finding replicates in a group of elite youth soccer players across a broader range of soccer activities. To do this, we compared the peak velocities of 12 full-time male youth soccer players (age 16.3 \u00b1 0.8 years) recorded during a 40-m sprint test with peak velocity recorded during their routine activities (matches, sprints, and skill-based conditioning drills: small-sided games [SSG], medium-sided games [MSG], large-sided games [LSG]). All activities were monitored with 10-Hz global positioning systems (Catapult Optimeye S5, version 7.32) with the highest speed attained during each activity retained as the instantaneous peak velocity. Interpretation of clear between-activity differences in peak velocity was based on nonoverlap of the 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference between activities with sprint testing. Peak velocity was clearly faster for the sprint test (8.76 \u00b1 0.39 m\u00b7s-1) when compared with matches (7.94 \u00b1 0.49 m\u00b7s-1), LSG (6.94 \u00b1 0.65 m\u00b7s-1), MSG (6.40 \u00b1 0.75 m\u00b7s-1), and SSG (5.25 \u00b1 0.92 m\u00b7s-1), but not sprints (8.50 \u00b1 0.36 m\u00b7s-1). Our data show the necessity for 40-m sprint testing to determine peak velocity."
