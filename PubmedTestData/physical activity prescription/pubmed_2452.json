        "This study aimed to identify factors important to quality in exercise performance studies, specifically in the domains of aerobic, anaerobic and strength exercise. Factors related to diet and body composition were also targeted as these often influence or change with exercise.",
        "Cross-sectional study employing focus groups and a modified Delphi method.",
        "Academic staff and research students within the discipline of exercise science in a research-intensive university participated in focus groups to generate discipline-specific factors important to study quality. These factors were subsequently presented in a modified Delphi survey to a panel of international researchers with expertise in at least one of the domains. Item consensus was defined as >70% agreement on importance. The initial round contained all items generated from the focus groups. Subsequent rounds only presented items where consensus was not achieved, and additional items suggested by participants.",
        "The academic staff (n\u202f=\u202f10) and research students (n\u202f=\u202f9) generated 22 items generic to all exercise performance studies and 71 domain-specific items. Over two Delphi survey rounds involving 18 international researchers, consensus on importance was achieved for 19 generic items. Identified factors addressed exercise testing and prescription protocols, equipment and compliance to interventions. Consensus on 66 specific items was achieved but was limited by small domain-specific participant numbers (4-8).",
        "Numerous discipline-specific factors were identified as important to study quality. These factors can subsequently be used to inform the development of a tool to evaluate study quality in exercise performance research or inform best clinical practice."
