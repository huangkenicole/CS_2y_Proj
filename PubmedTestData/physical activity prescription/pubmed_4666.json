        "Sanders, D, Taylor, RJ, Myers, T, and Akubat, I. A field-based cycling test to assess predictors of endurance performance and establishing training zones. J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3482-3488, 2020-This study evaluates the relationship between a field-based 8-minute time trial (8MTT) and physiological endurance variables assessed with an incremental laboratory test. Second, lactate thresholds assessed in the laboratory were compared with estimated functional threshold power (FTP) from the 8MTT. Nineteen well-trained road cyclists (aged 22 \u00b1 2 years, height 185.9 \u00b1 4.5 cm, body mass 72.8 \u00b1 4.6 kg, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max 64 \u00b1 4 ml\u00b7min\u00b7kg) participated. Linear regression revealed that mean 8MTT power output (PO) was strongly to very strongly related to PO at 4 mmol\u00b7L, PO at initial rise of 1.00 mmol\u00b7L, PO at Dmax and modified (mDmax) (r = 0.61-0.82). Mean 8MTT PO was largely to very largely different compared with PO at fixed blood lactate concentration of 2 mmol\u00b7L (ES = 3.20) and 4 mmol\u00b7L (ES = 1.90), PO at initial rise 1.00 mmol\u00b7L (ES = 2.33), PO at Dmax (ES = 3.47) and mDmax (ES = 1.79) but only trivially different from maximal PO (Wmax) (ES = 0.09). The 8MTT based estimated FTP was moderate to very largely different compared with PO at initial rise of 1 mmol\u00b7L (ES = 1.37), PO at Dmax (ES = 2.42), PO at mDmax (ES = 0.77) and PO at 4 mmol\u00b7L (ES = 0.83). Therefore, even though the 8MTT can be valuable as a performance test in cycling shown through its relationships with predictors of endurance performance, coaches should be cautious when using FTP and PO at laboratory-based thresholds interchangeably to inform training prescription."
