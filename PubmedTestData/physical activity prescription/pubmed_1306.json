        "Extensive research has shown the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Green Prescription (GRx) but none has focused on the experiences of Pacific women who have been through the GRx programme. The research aim was to investigate the experiences of the GRx programme for Pacific women in Auckland, New Zealand.",
        "Qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 20 Pacific women aged 40 years and older, who had been members of a GRx programme in Auckland City and Counties Manukau and had been discharged as independently active.",
        "Pacific women had positive experiences of the GRx programme and identified an improvement in their physical activity, lifestyle behaviours and consequent health improvements. Positive experiences can be attributable to the social and friendly atmosphere created by their peers and staff, exercise options, and education workshop components. The social aspect of the GRx programme was the primary reason the women enjoyed and completed the programme.",
        "Pacific women reported health improvements from participation in the GRx programme. Further research is indicated to explore the health impact of the GRx for Pacific people and the benefits and acceptability of the programme for Pacific ethnic groups."
