        "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate if childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors exposed to chemotherapy (i.e., doxorubicin) are able to achieve a safe maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).",
        "A total of 250 childhood ALL survivors were eligible to undergo a CPET on ergocycle. Analyses were performed in 216 survivors and stratified in regard to their prognostic risk groups: 99 survivors (55 males and 44 females) at standard risk and 117 survivors (56 males and 61 females) at high risk.",
        "Results showed that 100% (n\u2009=\u2009216) of survivors completed a maximal CPET confirmed by the achievement of two out of three of the following criteria: 197 survivors (91.2%) reached a peak RER value of \u2265\u20091.15, 197 survivors (91.2%) reached a RPE score >\u20097, and 210 survivors (97.2%) reached a maximal heart rate \u2265\u200985% of the predicted value. Linear regression analysis showed a significant association between the survivors' cumulative dose of doxorubicin and their VO<sub>2</sub> peak measured. Two non-fatal adverse events were observed and reported at the end of the maximal CPET, while non-fatal adverse events were reported in 5 survivors during the recovery period. None of these events resulted in a long-term complication.",
        "Childhood ALL survivors with prior exposure to chemotherapy can achieve a safe maximal CPET. They were able of achieving a maximal exercise test without being limited by symptoms, potential overprotection, or musculoskeletal issues. Thus, it should be the norm to realize a CPET prior a physical activity program to propose an optimal prescription. This study provides important information regarding the maximal physiological parameters that childhood ALL survivors are able to reach and have important clinical implications in the exercise and oncology field for this population of survivors."
