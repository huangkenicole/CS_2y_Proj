        "Physical activity (PA) decreases morbidity, improves quality of life and elongates life span. PA during pregnancy is safe and decreases complications. Physical inactivity during pregnancy is an independent risk factor for maternal weight gain and complications. Pregnancy is a golden opportunity to promote a healthy lifestyle.",
        "This article aims to review the latest recommendations regarding PA in pregnancy. In this article we focused on the following: The joint guidelines of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada's (SOGC) and the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) committee opinion, and the ACSM's (American College of Sports Medicine) Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, the 11th Edition published in 2019, 2020 and 2022 respectively.",
        "PA during pregnancy is safe and essential. Every pregnant woman without contraindications should perform 150 weekly minutes of aerobic exercise and resistance training.",
        "A weekly goal of 150 medium intensity aerobic exercise minutes spread over at least 3 separate days combined with resistance training is recommended for every pregnant woman, including women who were inactive prior to the pregnancy, those diagnosed with gestational diabetes and overweight or obese women. Pregnant women with absolute contraindication can continue to perform their daily activities but avoid more intense activities, those with relative contraindications should discuss the advantages and risks of PA with their attending physician. After birth, women can return to PA gradually depending on the mode of delivery and complications encountered."
