        "To analyze the perceptions of Spanish rheumatologists, experts in spondyloarthropathies (SpA), on the role of exercise in these and in other rheumatic diseases",
        "A survey to 106 rheumatologists belonging to an SpA working group of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology, GRESSER, was collected. The questions were related with general aspects of professional exercise (clinical practice and generic knowledge), use of fitness in SpA (benefits, indications, contraindications, compliance, facilitators), sociodemographic characteristics and professional experience with the respondents' exercise regimen. A descriptive analysis was performed.",
        "the survey was sent to 106 rheumatologists, 44 of them answered (51% female, over 20 years of experience). Over 86% believe that their patients need exercise, but the prescription is moderate. 42% believe they do not have training to prescribe specific exercises. The physical activity education materials available consisted essentially of brochures (90%), websites (52%) and videos (23%). The therapeutic importance of exercise depends on the type of underlying disease. Most agree in decreasing the intensity of exercise during disease flares. For most cases of Spa, exercise is not a trigger of flares (66%), and may be used at any stage of the disease, depending on the type and the phase of the Spa.",
        "Rheumatologists consider exercise as a fundamental part of the treatment of rheumatic patients, but greater knowledge and development of specific strategies in its prescription is required."
