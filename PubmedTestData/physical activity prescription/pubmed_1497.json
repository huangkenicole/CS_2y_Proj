        "The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of intensity on rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during a multiple-set resistance exercise session. Fourteen men (22.9 \u00b1 3.8 years) with previous experience in resistance training (22.9 \u00b1 3.8 years) performed 2 experimental sessions in random order: resistance exercise at 50% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (E50%) and resistance exercise at 70% of 1RM (E70%). In both sessions, 5 exercises (bench press, bent-over row, frontal raises, arm curl, and overhead triceps extension) were performed in 3 sets of 12, 9, and 6 repetitions, respectively. Active muscle RPEs were measured after each repetition using the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale (OMNI-RES). In the 3 sets of 5 exercises, the RPE was higher at E70% than that at E50%. The differences in RPE between intensities were observed in both the first and the sixth repetitions for each exercise. In the E70% session, the RPE increased between sets in all exercises, whereas it did not change in the E50% session. In conclusion, the RPE was higher at 70% of 1RM than that at 50% of 1RM. Moreover, in a multiple-set prescription, the RPE did not change between sets with 50% of 1RM, whereas the RPE increased between sets with 70% of 1RM. These findings suggest that RPE can be effectively used to prescribe and monitor resistance exercise intensity during an entire multiple-set exercise session in young men with previous experience in resistance training."
