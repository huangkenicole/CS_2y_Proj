        "Physical fitness was studied in patients with chronic pulmonary emphysema using Kraus-Weber methods in addition to pulmonary function and exercise tolerance. In Kraus-Weber tests, explosive strength of abdominal muscles in these patients were within the normal range, but both abdominal and back muscle endurance were significantly diminished compared to age-matched controls. On the other hand, flexibility was not different between the patients and the controls, although large variation was present. Exercise performance as assessed by 6 minutes' walk distance in patients was significantly correlated with FEV1.0, DLco and maximal inspiratory mouth pressure, as well as explosive strength of abdominal muscles and abdominal and back muscle endurance capacity. Treadmill walking training for 20 minutes with a load greater than 80% VO2max, twice a week for 2 months was performed in 11 patients with mild to moderate pulmonary emphysema. Six minutes' walk distance (6MD) was significantly prolonged with improvement of back muscle endurance and flexibility. Another walking training consisting of five repetitions of two minutes' near maximal walking and a two minute interval of rest was performed in 6 patients with severe pulmonary emphysema. 6MD tended to increase with improvement of both back and abdominal muscle endurance. However, pulmonary function tests and VO2max showed no significant changes after both types of training. Improved walked distance after the training was significantly correlated with improved VO2 at AT. Furthermore VO2, VE, HR and lactate production during exercise at the same load were significantly decreased compared to pre-training. Dyspnea sensation measured by modified Borg scale during exercise was improved after the training. It is concluded that a physical training program adapted to the condition of the individual patients could improve exercise performance, and should be prescribed in addition to medication."
