        "Diminished cerebrovascular function is associated with reduced cognitive ability. Habitual exercise may maintain or improve cerebrovascular function; however, limited information exists regarding the optimal exercise prescription for cerebrovascular health. Although aerobic exercise is associated with improved systemic vascular function, the influence of resistance exercise on vascular health is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of habitual exercise training on cerebrovascular function in healthy young adults. We evaluated 13 untrained (age\u2009=\u200927\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009yr; 11 men, 2 women), 13 aerobic-trained (age\u2009=\u200928\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009yr; 10 men, 3 women), and 13 resistance-trained (age\u2009=\u200924\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009yr; 11 men, 2 women) adults. Middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and end-tidal carbon dioxide were continuously measured at rest and in response to hypercapnia. At rest, there were no differences between groups for MCAv, however, resistance-trained adults had greater cerebrovascular conductance compared with aerobic-trained adults (0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u2009cm/s/mmHg vs. 0.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17\u2009cm/s/mmHg; <i>P</i> < 0.05). In response to hypercapnia, cerebrovascular reactivity and MAP reactivity were not different between groups. There was no association between aerobic fitness or measures of exercise volume and any variable of cerebrovascular function in the combined or individual groups. Our results suggest that the mode of exercise training does not impact cerebrovascular reactivity in healthy young adults, however, it may influence resting cerebral hemodynamics. Future research could examine the influence of habitual exercise training on cerebrovascular function with aging.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Habitual exercise may influence cerebral hemodynamics, as it affects other variables of vascular health in this population. We report that habitual exercise training does not influence cerebrovascular reactivity in young adults, as there were no significant differences between aerobic-trained, resistance-trained, and untrained individuals. Despite this finding, the mode of habitual exercise training had a moderate influence on resting cerebral hemodynamics such that resistance-trained adults had greater cerebrovascular conductance compared with aerobic-trained adults."
