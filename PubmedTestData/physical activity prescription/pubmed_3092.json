        "Currently, there are no clear guidelines for the implementation of rehabilitative exercise training (RET) in burned individuals. Therefore, we quantified the training logs for exercise intensity, frequency, and duration of 6 weeks of this program to develop a basic framework for outpatient RET in patients recovering from severe burns. Thirty-three children (11 female, [mean \u00b1 SD] 12 \u00b1 3 years, 145 \u00b1 18 cm, 40 \u00b1 11 kg, 49 \u00b1 31 BMI percentile) with severe burns (49 \u00b1 15% total body surface area burned, with 35 \u00b1 22% third-degree burns) completed our 6-week resistance and aerobic exercise training program. Cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2), strength, power, and lean body mass (LBM) were measured before and after RET. Outcome measures were analyzed as a relative percentage of values in age- and sex-matched nonburned children (11 female, 12 \u00b1 3 years, 154 \u00b1 20 cm, 49 \u00b1 22 kg, 56 \u00b1 25 BMI percentile). At discharge, burned children had lower LBM (77% of age-sex-matched nonburn values), peak torque (53%), power (62%), and cardiorespiratory fitness (56%). After 6 weeks of training, LBM increased by 5% (82% of nonburn values), peak torque by 18% (71%), power by 20% (81%), and cardiorespiratory fitness by 18% (74%; P < .0001 for all). Quantification of data in exercise training logs suggested that physical capacity can be improved by aerobic exercise training performed at five metabolic equivalents (>70% of peak VO2) at least 3 days/week and 150 minutes/week and by resistance training performed at volume loads (reps \u00d7 sets \u00d7 weight) of 131 kg for the upper body and 275 kg for the lower body for 2 days/week. We present for the first time the quantification of our RET and provide clear exercise prescription guidelines specific to children with severe burn injury."
