        "Bodyweight-supporting treadmills are popular rehabilitation tools for athletes recovering from impact-related injuries because they reduce ground reaction forces during running. However, the overall metabolic demand of a given running speed is also reduced, meaning athletes who return to competition after using such a device in rehabilitation may not be as fit as they had been prior to their injury.",
        "To explore the metabolic effects of adding incline during bodyweight-supported treadmill running.",
        "Cross-sectional.",
        "Research laboratory.",
        "Fourteen apparently healthy, recreational runners (6 females and 8 males; 21 [3]\u00a0y, 1.71 [0.08]\u00a0m, 63.11 [6.86]\u00a0kg).",
        "The participants performed steady-state running trials on a bodyweight-supporting treadmill at 8.5\u00a0mph. The control condition was no incline and no bodyweight support. All experimental conditions were at 30% bodyweight support. The participants began the sequence of experimental conditions at 0% incline; this increased to 1%, and from there on, 2% incline increases were introduced until a 15% grade was reached. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare all bodyweight-support conditions against the control condition.",
        "Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion.",
        "Level running with 30% bodyweight support reduced oxygen consumption by 21.6% (P < .001) and heart rate by 12.0% (P < .001) compared with the control. Each 2% increase in incline with bodyweight support increased oxygen consumption by 6.4% and heart rate by 3.2% on average. A 7% incline elicited similar physiological measures as the unsupported, level condition. However, the perceived intensity of this incline with bodyweight support was greater than the unsupported condition (P < .001).",
        "Athletes can maintain training intensity while running on a bodyweight-supporting treadmill by introducing incline. Rehabilitation programs should rely on quantitative rather than qualitative data to drive exercise prescription in this modality."
