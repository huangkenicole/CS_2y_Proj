        "Katsoulis, K and Amara, CE. The effects of power training frequency on muscle power and functional performance in older women: a randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 37(11): 2289-2297, 2023-Low-intensity power training (PT) has emerged as an effective method for improving muscle power and functional performance in older adults. However, effects of low training frequencies are less understood and could expand the repertoire of exercise prescription, particularly in older women who experience greater functional disability with age compared with men. This study investigated the impact of frequency of low-intensity (40% of 1 repetition maximum, 1RM) PT on lower-body power and functional performance in healthy older women. Women (74 \u00b1 4 years) were randomized to 12 weeks of PT of 1 (PT1, n = 14), 2 (PT2, n = 17), or 3 (PT3, n = 17) d\u00b7wk -1 or wait control (CON, n = 15). Measures included leg press 1RM, knee extension power (KEP), and functional performance (stair climb power, stair climb time, 30-second chair stands, 400-m walk, Short Physical Performance Battery). There were no differences between the frequency of training in changes in leg press 1RM, KEP, or functional performance after 12 weeks. Pre-post data for individual training groups revealed that leg press 1RM improved in all PT groups (20-33%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, KEP improved in PT2 and PT3 by 10 and 12%, respectively, and all PT groups improved in the 30-second chair stands and Short Physical Performance Battery (6-22%), whereas PT1 and PT3 improved in the 400-m walk and PT2 improved in stair climb power and stair climb time after training (4-7%, p < 0.05). One to 3 weekly low-intensity PT sessions can improve functional performance, although improvements in both functional performance and power might require 2 or 3 sessions per week in older healthy women."
