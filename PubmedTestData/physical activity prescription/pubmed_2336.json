        "<b>Introduction:</b> The Heart Rate Performance Curve (HRPC) is neither linear nor uniform and related to \u00df1-adrenoceptor sensitivity. As aging and exercise influence \u00df1-adrenoceptors we suggested age, sex and performance effects on the HRPC. Aim of the study was to examine the effects of aging on the deflection of the HRPC in maximal incremental cycle ergometer exercise (CE) in a large cohort of healthy subjects. <b>Methods:</b> Heart rate (HR) data of 2,980 men (51 \u00b1 15 years) and 1,944 women (52 \u00b1 14 years) were classified into age groups (\u226420 up to >80 years). We analyzed age and performance (P<sub>low</sub> 25%-quartile and P<sub>high</sub> 75%-quartile of age predicted power) effects on HR<sub>max</sub> and on the degree (<i>k</i>) and the type (regular downward deflection <i>k</i> > 0.1, linear -0.1 \u2264 <i>k</i> \u2264 0.1 and atypical upward deflection <i>k</i> < -0.1) of the HRPC. <b>Results:</b><i>k</i>-values decreased significantly with age in men and women and were significantly higher in women. Atypical HRPC's increased by a linear trend from \u226420 to 70 years (<i>m</i>) respectively 80 years (<i>w</i>) from 10 to 43% (<i>m</i>) and 9 to 30% (<i>w</i>). HR<sub>max</sub> of all age groups was lower in P<sub>low</sub> and overall number of atypical HRPC's was 21% (<i>m</i>) and 16% (<i>w</i>) higher compared to P<sub>high</sub>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Aging increased the number of atypical HRPC's with upward deflection in CE tests, which influences exercise intensity prescription especially when using fixed percentages of HR<sub>max</sub>. Changes in HRPC's were affected by sex and performance, where women generally and subjects with higher performance presented less atypical HRPC's even at older age."
