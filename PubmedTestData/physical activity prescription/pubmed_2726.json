        "Multipronged exercise interventions comprising aerobic, resistance and corrective therapeutic components were shown to result in endurance and strength improvement and reduction of fatigue and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Telerehabilitation systems may have significant potential in improving patient access to multipronged exercise, however it is not clear whether PwMS can successfully use a multipronged exercise system at home without assistance. The goal of this project was to assess usability and acceptance of a multipronged exercise system in PwMS. Usability assessment was based on evaluation of patient ability to successfully carry out a standardized list of common tasks necessary to operate the system. For each task, time to completion, perceived difficulty and satisfaction were documented. Our results indicated high level of acceptance of the system by these patients. On average, it took about 1-2 minutes for the patients to complete the study tasks essential for the system operation. They were able to successfully use the system and follow their individualized exercise prescription. The resulting system is warranted for a definitive systematic evaluation in a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate its clinical impact in PwMS."
