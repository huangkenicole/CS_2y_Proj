        "Community-based exercise is a continuation and complement to inpatient rehabilitation for Parkinson's disease and does not require a professional physical therapist or equipment. The effects, parameters, and forms of each exercise are diverse, and the effect is affected by many factors. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect and the best parameters for improving motor symptoms and to explore the possible factors affecting the effect of community-based exercise.\u00a0 METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of six databases: PEDro, PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and WOS. Studies that compared community-based exercise with usual care were included. The intervention mainly included dance, Chinese martial arts, Nordic walking, and home-based exercise. The primary outcome measure was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score. The mean difference (95% CI) was used to calculate the treatment outcomes of continuous outcome variables, and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic was used to estimate the heterogeneity of the statistical analysis. We conducted subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to determine the optimal parameters and the most important influencing factors of the exercise effect.\u00a0 RESULTS: Twenty-two studies that enrolled a total of 809 subjects were included in the analysis. Exercise had a positive effect on the UPDRS-III (MD\u2009=\u2009-5.83; 95% CI, -8.29 to -3.37), Timed Up and Go test (MD\u2009=\u2009-2.22; 95% CI -3.02 to -1.42), UPDRS ((MD\u2009=\u2009-7.80; 95% CI -10.98 to -6.42), 6-Minute Walk Test (MD\u2009=\u200968.81; 95% CI, 32.14 to 105.48), and Berg Balance Scale (MD\u2009=\u20094.52; 95% CI, 2.72 to 5.78) scores. However, the heterogeneity of each included study was obvious. Weekly frequency, age, and duration of treatment were all factors that potentially influenced the effect.",
        "This meta-analysis suggests that community-based exercise may benefit motor function in patients with PD. The most commonly used modalities of exercise were tango and tai chi, and the most common prescription was 60\u00a0min twice a week. Future studies should consider the influence of age, duration of treatment, and weekly frequency on the effect of exercise.",
