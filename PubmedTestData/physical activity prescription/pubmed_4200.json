        "Spiroergometrical testing with the load graded upto symptom-limited maximum with the determination of anaerobic threshold begins to be a routine method in exercise testing of cardiac patients. Functional parameters according to available data depend on the source of load and may be influenced by the protocol of testing, too. That is why we decided to compare two protocols used in chronic heart failure patients exercise testing. 11 male and 3 female patients (NYHA II, III) suffering from chronic heart failure were subjected to the symptom-limited tests (protocol A-0.25 W.kg (-1/3 minutes with one minute breaks; protocol B-25 W + 10 W/2 minutes). There was no statistically significant differences in the symptom-limited values of main functional parameters. The AT level parameters did not differ significantly, as well. Anaerobic threshold could be determined in all patients using the protocol A and in 11 cases using the protocol B. The difference in rates was not statistically significant. The workload duration using the protocol B was significantly shorter (9.7 +/- 3.8 minutes vs. 16.4 +/- 3.6 minutes).",
        "Protocol B is less time demanding and therefore it is more suitable for determination of the symptom-limited parameters in the clinical routine. Anaerobic threshold can be determined by protocol A more often than by protocol B. Therefore, protocol A appears to be more suitable for the individual prescription of the appropriate physical activity and for scientific purposes, too."
