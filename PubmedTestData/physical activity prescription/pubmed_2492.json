        "Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is a side effect of cancer treatment and can be alleviated by resistance exercise. This systematic, evidence-based review examined the existing best evidence on resistance exercise for BCRL to accurately describe the current status of the field and offer recommendations for clinicians.",
        "This review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. Clinical practice guidelines, consensus documents, systematic reviews and other related evidence-based resources about resistance exercise for BCRL were retrieved through the English databases and guideline websites. The publication data limit was set to December 2020. The following search terms were used: 'breast cancer/breast neoplasm/breast carcinoma/breast tumor/breast malignancy, lymphedema/swelling/edema/lymphoedema, resistance/weight/strength training, best practice/clinical practice/guideline/consensus documents'. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by two authors independently using AGREE II and AMSTAR II tools. Evidence-based recommendations on resistance exercise relevant for BCRL were synthesised and categorised.",
        "Twenty two articles (seven guidelines, four consensus documents and eleven systematic reviews) were included. The overall quality of the eleven eligible guidelines and consensus documents was moderate to high according to the AGREE II criteria. The quality of the eleven systematic reviews was critically low to high according to the AMSTAR criteria. Six clinical topics involving 43 recommendations were identified. Recommendations were categorised by safety of resistance training, effectiveness of resistance training, evaluation prior to resistance exercise, resistance exercise prescription, resistance training outcome index and points for attention.",
        "This study summarises 43 recommendations for resistance training for BCRL and provides guidance for clinicians. Based on randomised trials and systematic reviews published in recent years, there is an urgent need to update the guidelines and consensus documents in terms of topics, for example effectiveness of resistance training and resistance training outcome index."
