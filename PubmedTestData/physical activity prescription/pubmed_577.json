        "Accurate quantification and monitoring of exercise \"dose\", described by oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), is necessary for exercise prescription and individualization. However, due to the complexity and elevated cost of direct, gold-standard methods, this is rarely done outside research laboratories. Heart rate-index (HR<sub>index</sub>) is a new simple method to estimate VO<sub>2</sub> in healthy and clinical populations. We tested the performance of HR<sub>index</sub> to estimate VO<sub>2</sub> in diabetic patients during aerobic (AT) and isotonic training (IT).",
        "Data from 12 males (age: 64\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0years; BMI: 26\u2009\u00b1\u200912) with type 2 diabetes were analysed. VO<sub>2</sub> and heart rate were measured during one AT and one IT session. Furthermore, VO<sub>2</sub> was indirectly estimated based on HR<sub>index</sub>. Then, the correspondence between measured and estimated VO<sub>2</sub> was evaluated by two-way RM-ANOVA, correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.",
        "Estimated average VO<sub>2</sub> values during AT (1292\u2009\u00b1\u2009366\u00a0ml/min) were not different from (p\u2009=\u20090.243) and highly correlated with (r\u2009=\u20090.87, p\u2009<\u20090.001) the measured values (1369\u2009\u00b1\u2009417\u00a0ml/min), with a small bias and imprecision. Conversely during IT, HR<sub>index</sub> overestimated VO<sub>2</sub> compared to the actual measures (1048\u2009\u00b1\u2009404 vs 667\u2009\u00b1\u2009230\u00a0ml/min, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) and only a moderate correlation was found between values (r\u2009=\u20090.43, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), with a large bias and imprecision.",
        "VO<sub>2</sub> of aerobic exercises can be accurately estimated in diabetes patients using HR<sub>index</sub>. During isotonic exercise, this method is not recommended for monitoring metabolic intensity due to large overestimation and imprecision. In aerobic exercise, HR<sub>index</sub> offers a simple and valid alternative to the direct VO<sub>2</sub> determination and may favour the applicability of time-resolved measures of exercise \"dose\"."
