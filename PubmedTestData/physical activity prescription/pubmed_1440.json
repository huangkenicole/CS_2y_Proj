      "AbstractText": [
        "Implementation of lifestyle modification (LM), a cornerstone of hypertension control has been reported to be more challenging than pharmacotherapy. We studied the LM prescription patterns of general medical practitioners (GPs) in Lagos, Nigeria for blood pressure control.",
        "GPs were assessed using anonymous self-administered questionnaire on the prescription of salt restriction, weight management, cessation of tobacco use, physical exercise, and consumption of DASH-like diet for blood pressure control. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student t-test were used to test for differences as appropriate. Logistic regression model was constructed to identify the determinants of adequate LM prescription.",
        "A total of 213 GPs (38% females) participated in the survey. LM prescription was over 90% for the following: salt restriction (96.7%), tobacco cessation (94.8%), weight management (94.4%). The remaining were 81.2% and 75.1% for healthy diet and physical activity respectively. The median LM prescription score (of the GPs) was 18.0 [15.0-50.0]. The single significant predictor of adequate LM prescription was total patient load of the GPs (AOR:0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, p=0.006). Eleven (5.2%), 190 (89.2%), and 12 (5.6%) GPs initiated LM prescription at blood pressure values >140/90mmHg, =140/90mmHg and <140/90mmHg respectively. LM initiation at BP <140/90mmHg was associated with female gender, shorter work experience, working in tertiary care facility and ignorance about hypertension prevention (p<0.05).",
        "LM is widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, but rarely prescribed for its prevention in Nigeria. Interventions to reduce physician's patient load may engender improved LM prescription."
