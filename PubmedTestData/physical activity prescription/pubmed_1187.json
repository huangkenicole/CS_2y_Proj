        "Exercise rehabilitation training is an important measure for improving the prognosis of patients with hip fractures. However, the particular program that works effectively and the efficiency of exercise therapy are still controversial.",
        "To compare the effects of usual postoperative care combined with rehabilitation based on exercise prescription on motor function and complications in elderly patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture.",
        "This was an observational study. A total of 71 elderly patients with hip fractures who were treated with hip arthroplasty and internal fixation of the proximal femur with an intramedullary nail at Suzhou Municipal Hospital from October 2020 to December 2021 were included; 11 cases were excluded (eight cases were excluded due to loss of follow-up, two due to deaths from other causes, and one due to other reasons). Finally, 60 patients (18 males and 42 females) were included. Patients were randomly assigned to the control (n\u2009=\u200930) and experimental (n\u2009=\u200930) groups using a random number generator. Patients in the control group received usual postoperative care, whereas those in the experimental group received usual postoperative care combined with rehabilitation training based on the principles of exercise prescription. We recorded the motor function (Harris hip score), daily living ability (Barthel Index), and complications at discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively for statistical analysis.",
        "The Harris hip score and Barthel Index score were significantly higher at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively than at discharge in both groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The Harris hip score and Barthel Index score at discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The incidence of complications at 6 months postoperatively was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (13% vs. 37%).",
        "Rehabilitation therapy based on exercise prescription helps improve hip function and the ability to perform activities of daily living and related postoperative complications after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. The findings of our study will guide decision-making in clinical practice and improve the clinical management of hip fractures in elderly patients postoperatively."
