        "Physical activity (PA) has been shown to improve patient-centered care for cancer-related symptoms, treatment-related side effects, and health-related quality of life.",
        "This feasibility study aimed to explore PA preferences and changes in functional capacity and symptoms during a two-week self-prescribed PA intervention prior to treatment in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.",
        "Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer were recruited from a community hospital, part of an academic comprehensive cancer center in the southeastern United States. An individualized PA intervention prescription was developed using baseline measures. Baseline and two-week measures consisted of functional capacity, PA participation, and symptom impact. Descriptive statistics and t tests were used.",
        "Thirteen men aged an average of 66.14 years (SD = 6.82) participated. Participants significantly improved functional capacity. Most common PAs were walking (n = 9) and yard work (n = 6)."
