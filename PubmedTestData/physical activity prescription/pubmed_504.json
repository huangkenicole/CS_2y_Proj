        "Physical inactivity is common among older populations and American Indians. Our objective was to compare two methods for increasing physical activity and walking among American Indian elders.",
        "We conducted a two arm randomized trial to increase physical activity in 125 American Indians aged 50-74 years at the Seattle Indian Health Board in 2005. Participants were randomized into either an activity monitoring (N=63) or activity monitoring with a pedometer (N=62) arm over a six-week period. Outcomes included self-reported physical activity and well-being, and the 6-min walk test.",
        "There were no group differences in self-reported physical activities and well-being. The 6-min walk test yielded no between-group differences. All participants increased the frequency of leisure walking (p<0.01), frequency of all exercise-related activities (p<0.01), frequency of moderate-intensity exercise activities (p<0.01), and improved weekly caloric expenditure for all exercise activities (p<0.05) by the end of the trial.",
        "Pedometers did not confer enhanced performance on the physical activity outcomes beyond those achieved through self-monitoring. Physical activity can be promoted among at-risk groups in a brief, inexpensive manner in primary care. Exercise prescription and culturally relevant enhancement strategies may optimize physical activity outcomes for elder American Indians."
