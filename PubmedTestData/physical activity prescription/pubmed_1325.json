        "Physical activity (PA) is important for the prevention and treatment of numerous chronic medical conditions. Individuals with a limb amputation face unique challenges for staying physically active. There are few studies evaluating PA of civilians with amputation in the United States.",
        "To evaluate self-reported PA in persons with an amputation in the outpatient setting using a standardized exercise vital sign (EVS) and correlate PA with demographic information, amputation characteristics, and disease burden.",
        "Cross-sectional observational study.",
        "Outpatient rehabilitation clinic at a tertiary care institution.",
        "N/A.",
        "Two hundred twenty-nine patients with limb amputation.",
        "EVS (self-reported weekly participation in moderate to vigorous intensity exercise), disease burden using a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), possession of a prosthetic limb, amputation level, time from amputation, body mass index (BMI), gender, race, and age.",
        "A total of 28.8% of patients with limb amputation self-reported exercising at or above 150\u2009min/wk as recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); 31.8% of patients with transfemoral amputations, 27.8% with transtibial amputations, and 36% with upper extremity amputations reported exercising the recommended amount. Those with a prosthesis exercised 0.91\u2009h/wk more than those without a prosthesis (95% CI 0.01, 1.8, P\u2009=\u2009.047), and female patients exercised 1.09\u2009h/wk less than male patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-0.49, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Increasing age (P\u2009=\u2009.045), CCI (P\u2009=\u2009.006), and BMI (P\u2009=\u2009.005) all had a small but significant correlation with lower EVS. There was no statistically significant correlation between EVS and amputation level, race, or time from amputation.",
        "Less than one-third of patients with an amputation meet HHS recommendations for aerobic exercise. Male patients, those with a prosthesis, lower CCI, lower BMI, and younger age reported higher PA rates. Assessing EVS can help clinicians to identify patients with amputation that are not sufficiently active and may benefit from PA counseling and prescription."
