        "The prescription of home oxygen cylinders is substantial. This study aimed to establish patient's current use of short burst oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to examine potential cost savings if cylinder use had been replaced by a concentrator. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was completed by 100 patients currently receiving short burst oxygen therapy. Patients reported that they used their oxygen before exercise/activity (26%), during exercise (19%), after exercise/activity (87%) and at rest (46%) and mostly for the relief of symptomatic breathlessness. The length of time [mean (SD)] patients had oxygen at home was 27.42 (29.31) months. Of those patients using cylinders, savings could have been made by transferring from cylinders to concentrators. While withdrawal of oxygen may be difficult, an oxygen assessment service could ensure that future prescription is aimed at those who benefit and is delivered by the most cost-effective method."
