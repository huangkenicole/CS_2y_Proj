        "Obesity affects 600 million people globally and increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Bariatric surgery is an increasingly popular therapeutic intervention for morbid obesity to induce rapid weight loss and reduce obesity-related comorbidities. However, some bariatric surgery patients, after what is considered a successful surgical procedure, continue to manifest obesity-related health issues, including weight gain, reduced physical function, persistent elevations in blood pressure, and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of mortality and several health outcomes and could be improved by an appropriate exercise prescription after bariatric surgery. This review provides a broad overview of exercise training for patients after bariatric surgery and discusses cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential physiological adaptations in response to exercise training."
