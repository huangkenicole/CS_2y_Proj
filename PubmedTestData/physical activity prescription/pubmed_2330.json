      "AbstractText": [
        "Clinical exercise physiologists (CEPs) specialize in managing long-term, non-communicable health conditions using scientific rehabilitative exercise prescription, which alleviates the burden of these conditions on health care systems. This is evident, particularly in Australia (AUS), where they are registered as health care workers. CEPs have been shown to reduce the physical burden of long-term conditions on populations and the economic load that these place on national health departments. This article aims to evidence the effectiveness of CEPs in Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) rehabilitation, the cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise prescription for various NCDs by CEPs in AUS, and related cost-effectiveness New Zealand (NZ) burden of disease. This article highlights the important role NZ. CEPs can play in reducing chronic disease cost if given the same opportunities as Australian CEPs within NZ's health care system."
