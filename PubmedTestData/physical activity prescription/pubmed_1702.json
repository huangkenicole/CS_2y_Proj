        "The study aimed to investigate the differences in oxygen uptake ((Equation is included in full-text article.)O2) and heart rate (HR) (at rest, submaximal exercise, peak exercise, and recovery) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with \u03b2-blockers (BB) or without BB treatment (NBB) and to analyze the relationship between HR reserve (HRresv) and peak (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2 ((Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak) in BB and NBB.",
        "A total of 174 HFpEF patients (>65 yr; BB, n = 59; NBB, n = 115) were assessed with a cardiopulmonary exercise test to peak exertion using an incremental protocol. After 5 min of supine rest, HR and (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2 (HRrest, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2rest) at submaximal exercise (HRsubmax, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2submax), at peak exercise (HRpeak, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak), at 1 min of passive recovery (HRrec1), HRresv (HRpeak- HRrest), and HR recovery (HRrecov = HRpeak- HRrec1) were evaluated.",
        "Analysis showed that HRrest (66.0 \u00b1 12.2 vs 69.7 \u00b1 10.6 bpm), HRsubmax (91.7 \u00b1 16.2 vs 98.6 \u00b1 15.2 bpm), and HRrec1 (102.9 \u00b1 18.9 vs 109.4 \u00b1 16.9 bpm) were significantly lower (P \u2264 .05) in BB than in NBB, respectively. However, there were no significant differences (P > .05) between the BB and the NBB for HRpeak, HRresv, HRrecov, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2rest, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2submax, and (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak. A significant relationship was found between HRresv and (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak values in both groups (BB, r = 0.52; NBB, r = 0.49, P < .001).",
        "The nonsignificant differences in HRpeak, HRresv, HRrecov, or (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2 values between BB and NBB HFpEF patients, along with significant correlation between HRresv and (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak, suggest that these measures may have equal utility in prognostic and functional assessment as well as clinical applications, including the prescription of exercise, in elderly HFpEF patients."
