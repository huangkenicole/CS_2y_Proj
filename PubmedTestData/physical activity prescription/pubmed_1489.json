        "Strong primary care is in urgent need for the management and control of hypertension. This study aimed to compare the quality of hypertensive care delivered by community health centers (CHCs) in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Multistage random sampling method was used to select 4 CHCs in each city as study settings. A cohort of hypertensive patients under the hypertensive management program in the CHCs was selected from the electronic information system by using a systematic random sampling method. Binary logistic regression models were constructed for comparison between the 2 cities. A total of 3196 patients' records were assessed. The proportions of hypertensive patients who received advice on smoking cessation (33.8 vs 7.7%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), increasing physical activity (52.4 vs 16.8%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), low-sodium diet (72.0 vs 64.1%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001), and regular follow-up (37.8 vs 8.6%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) were higher in Shenzhen than in Shanghai. However, the drug treatment rate in Shenzhen was lower than that in Shanghai (74.2 vs 95.2%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The hypertension control rate in Shenzhen was lower than that in Shanghai (76.3 vs 83.2%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Better performance in the process of hypertensive care in terms of increasing physical activity advice, low-sodium diet advice, regular follow-up, and drug prescription was associated with a higher rate of hypertension control. The study indicates that primary care is effective in managing hypertension irrespective of management and operation models of CHCs in urban China. Our study suggests that improvements in the process of hypertensive care may lead to better hypertension control."
