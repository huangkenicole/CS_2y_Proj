        "The purpose of this study is to establish evidence of validity for wearable activity monitors providing real-time cadence against a criterion measure. Thirty-six healthy adults, aged 18-65 years, participated in the study. Four activity monitors including 2 watch-based monitors and 2 cadence sensors attaching to shoelaces were tested. Each participant completed the study protocol consisting of 2 distinct components: (1) treadmill protocol and (2) overground protocol. Lin's concordance correlation and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were calculated for the comparisons between the criterion and measures of the monitors. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the mean bias and 95% limits of agreement. All activity monitors showed high correlations with the criterion measures (p < .01). Lower correlations were observed at slow walking speeds in the watch-based monitors. In contrast, consistent and strong correlations were found with both cadence sensors regardless of walking speeds (p < .01). Similar patterns were observed in the MAPE scores. Greater than 90% of the participants were able to maintain prescribed walking intensity using real-time cadence. The results suggest that the wearable activity monitors are an acceptable measure of real-time cadence and provide the potential to improve intensity-based prescription of physical activity using the monitors."
