        "Emerging evidence supports exercise as a therapeutic intervention for patients with bone metastases. However, exercise prescription in practice is limited by concerns regarding skeletal-related events (SREs). This study examined associations among habitual physical activity levels, history of SREs, and patient reported outcomes in patients with bone metastases.",
        "A total of 58 patients with bone metastases (n\u202f=\u202f45 breast cancer; n\u202f=\u202f13 prostate cancer; mean time since cancer diagnosis 5.8 [4.7] years) were assessed. Habitual physical activity levels were collected by accelerometry. Standardized subjective assessment collected history of SREs, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BM22), pain (Brief Pain Inventory), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire), and perceptions about exercise (Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale). Participants spent a mean of 77.37% (standard deviation 14.3)% of waking hours sedentary and a mean of 20.14% (standard deviation 13.4)% of waking hours in light intensity activity. Almost half (n\u202f=\u202f28) completed \u2265150 min/wk moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity were associated with lower pain scores, better perceived physical function, lower functional interference scores, and better quality of life. Patients with a history of fracture since diagnosis spent more time sedentary and in light intensity activity in comparison to those with no fracture history (P < .05).",
        "Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity may have multiple benefits for patients with bone metastases. Reducing sedentary behavior may be a key target for patients with a history of fracture.",
        "Oncology nurses play a key role in providing education on the benefits of exercise, overcoming barriers to physical activity and timely referrals."
