        "Despite the benefits of physical activity (PA), especially related to aging, physical therapists do not perform regular PA prescriptions secondary to various barriers, including lack of tools. Therefore, we developed the Inventory of Physical Activity Barriers (IPAB).",
        "Explore potential solutions that could address the current lack of PA prescription among United States-based physical therapists treating patients 50\u00a0years and older.",
        "A convergent parallel mixed-method design consisting of focus groups and self-report questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used for all quantitative variables. Focus groups were thematically coded.",
        "The 26 participants had 8.6\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a06.4) of clinical experience, 88.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a023) reported they regularly have PA conversations with patients, 65.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a017) regularly assess PA levels, and 19.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a05) regularly provide PA prescriptions. We identified three themes: 1) opportunities and challenges related to PA prescriptions; 2) lack of standardization in PA assessments and interventions; and 3) implementation potential for innovative solutions that address the current informal PA assessments and interventions.",
        "Physical therapists are amenable to incorporating innovative solutions that support physical activity prescription behavior. Therefore, we recommend the continued development and implementation of PA assessment and prescription tools."
