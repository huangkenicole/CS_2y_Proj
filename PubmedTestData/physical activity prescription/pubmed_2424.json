        "Exercise is an increasingly widely used treatment for older people across a range of clinical conditions including sarcopenia and physical frailty. Whilst exercise can have many benefits for older people, adaptations to exercise are specific to the exercise mode that is performed and not all exercise is created equal. The correct type of exercise, at the correct dose, needs to be prescribed to maximise effectiveness in treating sarcopenia and physical frailty where maintaining or improving muscle strength and physical function represent key aims. Resistance exercise (RE) is the most potent approach to improving muscle strength and physical function and should be prioritised within exercise programmes delivered to this group. Resistance exercise programme design should be underpinned by the fundamental principles of exercise prescription in order to deliver an appropriate and individualised exercise dose to maximise the potential of RE as a treatment for older people living with sarcopenia and physical frailty."
