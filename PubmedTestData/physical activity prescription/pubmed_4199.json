        "The clinical efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation programs is clearly recognized. Yet, as regards the three main currently employed strategies (exercise, education, and psychobehavioral support), new ideas regularly appear, stemming from studies aimed at providing proof of their efficacy and innocuousness, along with optimal modes of prescription and, at times, their cost-benefit ratio. This ongoing work, which was initially developed in view of enriching the \"What's new in?\" section of the Sofmer website, represents a selection of articles that may be non-exhaustive, yet is maximally diversified and as representative as possible of the main 2011 highlights in the field of cardiovascular prevention. Each of the articles selected puts forward an original idea, confirms the existence of an effect that was suspected or has had some impact on clinical practice in the field of non-pharmacological management of cardiovascular disease. In line with the multidisciplinary approach of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR), the Sofmer cardiovascular rehabilitation group has associated itself with a wide range of specialists (PMR, cardiologists, exercise physiologists, experts in the science and technology of physical activities), all of whom are involved in clinical research and the management of more and more patients. Our objective was consequently to compile a selection of commented articles most likely to interest the different operatives (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, adapted physical activity instructors, psychologists) working with these patients in rehabilitation units or in phase III associative structures. Their goals may vary: (1) learners may wish to further their knowledge of cardiac rehabilitation techniques; (2) practitioners may be interested in continued education but not have the time for regular bibliographic updates; (3) researchers may be intent on informing themselves on the latest breakthroughs and/or arousing their imagination...Enjoy your reading!"
