        "According to ASMBS, the rate of bariatric surgery increased from 158,000 in 2011 to 196,000 in 2015. Nevertheless, this growth in invasive techniques does not eliminate unhealthy habits, so lifestyle modification such as healthy nutrition and correct physical activity programs may improve surgical results. The objective of the present narrative review was to categorize the guidelines related to nutrition, physical activity, and supplement prescription before and after bariatric surgery. The main key words including nutrition, diet, physical activity, exercise, supplements, macronutrients, micronutrients, weight reduction, bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrostomy, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch were searched in databases including PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and some other sources such as Google scholar. The recommendations are classified based on the type of surgery. The indications for surgery and the type of bariatric surgery are not included in this review. This review helps medical teams, including bariatric surgeons, nutritionists, and sports medicine specialists, with proper management before and after bariatric surgery."
