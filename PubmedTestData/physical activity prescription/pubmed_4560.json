        "Following a prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis, treatment-related symptoms may result in diminished quality of life (QoL). Improved diet and increased exercise may improve QoL in men with PC.",
        "We conducted a 4-arm pilot randomized trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of a 3-month web-based diet and exercise intervention, among men (>18\u2009years of age) with PC (reported elsewhere). The purpose of this study is to describe the change in QoL measured by surveys (eg, QLQ-C30, PROMIS Fatigue) at enrollment and following the intervention. Men were randomized 1:1:1:1 to increasing levels of web-based behavioral support: Level 1: website; Level 2: Level 1 plus personalized diet and exercise prescription; Level 3: Levels 1-2 plus Fitbit and text messages; Level 4: Levels 1-3 plus 2 30-minute coaching calls. <i>T</i>-tests were used to compare pre-post change in mean QoL scores between each Level and Level 1.",
        "Two hundred and two men consented and were randomized (n\u2009=\u200949, 51, 50, 52 for Levels 1-4, respectively). Men were predominantly white (93%), with a median age of 70\u2009years (Intra-quartile Range [IQR]: 65,75) and 3\u2009years (IQR: 1,9) post primary treatment for mostly localized disease (74% with T1-2). There were no meaningful changes in QoL, but there were notable trends. Level 3 participants had small improvements in QLQ-C30 Global Health (5.46; 95% CI: -0.02, 10.95) compared to Level 1. In contrast, Level 2 participants trended toward decreasing Global QoL (-2.31, 95% CI: -8.05, 3.42), which may reflect declines in function (eg, Cognitive: -6.94, 95% CI: -13.76, -0.13) and higher symptom burden (eg, Diarrhea: 4.63, 95% CI: -1.48, 10.74).",
        "This short, web-based intervention did not appear to have an impact on PC survivors' QoL. Most men were several years past treatment for localized disease; the potential for this approach to reduce symptoms and improve QoL in men who have worse health may still be warranted."
