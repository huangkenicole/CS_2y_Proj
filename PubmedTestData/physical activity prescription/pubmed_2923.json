      "AbstractText": [
        "To determine whether physical exercise interventions can improve cognitive function, including overall performance and specific domains, in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to provide potential evidence on how cognitive benefits can be optimized by exercise prescriptions.",
        "Using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library (from inception to August 2022), four independent reviewers screened the search results and extracted data from randomized controlled trials of physical exercise interventions in patients with PD with an outcome measure of cognitive function. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs).",
        "Twenty-one randomized controlled trials including 761 patients with PD were eligible for inclusion. Physical exercise interventions led to significant improvements in global cognitive function (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.69; 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.31 to 1.06; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). With respect to cognitive domains, the significant effect of exercise was found on executive function (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.94; 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.05 to 1.83; P\u00a0=\u00a00.039), but not on attention/working memory, language, memory, and visuospatial function. In moderator variable analyses, the effect on global cognition was observed in combined exercise programs (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.79; 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.46 to 1.12; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas there were no significant positive effects in aerobic exercise programs, strength exercise programs, and flexibility exercise programs. In addition, exercise interventions of light-to-moderate intensity with at least 60\u00a0min in duration, and of any frequency or period, were beneficial to the global cognitive function.",
        "This updated systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that physical exercise interventions are effective in improving global cognitive function and, to a lesser extent, executive function in patients with PD. At least 60\u00a0min a day of combined exercise programs on as many days of the week as feasible may be recommended as the non-pharmacological therapeutic option to improve cognitive function."
