        "Medication mismanagement is a serious health issue affecting elders and people with disabilities, who often manage multiple medications. This project's goal was to educate medical and nursing students about the challenges patients face when managing complex medication regimens.",
        "A total of 104 first-year medical students and 40 second-year nursing students were randomly assigned to participate in a 1-week regimen of mock prescriptions or to read a description of the regimen and make predictions about what the experience would be like had they participated.",
        "Quantitative results in combination with qualitative information suggest that the students taking the mock prescriptions gained important insights into the difficulty of managing a complicated medication regimen.",
        "This mock prescription exercise, well accepted by students and faculty, was easily incorporated into the curriculum and provided an experiential opportunity for students to learn of the difficulties of medication adherence."
