      "AbstractText": [
        "Swedish physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an evidence-based method to promote physical activity. However, few studies have investigated the effect of Swedish PAP on physical fitness, in which better cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality and diagnose-specific mortality. Direct measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, usually expressed as maximal oxygen uptake, are difficult to obtain. Hence, exercise capacity can be assessed from a submaximal cycle ergometer test, taking the linear relationship between heart rate, work rate, and oxygen uptake into account. The aim of this study was to evaluate exercise capacity in the long term, following PAP treatment with enhanced physiotherapist support in a nonresponding patient cohort. In total, 98 patients (48 women) with insufficient physical activity levels, with at least one component of the metabolic syndrome and nonresponding to a previous six-month PAP treatment, were randomized to PAP treatment with enhanced support from a physiotherapist and additional exercise capacity tests during a two-year period. A significant increase in exercise capacity was observed for the whole cohort at two-year follow-up (7.6 W, <i>p</i> \u2264 0.001), with a medium effect size (r = 0.34). Females (7.3 W, <i>p</i> = 0.025), males (8.0 W, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and patients \u226558 years old (7.7 W, <i>p</i> = 0.002) improved significantly, whereas a nonsignificant increase was observed for patients <58 years old (7.6 W, <i>p</i> = 0.085). Patients with insufficient physical activity levels who did not respond to a previous six-month PAP treatment can improve their exercise capacity following PAP treatment with enhanced support from a physiotherapist during a two-year period. Future studies should include larger cohorts with a control group to ensure valid estimations of exercise capacity and PAP."
