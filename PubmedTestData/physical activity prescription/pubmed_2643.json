        "\u00a0In the elderly, low protein intake exacerbates the effects of sarcopenia and anabolic resistance. \u00a0Protein supplementation to maximise muscle protein synthesis, may be an effective intervention.\u00a0Aim:\u00a0To determine the effects of a low/high dose of protein, ingested immediately post-exercise, during resistance training in novice elderly males.\u00a0Method:\u00a024 elderly (70.5\u00b15.1, years) males were recruited (body mass: 92.4\u00b114.9 kg; fat free mass: 61.4\u00b17.6 kg).\u00a0 After exclusion criteria, 18 males participated. Participants continued their normal dietary intake and were allocated into two matched groups, then randomly assigned to either a 20 g or 40 g dose intervention. Following determination of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), participants completed 10 x 3d<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0wk resistance training and consumed protein supplements immediately following exercise.\u00a0Results:\u00a0Significant improvements in chest press (p = 0.014, \u0273p<sup>2</sup>\u00a00.34) shoulder press (p = 0.005, \u0273p<sup>2</sup>\u00a00.43) and leg extension strength (p = 0.014, \u0273p<sup>2</sup>\u00a00.34), were observed following the 40 g dose, resulting in performance improvements of 19.1, 21.1, and 16.1% respectively, compared to the 20 g dose.\u00a0Conclusion:Findings suggest that ingesting 40 g of protein following resistance exercise, produces greater responses to training and may be an important nutritional strategy when prescribing resistance exercise in the elderly."
