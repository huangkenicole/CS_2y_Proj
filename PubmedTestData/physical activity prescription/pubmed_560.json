      "AbstractText": [
        "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, currently affecting 2-3% of the world's population. Traditional exercise and physical activity interventions have been successfully implemented in the management of AF, with the aim of improving patients' quality of life and their exercise capacity, as well as reducing their mortality rate. Currently, new technology-mediated approaches to exercise, defined as exergame, have been shown to be successful in the delivery of exercise home-based interventions in patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, data on the effects of exergame on AF are not yet available. In this paper, we summarise the current literature on the role of traditional exercise in AF and how it affects the pathophysiology of this condition. We also review the current literature on exergame and its employment in cardiac rehabilitation and suggest its potential role in the management of AF patients. A review of the evidence suggests that traditional exercise (of light-to-moderate intensity) is beneficial in patients with AF. Additionally, exergame seems to be a promising approach for delivering exercise interventions in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Exergame may be a promising tool to improve the quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with AF, with the additional advantage of being remotely delivered, and the potential to increase patients' engagement. Proper guidelines are required to prescribe exergame interventions, considering the principles of traditional exercise prescription and applying them to this new e-health approach. Further studies are needed to validate the use of exergame in patients with AF."
