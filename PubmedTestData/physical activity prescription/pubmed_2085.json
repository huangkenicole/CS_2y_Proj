        "Evidence supports an important role for pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) after acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD); however, the role of physical exercise during hospitalisation is less clear. This study evaluated Australian physiotherapy practice and clinical perspectives regarding exercise and physical activity for patients with AECOPD. A national survey of 123 Australian public hospitals was conducted from 2016 to 2017 using a purpose-designed survey measuring self-reported physical exercise prescription, objective measure use, referral patterns and factors influencing service delivery. The response rate was 72% (88 hospitals; 176 physiotherapists). Most physiotherapists (92%) prescribed physical exercise frequently for patients with AECOPD and perceived their role to be important (81%). The most commonly prescribed modalities were ground walking (94%), sit-to-stand (89%) and non-equipment-based lower limb strengthening (79%). Only 32% of respondents offered physiotherapy evaluation during post-discharge outpatient clinic appointments at their hospital. While 71% of respondents indicated they frequently referred patients to PR after AECOPD, rates were significantly higher in those with more cardiorespiratory experience (82%) than those with less experience (66%; <i>p</i> = 0.026). Australian physiotherapists frequently prescribe simple physical exercise modalities for patients with AECOPD. PR referral rates appear influenced by clinician experience, which may need consideration in future remedial strategies."
