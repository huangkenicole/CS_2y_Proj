      "AbstractText": [
        "In the Swedish population aged between 50 and 64\u00a0years only 7.1% reach the recommended level of physical activity. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) has been used in Sweden since the beginning of the twenty-first century with moderate adherence of approximately 50%. Mindfulness seems to affect motivation to and satisfaction with physical activity. The aim is to test the feasibility of a study in routine care; i.e. to test if mindfulness can improve adherence to PAP, measured by changes in physical activity.",
        "We will include 90 sedentary individuals, aged 40-65\u00a0years, from primary health care centres in Sweden. Individuals will be randomised to only PAP, mindfulness and PAP or mindfulness only. The PAP group will be based on patients' preferences. The mindfulness groups will meet once a week for 8 weeks and practise 20\u00a0min of individual training per day. There will not be any motivational interview or physical activity on prescription in the group assigned to only mindfulness. The participants will complete the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index and also answer questions concerning their lifestyle. Physical activity will be measured by ACTi Graph GT1X activity monitor at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Patients with a severe psychological disease, unstable angina or a recent myocardial infarction will be excluded. The main outcome will be adherence to PAP in an ordinary primary health care setting. In this pilot study, we will also evaluate measures such as the recruitment rate, number of dropouts and adherence to mindfulness practice.",
        "This study is the first to explore the effect of mindfulness on adherence to PAP and test the feasibility of the study design.",
