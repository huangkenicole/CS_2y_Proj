        "The prevalence of physical inactivity continues to rise despite there being sufficient evidence to indicate the appropriate dosage of exercise to mitigate risk for many non-communicable diseases. This rise in physical inactivity is unlikely related to exercise prescription knowledge, but rather in the way exercise is prescribed. Current exercise prescription guidelines are characterized by the FITT Principle: Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type. In order to target this physical inactivity epidemic, many have focused on the manipulation FITT components. However, perhaps this is not where the focus needs to lie - at least not as FITT is currently defined. Instead, we propose a change may be needed to the way exercise is prescribed - inclusion of measurement of enjoyment. This measurement of enjoyment is crucial to better inform exercise prescription, and may be the missing piece to overcome these high rates of physical inactivity."
