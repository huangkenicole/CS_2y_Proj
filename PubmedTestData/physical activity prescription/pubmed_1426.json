      "AbstractText": [
        "Over the past two decades, scientists have attempted to evaluate whether the point of maximal fat oxidation (FAT<sub>max</sub>) and the aerobic threshold (AerT) are connected. The existence of such a relationship would allow a more tailored training approach for athletes while improving the efficacy of individualized exercise prescriptions when treating numerous health-related issues. However, studies have reported conflicting results, and this issue remains unresolved. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed: (i) to examine the strength of the association between FAT<sub>max</sub> and AerT by using the effect size (ES) of correlation coefficient (r) and standardized mean difference (SMD); (ii) to identify potential moderators and their influence on ES variability. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021239351) and ClinicalTrials (NCT03789045). PubMed and Google Scholar were searched and fourteen articles, consisting of overall 35 ES for <i>r</i> and 26 ES for SMD were included. Obtained ESs were analyzed using a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Our results support the presence of a significant association between FAT<sub>max</sub> and AerT exercise intensities. In conclusion, due to the large ES variance caused by clinical and methodological differences among the studies, we recommend that future studies follow strict standardization of data collection and analysis of FAT<sub>max</sub> and AerT-related outcomes."
