        "The purpose of this study is to compare the physical fitness level of adolescents through a physical fitness assessment and a circuit exercise program. A total of 142 middle school students participated. Physical education class consists of a physical fitness assessment, namely, physical activity promotion system (PAPS), and a circuit exercise program. The PAPS measurements include endurance, flexibility, strength, power, body mass index, and total score. The circuit exercise program consists of twist spine, hand walking, rolling squat, cross knee up, jumping and squat, and level-up pacer. First, there were significant differences in PAPS and circuit exercise program according to grade. Second, there was a significant difference in the results of the circuit exercise program according to the level of each physical fitness variable of PAPS. Third, significant correlations were found in the results of the PAPS and circuit exercise program. The use of a circuit exercise program to measure fitness for adolescents can offer convenience for school physical education and be of value as a measure of physical fitness for adolescents. In addition, the circulatory exercise programs used in this study are thought to be applicable to exercise prescriptions to improve endurance, strength, and BMI."
