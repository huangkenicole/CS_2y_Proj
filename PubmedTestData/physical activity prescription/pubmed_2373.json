        "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children, and it's linked to a higher risk of academic failure, interpersonal issues, mental illness, and criminality. Despite several of the comparative and detailed reviews on the effects of ADHD interventions on core symptoms, there is no data summarizing the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) on executive functions (EFs). Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and determine the relationship between AE (acute and chronic) dosage and EFs (attention, inhibition, set-shifting, and working memory) in youth with ADHD. The consideration of how AE dosage impacts aspects of EFs has not been investigated in detail previously. The study adhered to PRISMA guideline. Sixdatabases were searched without any date restrictions, up to February 2021, for articles relating to AE interventions to influence EFs in youth with ADHD<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>\u2264</mo></math>18\u00a0years old. Quality assessment of the reviewed papers was addressed. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Improvements in all aspects of EFs were reported after children with ADHD engaged in acute AE lasting 20-30\u00a0minutes with at least moderate intensity (65% \u2264 80% HR<sub>max</sub>).Furthermore, chronic exercise that lasts at least 45\u00a0minutes and in the range of moderate tohigh intensity (i.e., 60% \u2264 75% HR<sub>max</sub>), 3\u00a0days/week for 6-12, elicits additional benefits in inhibition and set-shifting.Different dosage of AE might differently influence aspects of EFs; however, this finding rests on preliminary evidence at this stage and thus should be treated with caution.It is necessary to establish suitable interventions with regard to the dosage of AE types to improve EFs in young people with ADHD."
