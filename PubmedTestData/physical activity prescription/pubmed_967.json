        "Physical activity (PA) counselling is an intervention to promote PA among patients in primary care, yet it remains limited in this clinical setting. This study aimed to explore PA counselling practices among general practitioners (GPs), as well as barriers to and recommendations for improving PA counselling.",
        "This qualitative study employed a descriptive approach. Data were collected by in-depth interviews and analysed by thematic analysis. The study was conducted in district hospitals in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, from February 2017 to February 2018. The study participants were GPs who worked at district hospitals.",
        "Seventeen GPs (6 males and 11 females, mean age 29.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2009years) from 6 district hospitals were interviewed. Their clinical experience ranged from 2 to 12\u2009years (mean 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9). The GPs saw 30-80 outpatients/day (mean 56.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.1) and spent 1-8\u2009min (mean 3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8) with each patient. They emphasised PA in patients with poorly controlled non-communicable diseases (NCDs) using the word 'exercise' in the Thai language as well as discussing time and frequency of exercise. PA was considered a non-pharmacological treatment in the management of NCDs, which improved patient health and quality of life. Barriers to PA counselling among GPs included time constraints, insufficient knowledge, and lack of opportunities to follow-up previously counselled patients. GPs suggested that training in PA counselling was required.",
        "GPs concurred that PA counselling is essential in the treatment of NCDs. Physicians' recommendations to improve the quality of PA counselling in primary care include 3 Ts: training in PA counselling, tools for prescribing PA, and teams of healthcare professionals. Implementing use of written PA prescriptions may encourage patients to increase PA. Multidisciplinary teams should be developed to support PA counselling in the clinical setting. Further studies should focus on appropriate techniques to implement PA counselling and overcome existing barriers."
