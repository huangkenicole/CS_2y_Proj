        "While high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as a more time-efficient alternative to moderate-intensity steady-state exercise (MISS), the impact on systemic free radical formation and link to activated coagulation remains unknown. We recruited sixteen healthy males aged 21\u2009\u00b1\u20093 y who performed incremental cycle ergometry to determine peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text] <sub>PEAK</sub>). Participants were randomly assigned single blind to two separate groups (MISS: n\u2009=\u20098; HIIT: n\u2009=\u20098) matched for [Formula: see text] <sub>PEAK</sub>. HIIT participants completed five exercise cycles, each consisting of 3\u00a0min at 80%[Formula: see text] <sub>PEAK</sub> alternating with 3\u00a0min at 40% [Formula: see text] <sub>PEAK</sub>, whereas MISS participants performed an isovolumic bout of 30\u00a0min at 60% [Formula: see text] <sub>PEAK</sub>. Cephalic venous blood was assayed for ascorbate free radical (A<sup>\u2022-</sup>, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) and clot fractal dimension (d<sub>f</sub>, rheometry) at rest every hour over a 6-h period to determine critical difference (CD) and before/after submaximal/peak exercise. Submaximal MISS increased A<sup>\u2022 -</sup> and d<sub>f</sub> to a greater extent compared to HIIT (P\u2009=\u20090.039 to 0.057) although elevations generally fell within CD boundaries (54.2% and 5.5% respectively). No further elevations were observed during peak exercise (P\u2009=\u20090.508 to 0.827) and no relationships were observed between A<sup>\u2022-</sup> and d<sub>f</sub> (r\u2009=\u20090.435 to\u2009-\u20090.121, P\u2009=\u20090.092 to 0.655). Collectively, these findings suggest that HIIT is less pro-oxidative/thrombotic compared to more traditional MISS, advocating its prescription in patients given the potential for superior vascular adaptive benefit."
