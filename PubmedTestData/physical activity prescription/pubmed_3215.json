        "Research has shown that some bariatric patients overestimate post-surgical exercise levels, while others struggle with negative cognitions and follow-through on intentions to exercise; however, little exists on specific barriers affecting bariatric patients' post-surgical exercise behaviors. Considering that regular exercise is a predictor of weight loss maintenance, further research is warranted. Survey methodology was utilized to assess post-operative exercise barriers as well as beneficial post-surgical exercise services among a sample of bariatric patients solicited from an online support website. Qualitative assessment of responses was completed using inductive content analysis. Higher-order themes for exercise barriers included internal, external, and no barriers; generic categories determined for internal barriers included motivational and physical barriers. Of the participants, 78% reported at least one internal motivational barrier, and the most frequently reported subcategorical barrier was time (28%); physical barriers were reported related to surgery (9%) or other chronic conditions (19%). Higher-order themes for exercise services included positive descriptions such as benefits from exercise prescription as well as the importance of facilities and individuals, while negative descriptions included no services available or services that were unhelpful. Participants cited the benefit of community-based facilities, so providers might consider partnering with local professionals to deliver exercise services. Staff should be aware of physical barriers specific to bariatric populations including issues with post-surgical stamina and chronic comorbid conditions in order to provide appropriate exercise prescription. In addition, as motivational and time barriers occur frequently, providers should be well-trained on how to help patients overcome these impediments to exercise maintenance."
