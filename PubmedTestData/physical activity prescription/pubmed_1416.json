        "The population is getting older. Rehabilitation can play an essential strategic role to counteract impairments and disability which characterize the elderly. Correct rehabilitative programmes have to be approached on the functional limitation and residual abilities of elders. Leading a more active lifestyle and regular physical activity including aerobic and resistance exercises have been demonstrated to improve cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and cognitive wellbeing in older adults. Occupational therapy, prescription of assistive devices, environmental, and home living adaptation, and family or caregiver educational training represent an essential rehabilitative strategy in elders developing disability. In these people, falls are dramatic events that lead to hospitalization, functional decline, decreased social activity, and poor quality of life. Rehabilitation incorporating balance, gait, and strength training exercise interventions can reduce the risk of falls. Frailty refers to a condition characterized by a gradual physiologic decline in multiple body systems, loss of physiologic reserve, and increased vulnerability to disease and death. Several therapeutic strategies have been proposed including exercises, multi-component training and approaches, all aimed at decreasing the need for nursing home placement, hospitalization, and reducing dependence and death. In these subjects, geriatric comprehensive assessment and the multi-disciplinary team have recently been demonstrated to be more effective than usual care."
