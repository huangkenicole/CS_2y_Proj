        "The 2018 evidence-based polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guidelines recommend lifestyle management as first-line treatment. This study aims to understand the preferred intervention characteristics of a PCOS lifestyle program from the perspectives of women with PCOS to inform the translation of the guidelines into practice.",
        "Women with self-reported PCOS residing in Australia took part in semi-structured interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and an online survey (n\u00a0=\u00a0286). The survey and interview schedule were developed using the template for intervention description and replication checklist.",
        "Women want to take part in a lifestyle program (94.6%) and use government-subsidised sessions to attend (83%). Sessions of 45 to 60\u2009minutes (75%) costing less than AUD$50 are preferred (60%). Topics of most interest related to sustainable daily physical activity (58%), overcoming non-hungry eating (54%), PCOS-specific diets (51%) and how to overcome barriers to behaviour change (45%). A delivery mode that combines online and in-person support is preferred (53%). Women are in need of long-term professional lifestyle support (6-12\u2009months) that provides evidence-based, PCOS-specific, personalised prescription. Multidisciplinary support from a range of PCOS-trained professions is also preferred to address women's physical, psychological and emotional needs.",
        "Women with PCOS are willing to take part in lifestyle programs that are low cost, long term, evidence based, PCOS-specific and provide practical strategies for nutrition and physical activity changes. Future online and in-person PCOS programs are strongly recommended to incorporate these findings to improve program engagement and patient satisfaction."
