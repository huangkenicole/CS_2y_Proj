        "The role of pain sensitivity in the development and maintenance of chronic pain states, impaired executive functioning, and patient recovery is being investigated. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is widely used to measure musculoskeletal pain associated with central sensitization (CS). Despite the recommendations of many reviews and clinical practice guidelines that exercise programs reduce pain and disability, the overall confidence in these results is considered \"critically low.\" The \"active ingredient\" of exercise programs and the dominant factor influencing CPM remain largely unknown. The objectives of this trial are to determine: \u2022 If different exercises cause different results on the CPM in a subgroup of people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who are labeled as having CS pain, \u2022 If a program of exercise interventions for 12\u00a0weeks would alter executive functioning, quality of life (QoL), disability, and pain in persons with CLBP. \u2022 The relationship between patient characteristics, executive functions, CPM, and QoL METHODS: The trial is a randomized, controlled, multi-center study with four experimental groups and one healthy control group. Both the researchers and the people in the study will be blinded to the results. This paper describes the protocol for a trial examining the effects of 12-week individualized, twice-weekly exercise sessions lasting 30 to 60\u00a0min in persons with CLBP, who are positive for CS. Participants will be randomized to receive either patient education with motor control exercises (MCE), superficial strengthening (SS), aerobic exercises (AE), or patient education alone. Another group comprised of healthy volunteers will serve as controls. The primary outcomes are changes in CPM outcomes as measured by the cold pressor test (CPT). The secondary objectives are to evaluate executive functioning, pain, disability, quality of life, and spine muscle strength. The outcomes will be measured at 3\u00a0months and at a 6-month follow-up.",
        "The outcomes of the study will help in gaining more information and evidence about exercise-induced analgesia from the perspective of CPM. Measuring exercise outcomes will aid in scientifically prescribing exercise prescriptions in people with CLBP. The study outcomes will also assist in identifying the characteristics of individuals who will respond or respond indifferently to exercises. Investigating the relationship between the study's various outcomes could provide information for future trials.",
