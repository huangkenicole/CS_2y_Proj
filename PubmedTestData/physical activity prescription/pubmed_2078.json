        "To determine the macrovascular and microvascular function responses to resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR) compared to high-load resistance training (HLRT) control group.",
        "Twenty-four young, healthy men were randomly assigned to BFR or HLRT. Participants performed bilateral knee extensions and leg presses 4\u00a0days per week, for 4\u00a0weeks. For each exercise, BFR completed 3 X 10 repetitions/day at 30% of 1-repetition max (RM). The occlusive pressure was applied at 1.3 times of individual systolic blood pressure. The exercise prescription was identical for HLRT, except the intensity was set at 75% of one repetition maximum. Outcomes were measured pre-, at 2- and 4-weeks during the training period. The primary macrovascular function outcome was heart-ankle pulse wave velocity (haPWV), and the primary microvascular function outcome was tissue oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>) area under the curve (AUC) response to reactive hyperemia.",
        "Knee extension and leg press 1-RM increased by 14% for both groups. There was a significant interaction effect for haPWV, decreasing -\u00a05% (\u0394-0.32\u00a0m/s, 95% confidential interval [CI] -\u00a00.51 to - 0.12, effect size [ES]\u2009=\u2009 -\u00a00.53) for BFR and increasing 1% (\u03940.03\u00a0m/s, 95%CI -\u00a00.17 to 0.23, ES\u2009=\u20090.05) for HLRT. Similarly, there was an interaction effect for StO<sub>2</sub> AUC, increasing 5% (\u039447%\uff65s, 95%CI -\u00a03.07 to 98.1, ES\u2009=\u20090.28) for HLRT and 17% (\u0394159%\uff65s, 95%CI 108.23-209.37, ES\u2009=\u20090.93) for BFR group.",
        "The current findings suggest that BFR may improve macro- and microvascular function compared to HLRT."
