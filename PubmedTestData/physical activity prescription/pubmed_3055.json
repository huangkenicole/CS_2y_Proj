      "AbstractText": [
        "Exercise therapy is an important treatment option for people with intermittent claudication (IC). Appropriate reporting of exercise interventions in populations with IC within randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is important to ensure that research can be translated into clinical practice. Therefore, the purpose of our review is to evaluate the reporting of exercise interventions in RCTs of exercise therapy in patients with IC.",
        "A systematic search was performed to identify relevant trials in patients with IC published until May 2020. Studies including only participants with critical limb ischaemia or asymptomatic peripheral artery disease were excluded. Each trial was scored using the recently developed 'Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template' (CERT) which has a maximum obtainable score of 19.",
        "Of 1489 unique records identified from the search, 73 trials were included, reporting 107 exercise interventions. Overall, the average CERT score was 10/19. The exercise equipment used, the use of supervision and a description of whether the exercise prescription was tailored or generic were the most frequently reported intervention components. The motivational strategies used, intervention adherence and intervention fidelity were the most underreported CERT components. There was no trend indicating that CERT scores were higher in more recent publications.",
        "We have identified that important details about exercise interventions are frequently missing from the published literature. These missing data hinder replication of research findings and limit the translation of evidence into clinical practice."
