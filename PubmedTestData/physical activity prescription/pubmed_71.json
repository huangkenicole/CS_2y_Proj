        "Metabolic syndrome as a consequence of the association to overweight, hypertension, and diabetes is at high risk of coronary events. Regular physical training has been recently promoted to reduce cardiovascular risks factors, by the improved lifestyle and also by the \"anti-inflammatory effectiveness.\" A positive impact has been shown in case of cancer survived patients either with or without comorbidities and especially in those subjects where the inflammatory process is globally represented. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines and more recently a new Italian model both support the role of \"exercise as therapy\" at moderate level of energy expenditure. The importance to establish the individual level of physical exercise, like a drug's dose, has induced authors in investigating this aspect in diverse diseases and in different clinical fields associated to an incorrect lifestyle habits. To reach this goal, a specific research strategy is important to spread the knowledge."
