        "In recent years, complex models of cardiac regulation have integrated heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of the cardiac autonomic activity during exercise. Using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) technique, the present study examines the influence of cycling cadence and exercise duration on non-linear dynamics of HRV. Sixteen trained cyclists performed a 60-minute exercise bout at 90% of the individual anaerobic threshold on a bicycle ergometer. Cadence was changed every 10\u202fmin (90-120-60-120-60-90\u202frpm). Heart rate (HR) and RR-intervals were recorded continuously during exercise. HRV time domain measures (meanRR, SDNN) and correlation properties were analyzed using short-term scaling exponent alpha1 of DFA. Moreover, blood lactate (La) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded at regular intervals at the end of condition. HR, La and RPE increased significantly at 120\u202frpm compared to 60\u202frpm. In contrast, all analyzed HRV parameters (meanRR, SDNN, DFA-alpha1) showed a significant decrease during cycling at 120\u202frpm compared to 60\u202frpm. The comparison of the first and last 10\u202fmin with the same cadence indicates a significant increase in HR and RPE, but also a significant decrease in all analyzed HRV measures. The decrease of HRV values over time and in relation to the increase in cadence indicates a decrease in the overall variability as well as a reduction in complexity of the RR-interval-fluctuations due to the increased organismic demands. Therefore, the decrease of DFA-alpha1 might be associated with a withdrawal of the organismic system aiming at the maintenance of the homeostasis under the control of the central nervous system. In this context, non-linear HRV analyses provide a more systemic view of cardiac regulation during exercise."
