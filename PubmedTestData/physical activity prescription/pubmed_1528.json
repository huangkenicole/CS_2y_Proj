      "AbstractText": [
        "This study sought to determine if personalized moderate-intensity continuous exercise training (MICT) combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) was more effective at improving comprehensive training responsiveness than MICT alone. Apparently healthy, but physically inactive men and women (<i>n</i> = 54) were randomized to a non-exercise control group or one of two 13-week exercise training groups: (1) a personalized MICT + HIIT aerobic and resistance training program based on the American Council on Exercise guidelines, or (2) a standardized MICT aerobic and resistance training program designed according to current American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. Mean changes in maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) and Metabolic (MetS) z-score in the personalized MICT + HIIT group were more favorable (<i>p</i> < 0.05) when compared to both the standardized MICT and control groups. Additionally, on the individual level, there were positive improvements in VO<sub>2max</sub> (\u0394 > 4.9%) and MetS z-score (\u0394 \u2264 -0.48) in 100% (16/16) of participants in the personalized MICT + HIIT group. In the present study, a personalized exercise prescription combining MICT + HIIT in conjunction with resistance training elicited greater improvements in VO<sub>2max</sub>, MetS z-score reductions, and diminished inter-individual variation in VO<sub>2max</sub> and cardiometabolic training responses when compared to standardized MICT."
