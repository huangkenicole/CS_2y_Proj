        "Isocaloric interval exercise training programs have been shown to elicit improvements in numerous physiological indices in patients with CAD. Low-volume high-intensity interval exercise training (HIT) is effective in healthy populations; however, its effectiveness in cardiac rehabilitation has not been established. This study compared the effects of 12-wk of HIT and higher-volume moderate-intensity endurance exercise (END) on brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) in patients with CAD.",
        "Twenty-two patients with documented CAD were randomized into HIT (n = 11) or END (n = 11) based on pretraining FMD. Both groups attended two supervised sessions per week for 12 wk. END performed 30-50 min of continuous cycling at 58% peak power output (PPO), whereas HIT performed ten 1-min intervals at 89% PPO separated by 1-min intervals at 10% PPO per session.",
        "Relative FMD was increased posttraining (END, 4.4% \u00b1 2.6% vs 5.9% \u00b1 3.6%; HIT, 4.6% \u00b1 3.6% vs 6.1% \u00b1 3.4%, P \u2264 0.001 pre- vs posttraining) with no differences between groups. A training effect was also observed for relative VO2 peak (END, 18.7 \u00b1 5.7 vs 22.3 \u00b1 6.1 mL \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1); HIT, 19.8 \u00b1 3.7 vs 24.5 \u00b1 4.5 mL \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1), P < 0.001 for pre- vs posttraining), with no group differences.",
        "Low-volume HIT provides an alternative to the current, more time-intensive prescription for cardiac rehabilitation. HIT elicited similar improvements in fitness and FMD as END, despite differences in exercise duration and intensity."
