      "AbstractText": [
        "There is individual variability in weight change in response to physical activity interventions. Secondary analyses explored whether there were differences in physical activity, dietary intake, and the domains of hunger, dietary disinhibition, or dietary restraint in response to different physical activity interventions and by pattern of weight change across 6 months of an intervention. Participants (N = 207; age: 44.8 \u00b1 8.2 years; body mass index: 27.0 \u00b1 1.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included in these secondary analyses. Participants were randomly assigned to (1) a self-help physical activity intervention, (2) a prescription to progress to 150 min/week of physical activity, or (3) a prescription to progress to 300 min/week of physical activity and following 6 months were categorized based on weight change (weight gain, stability, or loss). Intervention conditions did not differ for change in weight, physical activity, dietary intake, and measures of hunger, dietary disinhibition, and total dietary restraint. Categories of weight change did not differ for change in physical activity or dietary intake, but the category of weight loss had significantly greater decreases in hunger and increases in flexible dietary restraint compared to the categories of weight stability and weight gain. The findings may provide insight into the variability in weight change in response to physical activity."
