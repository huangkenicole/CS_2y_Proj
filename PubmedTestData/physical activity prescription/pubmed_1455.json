        "This study assessed associations between severity of, and prescription medication use for, chronic low back pain (CLBP) and health-related quality of life, health status, work productivity, and healthcare resource utilization.",
        "This cross-sectional study utilized SF-12, EQ-5D-5L, and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) questionnaires, and visits to healthcare providers among adults with self-reported CLBP participating in the National Health and Wellness Survey in Germany, France, UK, Italy, and Spain. Respondents were stratified into four groups according to pain severity (mild or moderate/severe) and prescription medication use (Rx-treated or Rx-untreated). Differences between groups were estimated using generalized linear models controlling for sociodemographics and health characteristics.",
        "Of 2086 respondents with CLBP, 683 had mild pain (276 Rx-untreated, 407 Rx-treated) and 1403 had moderate/severe pain (781 Rx-untreated, 622 Rx-treated). Respondents with moderate/severe pain had significantly worse health-related quality of life (SF-12v2 physical component summary), health status (EQ-5D-5L), and both absenteeism and presenteeism compared with those with mild pain, including Rx-untreated (moderate/severe pain Rx-untreated vs. mild pain Rx-untreated, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) and Rx-treated (moderate/severe pain Rx-treated vs. mild pain Rx-treated, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) groups. Significantly more visits to healthcare providers in the last 6\u00a0months were reported for moderate/severe pain compared with mild pain for Rx-treated (least squares mean 13.01 vs. 10.93, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) but not Rx-untreated (8.72 vs. 7.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.072) groups. Health-related quality of life (SF-12v2 physical component summary) and health status (EQ-5D-5L), as well as absenteeism and presenteeism, were significantly worse, and healthcare utilization was significantly higher, in the moderate/severe pain Rx-treated group compared with all other groups (all p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).",
        "Greater severity of CLBP was associated with worse health-related quality of life, health status, and absenteeism and presenteeism, irrespective of prescription medication use. Greater severity of CLBP was associated with increased healthcare utilization in prescription medication users."
