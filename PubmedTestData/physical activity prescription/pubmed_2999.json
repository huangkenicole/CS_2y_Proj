        "To determine the vastus lateralis muscle temperature kinetics during and after passive heating, to exam the effect of sex on thermoregulatory responses, and the thermal safety and tolerance of the 42\u00a0\u00b0C hot-water immersion protocol.",
        "Thirty participants (15 males, 15 females) underwent a 2\u00a0h 42\u00a0\u00baC hot-water immersion to the waist level. Vastus lateralis, rectal and skin temperature, thermal sensation, heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were measured during the passive heating and recovery period. Participant recovery was monitored until muscle temperature returned to baseline.",
        "Vastus lateralis temperature increased to a maximal value of 39.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0\u00b0C (P\u2009<\u20090.001), reaching a plateau after\u2009~\u200983.5\u00a0min of hot-water immersion and returning to baseline after\u2009~\u2009115.8\u00a0min of recovery. Despite the anthropometric differences between males and females (e.g., height, body mass, body fat %, and fat thickness; P\u2009<\u20090.05), thermoregulatory responses showed no differences between sexes (P\u2009>\u20090.05). No change was found in systolic BP (~\u2009117\u00a0mmHg; P\u2009=\u20090.061). Peak rectal temperature (38.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0\u00b0C; P\u2009<\u20090.001), heart rate (~\u2009100\u00a0bpm; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and diastolic BP (\u2193\u2009~\u200913\u00a0mmHg; P\u2009<\u20090.001) during the hot-water immersion indicated the safety of the protocol. While skin temperature (~\u200935.4\u00a0\u00b0C; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and thermal sensation (~\u20095.95 AU; P\u2009<\u20090.001) confirmed protocol tolerance.",
        "These data demonstrate lower-body 42\u00a0\u00b0C hot-water immersion to increase vastus lateralis temperature and plateau\u2009~\u20092.8\u00a0\u00b0C above baseline. This amplitude of muscle temperature change aligns with reported cellular adaptation and muscle growth. Thermal strain incurred from this protocol appears safe and tolerable, positioning it well for health-related prescription."
