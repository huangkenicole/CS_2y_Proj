        "Growing evidence supports hip muscle activation and strengthening exercise prescription to prevent and treat various lower limb injuries. Common prescriptions include single-legged and double-legged squatting, with and without a Swiss ball. We aimed to establish the effect of varying forms of squatting exercises on gluteal muscle activation.",
        "Observational laboratory study.",
        "Nineteen (11 male) healthy participants (28.4\u00a0+/-\u00a02.7 years old) were compared using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance.",
        "Surface electromyography (EMG) measures of gluteus medius (GMed) and gluteus maximus (GMax) during the isometric phase of single-legged and double-legged squatting, with and without a Swiss ball.",
        "A greater percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) during single-legged squatting was found compared to double-legged squatting for GMed (42 versus 9%MVC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and GMax (35 versus 14%MVC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, the Swiss ball increased GMax activity (42 versus 35%MVC, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and demonstrated a trend toward increased GMed activity (46 versus 42%MVC, p\u00a0=\u00a00.075) during the single-legged squat.",
        "These results indicate single-legged squatting may be more appropriate than double-legged squatting to facilitate strength gains of GMed and GMax. Additionally, the Swiss ball may be a useful adjunct to target gluteal muscle strengthening during single-legged squatting."
