        "Currently there is no cure for the progressive movement disorders associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Pharmacological management of movement disorders in PD are associated with significant negative side effects. Exercise improves the efficacy of anti-parkinsonian medication, but does not ameliorate the side effects. Consensus on the optimal mode of exercise training or dosing to improve motor function for individuals with PD is lacking. The new concept of forced exercise is gaining traction in the literature as a mode of exercise which has the potential to improve motor function in individuals with PD. The purpose of this article is to review the effects of forced exercise on specific components of motor function that would help guide clinical decision making and exercise prescription for the PD patient population. Collectively, the evidence provided in this review suggests that forced exercise may be safely added as an ancillary therapy to the medical management of PD."
