Criterion validity, and interunit and between-day reliability of the FLEX for measuring barbell velocity during commonly used resistance training exercises. J Strength Cond Res 34(6): 1519-1524, 2020-The aim of this study was to assess the criterion validity, interunit reliability (accounting for technological and biological variance), and between-day reliability of a novel optic laser device (FLEX) for quantifying mean concentric velocity. To assess the validity against a three-dimensional motion capture system and interunit reliability with both technological and biological variation, 18 men and women completed repetitions at 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, and 100% of one repetition maximum in the free-weight barbell back squat and bench press. To assess interunit (technological only) reliability, a purpose-built, calibrated rig completed a set protocol with 2 devices. To assess between-day reliability of the technology, the same protocol was repeated 21 days later. Standardized bias, typical error of the estimate (TEE; %), and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) were used to assess validity, whereas typical error and coefficient of variation (CV%) were calculated for reliability. Overall, TEE (\u00b190 CL) between the FLEX and criterion measure was 0.03 (\u00b10.004) and 0.04 (\u00b10.005) m\u00b7s in the back squat and bench press, respectively. For measures of reliability, overall interunit technological variance (CV% [\u00b1 90% confidence interval]) was 3.96% (3.83-4.12) but increased to 9.82% (9.31-10.41) and 9.83% (9.17-10.61) in the back squat and bench press, respectively, when biological variance was introduced. Finally, the overall between-day reliability was 3.77% (3.63-3.91). These findings demonstrate that the FLEX provides valid and reliable mean concentric velocity outputs across a range of velocities. Thus, practitioners can confidently implement this device for the monitoring and prescription of resistance training loads."
