      "AbstractText": [
        "Resistance training is an effective way to enhance strength in female youth but, to date, no researcher has meta-analysed its effect on muscular strength in that population.",
        "This meta-analysis characterised female youths' adaptability to resistance training (RT). A second objective was to highlight the limitations of the body of literature with a view to informing future research.",
        "Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science.",
        "Resistance training interventions in healthy females with a mean age between 8 and 18\u00a0years. Programmes of between 4 and 16\u00a0weeks' duration that included a control group.",
        "The inverse-variance random effects model for meta-analyses was used because it allocates a proportionate weight to trials based on the size of their individual standard errors and facilitates analysis whilst accounting for heterogeneity across studies. Effect sizes, calculated from a measure of muscular strength, are represented by the standardised mean difference and are presented alongside 95% confidence intervals.",
        "The magnitude of the main effect was 'small' (0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.85). Effect sizes were larger in older (>\u200915\u00a0years; ES\u2009=\u20090.72 [0.23-1.21] vs. 0.38 [-\u20090.02-0.79]), taller (>\u2009163\u00a0cm; ES\u2009=\u20090.67 [0.20-1.13] vs. 0.55 [0.08-1.02]) and heavier (<\u200954\u00a0kg; ES\u2009=\u20090.67 [0.30-1.03] vs. 0.53 [-\u20090.00-1.06]) participants.",
        "Resistance training is effective in female youth. These findings can be used to inform the prescription of RT in female youth."
