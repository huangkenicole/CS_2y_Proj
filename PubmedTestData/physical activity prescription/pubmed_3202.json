        "Two energy return prosthesis are subjected to three different statically applied loading methods. This initial study proposes that statically applied loading to a sport prosthesis using several controlled methods were statistically robust enough to derive a mechanical stiffness value. However, any predicted stiffness is drawn into question when allowing any movement of the distal end. This uncertainty will make any evaluation or prescription of lower limb prosthesis technology based upon their stiffness incorrect. In addition, the peak calculated stiffness at the expected bodyweight induced ground impact load of a runner is judged the most representative assessment method. This study attempts to build on previous research advocating the need to monitor the performance of prosthesis lower limb technology in disability sport."
