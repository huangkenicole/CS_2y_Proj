        "Exercise has beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome (MS). However, the exercise prescriptions that best support plasma glucose and lipid control remain unknown. We evaluated the effects of different combinations of aerobic and resistance training programs on plasma glucose and lipid metabolism and sleep quality in elderly MS patients. Eighty-five elderly MS patients were randomly assigned to five groups: aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), high aerobic with low resistance training (HALRT), high resistance with low aerobic training (HRLAT), or control. The exercise groups performed supervised moderate-intensity exercise during three 50-min sessions per week for 12 weeks. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), handgrip strength (HGS), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and sleep quality were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks. All intervention groups showed significant improvements in SBP, HGS, FPG, 2hPG, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores compared to baseline (all p < 0.05), while DBP, TC, TG, and LDL-C levels were significantly improved only in the HRLAT and HALRT groups (p < 0.05). The HALRT group showed the largest improvements in WC, SBP, DBP, HGS, FPG, 2hPG, and PSQI score (p < 0.001). The largest improvements in BMI, TC, and LDL-C were observed in the HRLAT group (p < 0.001). The combined exercise prescriptions were more effective than aerobic or resistance training alone at improving plasma glucose and lipid metabolism and sleep quality in elderly MS patients."
