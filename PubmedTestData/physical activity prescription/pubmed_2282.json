        "Exercise interventions may influence adverse effects experienced during hospitalization for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Adherence to exercise interventions is challenging. This review aimed to synthesize the literature to identify exercise interventions implemented during hospitalization for HSCT, including intervention characteristics, adherence, barriers and facilitators, and behavior change techniques using the behavior change technique taxonomy. A review of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase was completed. The sample included 19 studies. Exercise interventions demonstrated heterogeneity in prescription components, definitions, measures, and reporting of adherence. Barriers and facilitators of adherence to exercise were reported infrequently. Behavior change techniques most frequently used in studies reporting adherence rates of \u226575% included instruction on how to perform the behavior, graded tasks, and adding objects to the environment. The heterogeneity in definitions and measures of adherence limit forming conclusions to identify barriers and facilitators and determine which behavior change techniques increase adherence to exercise during HSCT."
