        "The benefits of physical activity (PA) for older adults have been demonstrated in reduced prevalence of common chronic conditions, improved mental health, decreased cognitive decline, and reduced mortality rates. Less is understood concerning the health impacts of light-to-moderate intensity PA. The purpose of this study was to estimate light-to-moderate PA frequency levels-low (0-2 days/week), intermediate (3-4 days/week) and high (\u22655 days/week)-among AARP Medicare Supplement insureds, identify characteristics, and estimate the association of PA levels with the prevalence of selected chronic conditions, health care utilization, and expenditures. In 2015, surveys were sent to a random sample of insureds. PA was determined from survey responses querying self-reported days per week of at least 30 minutes of light-to-moderate PA. Multivariate regression models, adjusting for confounding covariates and survey nonresponse bias, were utilized to determine the characteristics and association of intermediate and high PA levels with health outcomes. In a second analysis, results were stratified by age groups: 65-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years. Among survey respondents (n\u2009=\u200917,676), 23.3%, 33.9%, and 42.9% engaged in low, intermediate, and high PA, respectively. The strongest predictors of intermediate and high PA included being male, younger, self-reporting better health, using fewer prescription drugs, and being less likely to be diagnosed with common chronic conditions or depression. Those engaged in intermediate and high PA, overall and across age groups, had significantly lower health care utilization and expenditures and lower prevalence of most chronic conditions. Efforts to increase intermediate and high levels of PA among older adults should be encouraged."
