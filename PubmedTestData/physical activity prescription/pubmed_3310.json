        "The most significant clinical challenges in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are decline in CD4+ T helper cells and abnormal weight reduction. Consequently, PLWHA who are on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) or Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) are usually predisposed to coronary artery diseases due to abnormal weight gain (lipohypertrophy), though with improved and unstable Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts.The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of 6\u200aweeks progressive resistance exercise (PRE) and moderate intensity aerobic exercise (MIAE) on CD4 count, and weight of PLWHA in Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Ebonyi State.",
        "The study adopted quasi experimental research design. The population of the study was 60\u200aHuman Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome patients that attended HIV clinics at Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (AE-FUTHA) which formed 58 sample sizes for this study.Simple random sampling technique was adopted for the study and flow cytometry, Heel Densitometer (X-rite 331C), and Omron BF 400 were the instrument used for data collection of CD4 counts and weight respectively; and they are standardized hence not validated. Mean, standard deviation and Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA) were used to analyze the data obtained. The reliability coefficient obtained from the pilot study was 0.848 and 0.994 for CD4 and WEIGHT respectively.",
        "The major findings revealed a significant difference after 6 weeks' PRE and MIAE on CD4 and Weight of PLWHA.",
        "Health promotion policy maker's arm of the government and Healthcare givers should integrate and enforce the use of exercises either as a single regimen or combined exercises into the management plan of PLWHA for greater boost in absolute CD4 count bearing in mind that both have positive effects. Physiotherapist should be integrated in the managements of PLWHA for appropriate prescription and education of therapeutic exercises for body weight."
