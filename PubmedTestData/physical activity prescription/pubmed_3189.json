        "Background Given the importance of anxiety and quality of life for the mental health of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), exercise prescription can be of crucial significance. The present study aims to explore the effect of concurrent resistance-aerobic training on serum cortisol level, anxiety, and quality of life among pediatric T1D. Methods Forty children (aged 8-14 years) were randomly assigned to experimental (n\u2009=\u200920) and control groups (n\u2009=\u200920) for 16 weeks. The exercise training program was composed of 16 weeks of interval concurrent resistance-aerobic training with a duration of 60 min performed three times a week. The subjects first performed the resistance training (20 min of Pilates exercises and 20 min of body weight-bearing exercises). Then, the aerobic exercises were performed with an intensity of 50-75% of maximum heart rate. Before and after the training, blood tests including cortisol were carried out on the subjects by RIA kit. Anxiety and quality of life were measured by the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL), respectively. Body composition was measured by InBody. Data were analyzed by paired and independent t-test at p\u2009<\u20090.05 significance level. Results Sixteen weeks of concurrent resistance-aerobic exercise significantly reduced the anxiety index (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and increased the quality of life (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Although the cortisol index was increased, it did not reveal any significant differences between the experimental and control groups (p\u2009=\u20090.781). No significant differences were observed in the indices of quality of life, anxiety, and cortisol in the control group. Conclusions A 16-week program of concurrent resistance-aerobic training can improve the quality of life and anxiety among children suffering from T1D, but it may not influence the cortisol level (p\u2009>\u20090.05)."
