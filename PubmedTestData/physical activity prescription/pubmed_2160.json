        "Push-ups represent one of the simplest and most popular strengthening exercise. The aim of this study was to systematically review and critically appraise the literature on the kinetics-related characteristics of different types of push-ups, with the objective of optimising training prescription and exercise-related load. A systematic search was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct up to April 2018. Studies that reported kinetic data (e.g. initial and peak-force supported by the upper-limbs, impact-force, peak-flexion-moment of the elbow-joint, rate of propulsive- and impact-, and vertebral-joint compressive-forces) related to push-ups and included trained, recreational and untrained participants, were considered. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme scale. From 5290 articles retrieved in the initial search, only 26 studies were included in this review. Kinetic data for 46 push-up variants were assessed. A limitation of the current review is that the relationship between our findings and actual clinical or practical consequences is not statistically proven but can only be inferred from our critical descriptive approach. Overall, this review provides detailed data on specific characteristics and intensities of push-up variations, in order to optimise exercise prescription for training and rehabilitation purposes."
