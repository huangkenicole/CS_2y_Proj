        "Recurrent diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are associated with poor health-related quality of life and reduced mobility. Current guidelines recommend application of non-removable offloading devices (NROLDs) as they may improve the healing of DFUs, but there is a lack of information on the wider effects of wearing these devices. Few studies have examined the impact of NROLDs on holistic wellbeing or physical activity. We aimed to investigate the short-term impact of NROLDs on physical activity and DFU-related quality of life (DFU-QoL) in a small sample of community-dwelling people with recurrent DFUs.",
        "We measured DFU-QoL and physical activity (GPAQ) in people with DFUs, recruited from a single clinic before NROLD application, and at three and six weeks after device fitting. Participants were aged from 39-81 years (mean 58.4\u00b110.1 years) with an equal number of male and female participants.",
        "The study cohort comprised 18 participants, of whom 14 (78%) completed six-week questionnaires. Although there was some interim decline observed within individual domains of the DFU-QoL (financial: mean difference (MD) 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1, 30.2); p=0.03); non-compliance: MD 12.5 (95% CI-0.2, 25.2); p=0.05), no differences were observed over six weeks. Levels of physical activity declined over time, with over half (56%) of participants classified as having low levels of physical activity at baseline, rising to two-thirds (67%) at follow-up.",
        "Future studies should explore the longer-term holistic impact of NROLDs and develop more personalised approaches to care at the point of prescription, during and post-device use."
