      "AbstractText": [
        "Kai-Xin-San (KXS, or Happy Feeling Powder), a typical Chinese herbal prescription, is frequently used for treating depression by the multi-level and multi-target mechanism.",
        "To systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of KXS on depression in preclinic trials.",
        "We independently searched for preclinical animal studies of KXS on depression from inception to June 28, 2022, using electronic databases, e.g., PUBMED. The measurements were performed to assess the outcomes of behavioral tests.",
        "This systematic review and meta-analysis included twenty-four studies and 608 animals. A remarkable effect of KXS in depression behavioral tests, including sucrose consumption test (SMD: 2.36, 95% CI: (1.81, 2.90); Z\u00a0=\u00a08.49, P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001)., forced swimming test (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-60.52, 95% CI: (-89.04, -31.99); Z\u00a0=\u00a04.16, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), rearing times (MD=4.48, 95% CI: (3.39, 5.57); Z\u00a0=\u00a08.05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) and crossing times (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-33.7, 95% CI: (25.74, 41.67); Z\u00a0=\u00a08.29, P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) in the open field test, showing KXS's excellent efficiency in improving depressive-like symptoms of animals.",
        "Our meta-analysis showed KXS remarkably relieved animals' depressive-like symptoms, providing evidence that KXS can be a promising drug candidate for depression treatment."
