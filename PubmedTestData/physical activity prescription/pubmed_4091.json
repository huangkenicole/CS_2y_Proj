        "Physical activity improves insulin resistance, inhibits inflammation, and decreases the incidence of cardiovascular disease. These are major causes of death in patients with diabetes.",
        "The Taiwan National Health Interview Survey collected baseline characteristics of socioeconomic level, education, marriage, and health behaviour, including leisure time physical activity in 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013. The National Health Insurance research dataset 2000-2016 contained detailed information on medical conditions, including all comorbidities. All-cause and cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by the National Death Registry.",
        "A total of 4859 adults with type 2 diabetes were included in the analysis; 2389 (49 %) were men and the mean\u00b1SD age was 60\u00b113 years. Kaplan-Meier curve of all-cause (log-rank P<0.001) and cardiovascular death (log-rank P=0.038) categorized by leisure-time physical activity showed a significant difference. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that those who had more leisure time physical activity had a significantly lower risk of all-cause death than those with no physical activity (physical activity of 1-800 MET-min/week HR\u00a0=\u00a00.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.81, physical activity of >800 MET-min/week HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.81). A significant trend was also observed (P <0.001). Similar results were also observed for cardiovascular mortality (physical activity of 1-800 MET-min/week HR\u00a0=\u00a00.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.84, physical activity of >800 MET-min/week HR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95% CI: 0.55-1.13).",
        "For those with diabetes, increased leisure-time physical activity significantly reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. Further research is warranted to determine the proper prescription for physical activity to prolong healthy life."
