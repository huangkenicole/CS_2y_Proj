        "Strenuous endurance exercise induces transient functional and biochemical cardiac perturbations that persist for 24-48\u00a0h. The magnitude and time-course of exercise-induced reductions in ventricular function and increases in cardiac injury markers are influenced by the intensity and duration of exercise. In a human experimental model, exercise-induced reductions in ventricular strain and increases in cardiac troponin are greater, and persist for longer, when exercise is performed within the heavy- compared to moderate-intensity exercise domain, despite matching for total mechanical work. The results of the present study help us better understand the dose-response relationship between endurance exercise and acute cardiac stress/injury, a finding that has implications for the prescription of day-to-day endurance exercise regimes.",
        "Strenuous endurance exercise induces transient cardiac perturbations with ambiguous health outcomes. The present study investigated the magnitude and time-course of exercise-induced functional and biochemical cardiac perturbations by manipulating the exercise intensity-duration matrix. Echocardiograph-derived left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), and serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnI) concentration, were examined in 10 males (age: 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years; V\u0307O2, peak : 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0l\u00a0min(-1) ) before, throughout (50%, 75% and 100%), and during recovery (1, 3, 6 and 24\u00a0h) from two exercise trials. The two exercise trials consisted of 90 and 120\u00a0min of heavy- and moderate-intensity cycling, respectively, with total mechanical work matched. LVGLS decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during the 90\u00a0min trial only, with reductions peaking at 1\u00a0h post (pre: -19.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%; 1\u00a0h post: -18.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%) and persisting for >24\u00a0h into recovery. RVGLS decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) during both exercise trials with reductions in the 90\u00a0min trial peaking at 1\u00a0h post (pre: -27.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%; 1\u00a0h post: -25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%) and persisting for >24\u00a0h into recovery. Serum hs-cTnI increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during both exercise trials, with concentrations peaking at 3\u00a0h post but only exceeding cardio-healthy reference limits (14\u00a0ng\u00a0l(-1) ) in the 90\u00a0min trial (pre: 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0ng\u00a0l(-1) ; 3\u00a0h post: 25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0ng\u00a0l(-1) ). Exercise-induced reductions in ventricular strain and increases in cardiac injury markers persist for 24\u00a0h following exercise that is typical of day-to-day endurance exercise training; however, the magnitude and time-course of this response can be altered by manipulating the intensity-duration matrix."
