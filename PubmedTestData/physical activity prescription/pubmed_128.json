      "AbstractText": [
        "Worldwide health policies are trying to implement physical activity on prescription (PAP) at healthcare settings. However, there is not a proper methodology to analyze PHC organizational staff factors. This study aims to validate two questionnaires to assess the self-perception of nurses and general practitioners to implement PAP at primary healthcare (PHC) settings. The designed choice-modeling Google-form questionnaire was sent to 11 expert nurses and 11 expert sports medicine physicians. Experts evaluated each question on a 1-5 points Likert-type scale according to their expertise. Aiken's V coefficient values \u22650.75 were used to validate separately each question using the Visual Basic-6.0 software. A total of 10 sports medicine physicians and 10 nurses with 28.4 \u00b1 5.1 y and 16.3 \u00b1 11.8 y of PAP experience, respectively, validated the questionnaire. One expert in each group was not considered for offering 3 \u00b1 SD answers in \u22652 questions respect to the mean of the rest of experts. Final Aiken's V coefficient values were 0.89 (0.77-1.00) for the nurses' questionnaire and 0.84 (0.77-0.95) for the physicians' one. The questionnaires designed to assess the PAP self-perception of PHC nurses and physicians were validated. This methodology could be used to analyze PHC organizational staff factors in order to achieve an efficient PAP implementation in other PHC contexts."
