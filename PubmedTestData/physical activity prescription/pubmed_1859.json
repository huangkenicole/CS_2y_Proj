        "The detailed physiological consequences of aerobic training, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), are not well understood. In athletes and nonathletes with HCM, there are two hypothetical concerns with respect to exercise: exercise-related worsening of the phenotype (e.g., promoting hypertrophy and fibrosis) and/or triggering of arrhythmia. The former concern is unproven and animal studies suggest an opposite effect, where exercise has been shown to be protective. The main reason for exercise restriction in HCM is fear of exercise-induced arrhythmia. Although the safety of sports in HCM has been reviewed, even more recent data suggest a substantially lower risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in HCM than previously thought, and there is an ongoing debate about restrictions of exercise imposed on individuals with HCM. This review outlines the pathophysiology of HCM, the impact of acute and chronic exercise (and variations of exercise intensity, modality, and athletic phenotype) in HCM including changes in autonomic function, blood pressure, cardiac dimensions and function, and cardiac output, and the underlying mechanisms that may trigger exercise-induced lethal arrhythmias. It provides a critical evaluation of the evidence regarding risk of SCD in athletes and the potential benefits of targeted exercise prescription in adults with HCM. Finally, it provides considerations for personalized recommendations for sports participation based on the available data."
