        "The percentages of heart rate (%HRR) or oxygen uptake (%V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>R) reserve are used interchangeably for prescribing aerobic exercise intensity due to their assumed 1:1 relationship, although its validity is debated. This study aimed to assess if %HRR and %V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>R show a 1:1 relationship during steady-state exercise (SSE) and if exercise intensity and duration affect their relationship.",
        "Eight physically active males (age 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 years) were enrolled. Pre-exercise and maximal HR and V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> were assessed on the first day. In the following 4 days, different SSEs were performed (running) combining the following randomly assigned durations and intensities: 15 min, 45 min, 60% HRR, 80% HRR. Post-exercise maximal HR and V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> were assessed after each SSE. Using pre-exercise and post-exercise maximal values, the average HR and V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> of the last 5 min of each SSE were converted into percentages of the reserves (%RES), which were computed in a 3-way RM-ANOVA (<i>\u03b1</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.05) to assess if they were affected by the prescription parameter (HRR or V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>R), exercise intensity (60% or 80% HRR), and duration (15 or 45 min).",
        "The %RES values were not affected by the prescription parameter (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.056) or its interactions with intensity (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.319) or duration and intensity (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.117), while parameter and duration interaction was significant (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.009). %HRRs and %V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>Rs did not differ in the 15-min SSEs (mean difference [MD] = 0.7 percentage points, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.717), whereas %HRR was higher than %V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>R in the 45-min SSEs (MD = 6.7 percentage points, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.009).",
        "SSE duration affects the %HRR-%V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>R relationship, with %HRRs higher than %V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>Rs in SSEs of longer duration."
