        "Sildenafil (Viagra), an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5, has a powerful vasodilatory effect on the corpus cavernosa. An evaluation of coronary risk is necessary before its prescription in order to answer two questions: does taking this drug expose the patient to any special risk? Does the return to sexual activity itself carry any risk? Sildenafil is associated with a slight decrease in systolic (10 mmHg) and diastolic (7 mmHg) blood pressure which does not seem to be accentuated by the concommittant use of antihypertensive drugs. The co-administration of nitrate derivatives (before or after taking sildenafil) causes potentially dangerous falls in blood pressure (on average 40 mmHg for the systolic blood pressure). Co-administration of sildenafil and NO-donors is formally contra-indicated. The safety of sildenafil has been shown to be satisfactory in clinical trials: in particular, the risk of myocardial infarction is no greater in treated patients. Sexual activity is a generally moderately intense physical exercise and only rarely causes myocardial infarction. In practice, in patients without known coronary artery disease, the clinical history should be sufficient to determine whether the return of sexual relations is possible without risk. In known cardiac patients, sildenafil is contra-indicated in unstable situations; in stable coronary disease, it would seem wise to take advantage of the annual exercise stress testing to make sure of the absence of ischaemia on effort. In all cases, the patient must be warned that co-administration of nitrate derivatives is an absolure contra-indication to sildenafil treatment."
