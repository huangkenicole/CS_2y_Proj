      "AbstractText": [
        "This study systematically reviewed all human longitudinal exercise interventions that reported changes in the gut microbiota; frequency, intensity, duration and type of exercise were assessed to determine the influence of these variables on changes to the gut microbiota in both healthy individuals and clinical populations (PROPERO registration: CRD42022309854). Using PRISMA guidelines, trials analysing gut microbiota change with exercise interventions were included independent of trial randomisation, population, trial duration or analysis technique. Studies were excluded when microbiota abundance was not reported or when exercise was combined with other interventions. Twenty-eight trials were included, of which twelve involved healthy populations only and sixteen involved mixed or clinical-only populations. The findings show that participation in exercise of moderate to high-intensity for 30-90 min \u22653 times per week (or between 150-270 min per week) for \u22658 weeks is likely to produce changes in the gut microbiota. Exercise appears to be effective in modifying the gut microbiota in both clinical and healthy populations. A more robust methodology is needed in future studies to improve the certainty of the evidence."
