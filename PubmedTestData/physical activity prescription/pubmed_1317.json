        "High cholesterol is a preventable risk factor for heart disease. This study examines which aspects of patient-provider communication are associated with patient report of increased adherence to cholesterol management advice in a diverse, low-income patient population accessing the health care safety net, using the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. Patient-provider communication measures included patient report of: how often a provider listened carefully, gave easy-to-understand information, knew important information about the patient's medical history, showed respect, and spent enough time with the patient. Outcome measures were patient report of following provider advice to eat fewer high fat or high cholesterol foods, manage weight, increase physical activity, or take prescribed medicine. In adjusted analyses, when patients perceived their provider always knew their medical history, patients were more likely to report taking prescribed medication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6, 6.6). Knowledge of medical history (aOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.8), spending enough time (aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.4), and providing easily understandable information (aOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 4.7) were significantly associated with report of following physical activity advice. Knowledge of medical history (aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 5.2) and providing easily understandable information (aOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.4, 7.9) were significantly associated with report of following weight management advice. This study indicates different components of patient-provider communication influence patient adherence to lifestyle modification advice and medication prescription. These results suggest a tailored approach to optimize the impact of patient-provider communication on cholesterol management advice adherence."
