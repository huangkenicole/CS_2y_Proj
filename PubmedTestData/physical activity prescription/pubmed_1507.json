      "AbstractText": [
        "The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, safety, adherence, and preliminary efficacy of the ATOPE program during radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CT) for women with breast cancer.",
        "This single-blind, pretest-posttest feasibility study included 38 women with breast cancer at the beginning of their treatment. The ATOPE program consisted of 12 to 18 sessions of a multimodal physical exercise program, prescribed based on daily heart rate variability and clinimetric assessments using the ATOPE+ mHealth system. Overall health was assessed with quality of life, autonomous balance, and body composition, whereas health-related fitness was measured through functional capacity, physical activity levels, and upper and lower limb strength.",
        "The rates of recruitment, retention, and adherence were 52.35, 73.68, and 84.37%, respectively, and the satisfaction rating was 9.2 out of a possible 10 points. The perceived health status change score was 3.83 points, scored on a\u2009-5 to 5 point scale. No adverse effects were found. Compliance results showed that the ATOPE+ mHealth system was used on 73.38% of the days, and the Fitbit bracelet (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used on 84.91% of the days. Women stayed physically active 55% of days. Regarding preliminary results, for overall health, the percentage of body fat in the RT group decreased by 1.93%, whereas it increased by 5.03% in the CT group. Lower limb strength increased in the RT group, specifically knee extensor isometric strength (6.07%), isokinetic knee flexors 180 degree/second (1.53%), and isokinetic knee extensors 300 degree/second (4.53%), in contrast with the reductions found in the CT group (11.07, 18.67, and 14.89%, respectively).",
        "The ATOPE program, through nonlinear prescription based on daily monitoring with the ATOPE+ mHealth system, is feasible and safe for application during breast cancer treatment. The results suggest that the overall health can be maintained or even improved regarding most variables.",
        "This study focused on the feasibility, safety, and completion of a physical therapist-led program at early diagnosis for adults with breast cancer. The multimodal, supervised, tailored, nonlinear physical exercise program is feasible and safe, showed a good completion rate, and was able to prevent the quality-of-life deficits that are often triggered by systemic breast cancer treatment. This study highlights the importance of daily morning assessments using the ATOPE+ mHealth system in patients with breast cancer to prescribe nonlinear physical exercise."
