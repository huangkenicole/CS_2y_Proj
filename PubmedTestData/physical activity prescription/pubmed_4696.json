        "Hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, continues to challenge health professionals. There are too many patients with uncontrolled hypertension who end up with life altering or life ending complications. Over the years so much hypertension research has been conducted; and numerous effective antihypertensive drugs have been discovered and yet the rate of blood pressure control remains unacceptably low. It is high time that we focused our attention on the optimal use of the available knowledge and medications. More emphasis on teaching the patients and the public at large is required and patients need to have full trust of their health care providers in order to adhere to the prescriptions provided. If patients take their medications as prescribed and follow therapeutic lifestyle changes like physical activity and calorie and salt restrictions, there would be very few patients with uncontrolled hypertension and its complications."
