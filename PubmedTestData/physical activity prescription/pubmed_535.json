        "To examine the association between accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in breast cancer survivors (BCS) compared with age-matched healthy controls, and differences in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) cut-points.",
        "Using a case-control design, 19 BCS and 19 age-matched women completed 6\u00a0min of resting energy expenditure and 6-min periods of treadmill walking in Midwestern United States. Accelerometers and an open-circuit spirometry system were used to measure activity counts and energy expenditure (VO<sub>2</sub> ). A mixed-factor analysis of variance was conducted on activity counts and VO<sub>2</sub> . Independent samples t tests compared the magnitude of associations between groups.",
        "There were group by speed interactions on energy expenditure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and counts (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The linear association did not differ between BCS and controls for the R<sup>2</sup> (p\u00a0=\u00a00.62) nor the slope (p\u00a0=\u00a00.43), but there was a difference in the intercept (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). This resulted in different MVPA cut-points between groups: 1,439\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0761 counts\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> in BCS and 1,937\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0639 counts\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> in controls.",
        "The findings support the use of different cut-points to quantify time spent in MVPA for BCS. Application of these cut-points is warranted to accurately assess physical activity (PA) patterns for better prescription and health outcomes in PA programmes for BCS."
