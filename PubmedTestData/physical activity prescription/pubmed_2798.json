      "AbstractText": [
        "There is an increasing consensus that exercise is a medicine and that regular exercise can effectively improve and prevent metabolic diseases such as diabetes. Islet cells are the endocrine of the pancreas and vital to the development of diabetes. Decades of developmental research in exercise intervention and the health of islet cells confirmed that exercise exerts beneficial effects on the function, proliferation, and survival rate of islet cells. However, the precise exercise reference scheme is still elusive. To accomplish this goal, we searched and analyzed relevant articles, and concluded the precise exercise prescription treatments for various species such as humans, rats, and mice. Each exercise protocol is shown in the tables below. These exercise protocols form a rich pipeline of therapeutic development for exercise on the health of islet cells."
