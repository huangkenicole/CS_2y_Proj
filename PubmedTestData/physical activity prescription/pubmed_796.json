        "The primary objective of this systematic review was to synthesise peer-reviewed quantitative research of outcomes associated with participation in parkrun. The secondary objective was to synthesise the quantitative research of factors influencing why, and how often, individuals participate in parkrun. Studies were identified via electronic search of Medline, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Informit, PsychInfo, SportDiscus, and Web of Science, to 30 March 2021. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality. Eleven studies (18,203 participants) were included. Limited evidence from pre-post measure single-group prospective studies suggests parkrun participation promotes improvements in fitness, body mass index, physical activity levels, mood, and personal wellbeing. Individuals with non-running backgrounds generally had higher levels of participation. The main motivators to participate were to improve fitness and social interaction. Future attendance was most strongly correlated with historical attendance. There is a small evidence base for improvements in broad measures of physical and mental health from participation in parkrun. In addition, the study found improving physical fitness and social wellbeing were the main self-reported factors for participation in parkrun. Further research is needed to strengthen the knowledge base of the effects of parkrun to determine its efficacy as a health intervention strategy for physical and mental health."
