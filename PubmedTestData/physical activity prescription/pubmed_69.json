      "AbstractText": [
        "Physical activity (PA) can be used to prevent and treat diseases. In Sweden, licensed healthcare professionals use PA on prescription (PAP) to support patients to increase their PA level. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate a 2-year intervention of two different strategies of PAP treatment for patients with insufficient PA level, after a previous 6-month period of ordinary PAP treatment in a primary health care setting.",
        "We included 190 patients, 27-77\u2009years, physically inactive with metabolic risk factors where the patients were not responding to a previous 6-month PAP treatment with increased PA. The patients were randomized to either enhanced support from a physiotherapist (PT group) or continued ordinary PAP treatment at the health care centre (HCC group). The PAP treatment included an individualized dialogue; an individually dosed PA recommendation, including a written prescription; and a structured follow-up. In addition to PAP, the PT group received aerobic fitness tests and more frequent scheduled follow-ups. The patient PA level, metabolic health, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured at baseline and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.",
        "At the 2-year follow-up, 62.9% of the PT group and 50.8% of the HCC group had increased their PA level and 31.4% vs. 38.5% achieved \u2265\u2009150\u2009min of moderate-intensity PA/week (difference between groups n.s.). Over 2\u00a0years, both groups displayed increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (p\u2009=\u20090.004 vs. baseline), increased mental health status (MCS) (p\u2009=\u20090.036), and reduced body mass index (BMI) (p\u2009=\u20090.001), with no difference between groups.",
        "During long-term PAP interventions, the PA level, metabolic health, and HRQOL increased in patients at metabolic risk without significant differences between groups. The results indicate to be independent of any changes in pharmacological treatment. We demonstrated that the PAP treatment was feasible in ordinary primary care. Both the patients and the healthcare system benefitted from the improvement in metabolic risk factors. Future studies should elucidate effective long-term PAP-treatment strategies.",
