        "Heat sensitivity (HS) describes a temporary worsening of multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms with increased body temperature. The pathophysiology may relate to central nervous system conduction deficits and autonomic dysfunction. We conducted deep clinical phenotyping of a cohort of persons with MS to identify predictors of HS.",
        "We recruited 59 MS participants with HS or No HS. Participants self-reported symptom severity (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, and fatigue visual analog scale) and underwent maximal exercise and transcranial magnetic stimulation testing to characterize autonomic and corticospinal function. We examined associations with HS using binomial logistic regression.",
        "People with HS (36/59) had significantly greater disability, depression, fatigue, and physical and psychological functional effects of MS. They also had significantly lower corticospinal excitability but not conduction. After controlling for disease-modifying therapy (DMT), disability, and disease type, self-reported difficulty using hands in everyday tasks was significantly associated with a large increase in the odds of HS. Autonomic and corticospinal dysfunction were not associated with HS. Lack of DMT use alone was also associated with a large increase in the odds of HS.",
        "Following a comprehensive assessment of plausible contributors to HS, HS was most strongly associated with lack of a DMT prescription and self-reported hand dysfunction. Surprisingly, objective measurement of autonomic and corticospinal integrity did not contribute to HS."
