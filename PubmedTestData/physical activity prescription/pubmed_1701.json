        "Lean mass abnormalities are highly prevalent in patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). As such, current guidelines recommend incorporating resistance exercise (RE) into the exercise prescription of Phase II-IV CR. The effects of RE on health-related outcomes in patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) have not been extensively investigated in comparison to aerobic exercise, the traditional modality of exercise implemented in CR. The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing prevalence of lean mass abnormalities such as dynapenia and sarcopenia in CVD and briefly outline the contributing pathophysiology of these impairments as potential targets for RE training. An update on the current evidence pertaining to the effects of RE on exercise capacity, skeletal muscle strength, body composition, CV health, and quality of life in CR patient populations is provided. The current recommendations for RE training in CR are discussed. Future directions for research and clinical practice in this field are highlighted, and included the need to identify the most efficacious principles of resistance training for different health related outcomes in CVD, as well as the suggested drive towards a 'personalized medicine' approach to exercise prescription in CR."
