        "Memory loss in older age affects women more than men and cardiovascular disease is a leading risk factor. Physical activity can improve memory in healthy older adults; however, few physical activity interventions have targeted women with cardiovascular disease, and none utilized lifestyle approaches.",
        "The purpose of this study was to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a 24-week lifestyle physical activity intervention (physical activity prescription, five group meetings, and nine motivational interviewing calls).",
        "A sequential mixed-methods approach was used. Participants were 18 sedentary women \u226565 years with cardiovascular disease and without cognitive impairment recruited in August 2017. Feasibility, acceptability, self-reported health, accelerometer-assessed physical activity, and neurocognitive memory tests were measured using a pre-post test design. Two post-intervention focus groups (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20098) were conducted in June 2018. Concept analysis was used to identify barriers/motivators of intervention participation.",
        "Meeting attendance was >72% and retention was 94%. Participants rated the program with high satisfaction. There were significant improvements at 24 weeks in self-rated physical health, objective daily steps, and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (<i>d</i>\u2009=\u2009.30-.64). Focus group themes generated recommendations for modifying the intervention.",
        "Findings support adapting the intervention further for women with cardiovascular disease and testing it in an efficacy trial."
