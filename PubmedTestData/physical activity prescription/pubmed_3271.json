        "In some countries, the microprocessor-controlled C-LEG knee joint is reimbursed by the national health insurance for transfemoral amputees under certain conditions. However, whether users really benefit from such a technology in their daily life is unknown.",
        "To observe the performance of active C-LEG users in terms of locomotor ability and activities, satisfaction and quality of life after 6 months of wearing the prosthesis in real-life conditions.",
        "This multicenter observational study investigated locomotor ability [Locomotor Capability Index 5 (LCI-5)], satisfaction [Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Device 2.0 (QUEST 2.0)] and quality of life [Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36)] at the beginning (T0) and end (T1) of the C-LEG test period and at 6 months (T2) after the confirmed prescription of the C-LEG. Information was also collected on the use of walking aids, daily wear of the prosthesis, falls and adverse events.",
        "We enrolled 102 participants; 81 were assessed at T1 (62 had a previous prosthesis) and 56 were followed up after 6 months (45 had a previous prosthesis). For participants who had previously been fitted with a prosthetic knee, which was mechanical in almost all cases, as compared with baseline, the use of C-LEG significantly improved locomotor ability (LCI-5 52.6 vs. 46.7, P<0.001), satisfaction (QUEST score 4.6 vs. 3.7, P<0.001) and physical quality of life (SF-36 physical component summary score 51.1 vs. 45.3, P<0.001). In addition, daily use of the prosthesis was higher and use of walking aids and frequency of falls were lower as compared with the previous period.",
        "Active transfemoral amputees with prescription of the C-LEG knee joint showed improved function, satisfaction and physical quality of life after 6 months of wear as compared with their previous prosthesis."
