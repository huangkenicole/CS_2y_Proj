      "AbstractText": [
        "Increasing lifestyle energy expenditure has long been advocated in the prevention and treatment of obesity, as embodied in the ancient prescription of Hippocrates (the 'father of modern medicine') that people with obesity should eat less and exercise more. However, the long-term outcome of exercise alone or in combination with dieting in obesity management is poor. To understand the reasons underlying these failures and to develop novel strategies that target lifestyle energy expenditure in both prevention and treatment of obesity, research over the past decades has focused on (i) the interactions between physical activity and body weight (and its composition) throughout the lifespan; (ii) the influence of biology and potential compensatory changes in energy expenditure, food intake and food assimilation in response to energy deficits; and (iii) the impact of the built environment (outdoor and indoor) and smart technology on physical activity behaviours, thermoregulatory thermogenesis and metabolic health. It is against this background that recent advances relevant to the theme of 'Targeting Lifestyle Energy Expenditure in the Management of Obesity and Health: From Biology to Built Environment' are addressed in this overview and the nine review articles in this supplement, reporting the proceedings of the 9th Fribourg Obesity Research Conference."
