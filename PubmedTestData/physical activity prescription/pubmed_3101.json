        "To compare the activity and walking pattern of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and control subjects during a 24-hour period.",

        "The average walking velocity, time spent in sitting, standing, and lying, and numbers of steps per 24\u00a0hours were measured in nine individuals with COPD and eight healthy control subjects.",
        "The average walking velocity in individuals with COPD was equivalent to that of the control subjects. Individuals with COPD walked significantly less than the control subjects. The total time spent sitting, standing, and walking was similar in the two groups.",
        "The results suggested that the walking velocity selected by individuals with COPD serves to minimize energy cost per distance.",
        "The study findings emphasize the need to maintain walking velocity in any exercise prescription for individuals with COPD."
