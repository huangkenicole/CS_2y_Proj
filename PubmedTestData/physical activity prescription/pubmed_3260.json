        "Age-related hyperkyphosis is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as falls, fractures, and mortality. However, few studies investigated the relationship between the severity of hyperkyphosis and physical endurance in older adults. This study examined whether a degree of hyperkyphosis curvature was independently associated with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance. We analyzed the baseline data of 112 older adults aged 60-92 enrolled in the Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) Kyphosis trial. The majority of the sample had at least a college degree and were white. On average, participants walked 503.9 (SD 82.3) meters in 6 minutes. Multivariate regression results showed that the degree of hyperkyphosis curvature was not independently associated with the 6MWT distance, but taller height, lighter weight, and less prescription medication were significant predictors of better performance on the 6MWT distance. Validation of the study findings in a large, diverse older adult population is warranted."
