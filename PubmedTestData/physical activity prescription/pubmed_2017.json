        "Under physical exercise conditions, muscles can synthetise and release myokines and these molecules can exert paracrine and endocrine actions. Females with obesity have a sedentary lifestyle with alterations in myokine levels.",
        "The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on myokine levels, anthropometric parameters, clinical data, impedance parameters, and muscle ultrasound data in sedentary females with obesity.",
        "Anthropometric data, muscle mass by ultrasound at the quadriceps level, myokine determination, and blood pressure were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks in 25 females with obesity. For 12 weeks, the physical exercise programme was prescribed through an online platform.",
        "After the physical exercise programme, there was a significant improvement in body mass index (-1.49\u00b10.1kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p=0.02), weight (-3.9\u00b10.7kg; p=0.01), waist circumference (-7.2\u00b10.2cm; p=0.01), skeletal muscle mass (5.4\u00b11.2kg; p=0.01), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (0.5\u00b10.1kg; p=0.02) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (1.4\u00b10.1kg; p=0.03), and a decrease in fat mass (-4.1\u00b10.2kg; p=0.01) and blood pressure. The ultrasound parameters of the anterior rectus quadriceps muscle improved significantly. The following biochemical parameters decreased; insulin levels (-66.3\u00b110.2pg/ml; p=0.04), HOMA-IR (-0.4\u00b10.1 units; p=0.03), apelin (-3.5\u00b10.2IU/l; p=0.04), FABP3 (-143.6\u00b138.1pg/ml; p=0.03), IL6 (-4.1\u00b10.02pg/ml; p=0.02), myostatin (-81.6\u00b118.1pg/ml; p=0.04), and FGF21 (-9.5\u00b11.1pg/ml; p=0.03).",
        "The prescription of physical exercise with an online platform for females with obesity decreases weight, body fat mass and increases muscle mass, producing a decrease in insulin resistance and some myokine levels."
