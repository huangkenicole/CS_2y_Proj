        "Stair navigation is an essential and demanding form of locomotion. During stair ascent and descent, persons with lower limb loss exhibit gait characteristics which may increase their risk of falls and joint degeneration of the intact limb. To reduce deviations from typically-able-bodied gait and overloading of the intact limb for this population, one potential intervention involves modifying passive prosthetic feet by incorporating a flexible toe joint that simulates the biological metatarsophalangeal joint. In this study, we aimed to assess the user preferences and biomechanical effects of a flexible prosthetic toe joint during stair ascent and descent for persons with unilateral lower-limb loss. Nine participants with unilateral lower-limb loss were recruited (Male; Medicare Functional Classification Level: eight K4, one K3; age: 41 \u00b1 11 years; mass: 95 \u00b1 13 kg; height: 1.84 \u00b1 0.05 m; mean \u00b1 SD). No significant changes in lower-limb joint mechanics were identified. Five of nine participants preferred the unmodified prosthesis with a standard carbon fiber keel for both stair ascent and descent. Varied user preferences and inconsistent changes in lower-limb joint parameters between participants highlight the importance of subject-specific analyses and individualized device prescription."
