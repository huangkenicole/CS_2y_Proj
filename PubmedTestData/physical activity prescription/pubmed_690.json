        "The rising incidence of non-communicable diseases in western countries is being driven by poor lifestyle choices, including increasingly inadequate physical activity. The aim of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of a physical activity primary care intervention named the 'Green Prescription' on changes in physical activity levels 2-3 year's following original prescription.",
        "A retrospective study design using a telephone interview.",
        "Physical activity and health information was gathered from participants in June-September 2015, who were originally prescribed a primary care physical activity intervention 2-3 years ago. Respondents were classified as either having completed the programme (adherence group, n\u00a0=\u00a091) or having not completed the programme (non-adherence group, n\u00a0=\u00a056).",
        "Participants who had completed the programme within the past 2-3\u00a0years reported an additional 64\u00a0min (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a016-110) of total physical activity per week compared to those who had dropped out. Forty-two percent of participants in the adherence group reported increased physical activity levels after receiving the Green Prescription compared to 29% in the non-adherence group. The adherence group were less likely to be sedentary (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.5-0.9) and more likely to meet the current physical activity guidelines of at least 150\u00a0min of physical activity per week (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.1, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.0-1.3).",
        "The findings indicate a long-term benefit is likely to participants who completed Green Prescription."
