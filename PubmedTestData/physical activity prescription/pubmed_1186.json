        "Standard assessment of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) prescription involves hospital-based clinical tests. However, there is some evidence suggesting that oxygen demand during daily activities may not be correctly estimated by such tests, when compared with continuous ambulatory oximetry. The authors describe the results of a study aiming to evaluate the clinical relevance of a home telemonitoring system in LTOT optimization.",
        "Thirty-five chronic respiratory failure patients were monitored in real time with an oximeter sensor and an accelerometer. Signals were sent via Bluetooth(\u00ae) (Bluetooth SIG, Kirkland, WA) to a mobile phone and then via 3G or general packet radio service to a server. Continuous and secure access to data was established through an Internet site.",
        "Each patient was monitored an average of 7.6 \u00b1 4.5 days (total, 83 \u00b1 67\u2009h). Valid records were on average 65 \u00b1 24%. Records of rest, activity, and sleep time per patient were, on average, 28 \u00b1 21%, 7 \u00b1 6%, and 59 \u00b1 25%, respectively. Significant desaturation during rest, activity, and sleep was found in 2, 26, and 9 patients, respectively. Patients' ratings of the user-friendliness of the equipments, assessed by questionnaire, were fairly good (76% reported it as easy/very easy).",
        "Our study suggests that a telemonitoring system combining oximetry and physical activity evaluation might contribute to a more adequate oxygen prescription, mainly during daily activities."
