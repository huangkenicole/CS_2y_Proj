        "Aerobic exercise prescription is often set at specific heart rate (HR) values. Previous studies demonstrated that during exercise carried out at a HR slightly above that corresponding to the gas exchange threshold (GET), work rate (WR) has to decrease in order to maintain HR constant. We hypothesized a greater WR decrease at a fixed HR after simulated microgravity/inactivity (bed rest, BR). Ten male volunteers (23\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yr) were tested before (PRE) and after (POST) a 10-day horizontal BR and performed on a cycle ergometer <i>1</i>) incremental exercise; <i>b</i>) 15-min HR<sub>CLAMPED</sub> exercise, in which WR was continuously adjusted to maintain a constant HR, corresponding to that at 120% of GET determined in PRE; <i>3</i>) two moderate-intensity constant WR (MOD) exercises. Breath-by-breath O<sub>2</sub> uptake (V\u0307o<sub>2</sub>), HR, and other variables were determined. After BR, peak V\u0307o<sub>2</sub> (V\u0307o<sub>2peak</sub>) and GET significantly decreased, by \u223c10%. During HR<sub>CLAMPED</sub> (145\u2009\u00b1\u200911 beats\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>), the decrease in WR needed to maintain a constant HR was greater in POST versus PRE (-39\u2009\u00b1\u200910% vs. -29\u2009\u00b1\u200914%, <i>P</i> < 0.01). In six subjects the decreased WR switched from the heavy- to the moderate-intensity domain. The decrease in WR during HR<sub>CLAMPED</sub>, in PRE versus POST, was significantly correlated with the V\u0307o<sub>2peak</sub> decrease (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.52; <i>P</i> = 0.02). A greater amplitude of the slow component of the HR kinetics was observed during MOD following BR. Exercise at a fixed HR is not associated with a specific WR or WR domain; the problem, affecting exercise evaluation and prescription, is greater after BR. The WR decrease during HR<sub>CLAMPED</sub> is a biomarker of exercise intolerance after BR.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> During a 15-min exercise carried out at a heart rate (HR) slightly above that corresponding to the gas exchange threshold, to keep HR constant work rate significantly decreased; the decrease was more pronounced after a 10-day horizontal bed rest. The work rate decrease at a fixed HR can be considered a systemic biomarker of exercise intolerance during microgravity/inactivity and could also be easily and reliably determined during spaceflights or in patients."
