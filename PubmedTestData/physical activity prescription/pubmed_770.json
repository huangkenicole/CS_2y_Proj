        "The concept of prenatal physical activity has transitioned from a potentially risky behaviour to a prescription to improve maternal-fetal health. Pregnant women who are hospitalized because of a complication should continue to engage in light activities of daily living given the known adverse effects of maternal bedrest. Because the amount physical activity performed by pregnant women while in hospital not been documented; we compared levels of physical activity between women who were and were not hospitalized during pregnancy. We found that hospitalized pregnant women self-impose bedrest even in the absence of a medical recommendation."
