        "To examine the effects of a 24-week lifestyle intervention prescribed by family doctors on carotid artery stiffness in metabolic syndrome (MS) subjects with pre-hypertension and/or pre-diabetes.",
        "Sixty-three middle-aged and older subjects with pre-hypertension and/or pre-diabetes were divided into subjects without MS (MS-) and with MS (MS+). MS components and carotid artery stiffness by ultrasound were determined at baseline, at 8 weeks, and following the 24 weeks of lifestyle intervention. Family doctors prescribed an individually customized lifestyle prescription for aerobic exercise and Mediterranean-style diet.",
        "Carotid artery distensibility significantly increased in MS+ following the 24 weeks of intervention compared with baseline (0.191+/-0.012 vs. 0.143+/-0.011, 1/mmHg x 10(-2), p<0.05). Similarly, beta stiffness index decreased in MS+ following the 24 weeks of intervention (9.8+/-1.1 vs. 12.5+/-1.1 AU, p<0.05). Following the intervention, waist circumference, BP and fasting glucose levels reduced in MS+ (all p<0.05), and 13 MS+ subjects were free from MS.",
        "The results show the reduction of carotid artery stiffness and the improvement of some MS components in MS subjects, suggesting a favorable effect of our lifestyle modification strategy on central artery stiffness as well as MS components in MS subjects."
