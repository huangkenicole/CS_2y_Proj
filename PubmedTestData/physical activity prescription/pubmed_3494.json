        "The aims of the study were two-fold: i) examine the validity and reliability of high-speed kicking actions using foot-mounted inertial measurement unit's (IMU), ii) quantify soccer players within-microcycle and inter-positional differences in both the frequency and speed of technical actions.",
        "During the in-season phase (25 weeks) of the UK domestic season, 21 professional soccer player ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index were analysed. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and confidence intervals were used to determine the validity between the systems, whilst a general linear mixed model analysis approach was used to establish estimated marginal mean values for total ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index.",
        "Good concurrent validity was observed for ball release velocity and high-speed kicks against a high-speed camera (r2- 0.96, CI 0.93-0.98). Ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index all showed main effects for fixture proximity (p>0.001), playing positions (p>0.001) and across different training categories (p>0.001). The greatest high-speed ball releases were observed on a match-day (MD)+1 (17.6 \u00b1 11.9; CI- 16.2 to 19) and MD-2 (16.8 \u00b1 15; CI- 14.9 to 18.7), with MD+1 exhibiting the highest number of ball releases (161.1 \u00b1 51.2; CI- 155.0 to 167.2) and ball release index (145.5 \u00b1 45.2; CI- 140.1 to 150.9) across all fixture proximities. Possessions (0.3 \u00b1 0.9; CI- 0.3 to 0.4) and small-sided games (1.4 \u00b1 1.6; CI- 1.4 to 1.5), had the lowest values for high-speed ball releases with technical (6.1 \u00b1 7.2; CI- 5.7 to 6.6) and tactical (10.0 \u00b1 10.5; CI- 6.9 to 13.1) drills showing the largest high-speed ball releases.",
        "The present study provides novel information regarding the quantification of technical actions of professional soccer players. Insights into absolute and relative frequency and intensity of releases in different drill types, provide practitioners with valuable information on technical outputs that can be manipulated during the process of planning training programmes to produce desired outcomes. Both volume and speed of ball release actions should be measured, when monitoring the technical actions in training according to fixture proximity, drill type and player position to permit enhanced training prescription."
