        "More importance has been placed on exercise training due to increase in the overweight and obese population. However, few studies have researched the effects of exercise training on the health capabilities and life satisfaction levels of overweight and obese African American women. This study sought to determine the effect of a 12-week exercise training on health capabilities and life satisfaction levels of overweight and obese African American women. Participants, who passed an initial screening and pre-assessment, were measured current health capabilities and life satisfaction levels both prior to, and following, the 12-week exercise training. The results from this study indicated an improvement in health capabilities, although with no significant differences following exercise training, while a significantly higher life satisfaction levels was observed among the overweight and obese African American women. The findings suggest that exercise training can be beneficial to enhance overweight and obese African American women's health capabilities and life satisfaction levels. Exercise professionals should provide the appropriate exercise trainings so that overweight and obese African American women can optimize life satisfaction levels."
