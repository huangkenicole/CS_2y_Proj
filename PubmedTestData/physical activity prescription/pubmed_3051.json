        "Sarcopenia, and high blood pressure are highly prevalent, preventable conditions that pose significant burden for older adults and on the healthcare system. Current prevention and treatment of high blood pressure in sarcopenia, by non-pharmacological approaches remain limited and are far from optimal. Clinical trials and mechanistic studies provide encouraging evidence of a plausible therapeutic effect of progressive resistance training (PRT) on blood pressure in younger, and pre-hypertensive and hypertensive older adults. The impact of PRT on blood pressure has not been empirically tested in older adults with sarcopenia. This pilot study aims to provide effect size confidence intervals, clinical trial and intervention feasibility data, and procedural materials for a full-scale randomized controlled trial that will determine the efficacy of PRT intervention as a therapeutic strategy for blood pressure control in older adults with sarcopenia. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a090) will be randomized to receive exercise educational materials or the PRT intervention consisting of 24 supervised exercise sessions over 12-weeks. Follow-up assessments will occur at 12-weeks and one-year later. The primary outcome is systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, analyzed separately. Microvascular mechanisms linking muscle (perfusion, strength, function) to changes in blood pressure will be explored at baseline and 12-weeks. This study will provide new evidence for the therapeutic effect of PRT as a non-pharmacological strategy for improving blood pressure. Insights gained may also inform of the potential role of muscle strength as a novel target for blood pressure control, and future exercise prescription guidelines related to muscle strengthening in high-risk older adults."
