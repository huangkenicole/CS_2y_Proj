        "Whiplash-associated disorders have been the subject of much attention in the scientific literature and remain a major public health problem.",
        "Measure the impact of a validated information booklet on the fear-avoidance beliefs of emergency physicians and their approach to management regarding the treatment of whiplash-associated disorders.",
        "A prospective cluster randomized controlled study conducted with a sample of emergency medicine physicians. Fear-avoidance beliefs were measured using The Whiplash Belief Questionnaire (WBQ) and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). We assessed the approach to management based on the prescription of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments based on the advice given to patients. The validated information booklet was the French version of The Whiplash Book. A set of questionnaires was sent to participants pre- and post-intervention. The experimental intervention was the provision of The Whiplash Book. The control arm did not receive any training or information.",
        "Mean fears and beliefs scores on inclusion were high: WBQ = 19.09 (\u00b1 4.06); physical activity FABQ = 11.45 (\u00b1 4.73); work FABQ = 13.85 (\u00b1 6.70). Improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs scores being greater in the intervention group was further confirmed by the variation in WBQ (-20 [-32; -6] vs. -6 [-16; 9]; p = 0.06), physical activity FABQ (-70 [-86; -50] vs. -15 [-40; 11]; p < 0.001), and work FABQ (-40 [-71; 0] vs. 0 [-31; 50]; p = 0.02). The emergency physicians' initial approach to management was not consistent with current guidelines. Reading the French version of The Whiplash Book could contribute to changing their approach to management in several areas on intra-group analysis.",
        "The French version of The Whiplash Book positively influenced fear-avoidance beliefs among emergency physicians."
