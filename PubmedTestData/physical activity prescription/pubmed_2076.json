      "AbstractText": [
        "Heart rate reserve (HRR) is used to guide exercise training in patients with cardiovascular disease, primarily as a surrogate for oxygen uptake reserve (VO<inf>2</inf>R) as a marker of metabolic demand. However, the relationship between HRR and VO<inf>2</inf>R in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not well described. We aimed to assess the validity of HRR as a surrogate for VO<inf>2</inf>R to guide exercise intensity in AF patients.",
        "One hundred one patients with non-permanent AF undertaking a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were prospectively enrolled. HR and VO<inf>2</inf> values were recorded throughout exercise to determine HRR and VO<inf>2</inf>R at each workload. Linear regression was used to calculate the slope and y-intercept for HRR versus VO<inf>2</inf>R with an equivalent slope defined as 1 and y-intercept of 0. The impact of rhythm during exercise, beta blockers and chronotropic incompetence (CI) on the HRR-VO<inf>2</inf>R relationship was also assessed.",
        "The slope of HRR-VO<inf>2</inf>R was 0.79\u00b10.4, indicating a significant difference from an assumed slope of 1.0 (mean difference: -0.21, 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.12, P<0.001). The mean y-intercept slope was 20.1\u00b141.6, differing significantly from 0 (mean difference: 20.1, 95% CI: 11.9-28.3, P<0.001). The presence of AF during CPET, beta-blockers or chronotropic incompetence did not independently alter the association between VO<inf>2</inf>R and HRR.",
        "HRR is not equivalent to VO<inf>2</inf>R in AF patients. There was no significant effect of rhythm status, chronotropic incompetence or beta-blockers on this relationship. These findings highlight that the HR prescription of exercise intensity in AF patients should be guided by an individualised HRR-VO<inf>2</inf>R relationship."
