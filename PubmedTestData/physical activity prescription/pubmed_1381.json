        "Despite endorsement by various health organizations, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of perceptually regulated exercise training (PRET) as a method of exercise intensity prescription. The purpose of this study was to confirm the efficacy of an 8-wk PRET program clamped at RPE13 to improve aerobic fitness and cardiovascular health. The affective response to this method of exercise prescription was also assessed.",
        "Sedentary volunteers (age = 34.3 \u00b1 13.0 yr, weight = 72.5 \u00b1 13.7 kg, height = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 m) were randomly assigned to either a training (n = 16) or a control (n = 10) group. All participants completed a graded exercise test to determine aerobic capacity at baseline and after the intervention. Participants allocated to the training group performed 30 min of PRET at RPE13 on the Borg 6-20 RPE Scale on three occasions per week for 8 wk. Affective valence was measured using the Feeling Scale.",
        "The RPE-regulated training resulted in improvements (P < 0.01) in V\u02d9O(2max), mean arterial pressure, total cholesterol, and body mass index in the training group across time. During training at RPE13, V\u02d9O(2) increased (P < 0.01) from week 1 (19.2 \u00b1 1.1 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min) to week 8 (23.4 \u00b1 1.1 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min). On average, affect was positive and stable throughout training (3.4 \u00b1 1.2). Affect measured at RPE13 in the baseline and postintervention graded exercise tests increased in the training group (3.1 \u00b1 .9 to 3.7 \u00b1 1.1, P < 0.05), whereas it decreased in the control group (2.8 \u00b1 1.1 to 2.6 \u00b1 1).",
        "Sedentary individuals were able to use PRET at RPE13 to improve their cardiovascular health and fitness, and on average, the exercise intensities selected were perceived to feel pleasant."
