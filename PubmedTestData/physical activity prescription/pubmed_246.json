        "Being sedentary is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection, suggesting the important role physical activity (PA) has as a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19 outcome.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate NCHD's exercise prescribing practices and establish how these related to their knowledge, attitudes, and demographics and if their practices had changed since the COVID-19 pandemic began.",
        "An online survey was emailed to NCHDs working in city centre teaching hospitals in southern Ireland. Using a combination of forced choice items and five-point Likert scales, questions examined NCHD's knowledge, attitudes, and practices of exercise prescription.",
        "For education, 30% of participants were able to correctly answer both WHO PA guidelines. 10% agreed that they knew where to refer patients for specialist exercise programs. For attitudes, 100% of participants in this study agreed that PA played a role in the prevention of disease. For practices, 36% of participants did not prescribe exercise at all. No participant strongly agreed with being confident in prescribing exercises. 90% did not increase their exercise prescribing practices since the introduction of pandemic restrictions.",
        "Despite an overall positive attitude towards PA in this study, findings suggest exercise prescribing was not carried out regularly amongst the majority of participants. There was a lack of confidence and knowledge regarding exercise prescribing amongst NCHDs. The majority of NCHDs have not changed their exercise prescribing practices since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Findings suggest there is an urgent need for educational tools and supports to assist doctors with exercise prescribing."
