        "Obesity is associated with a decline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), while weight loss and exercise training have a positive influence. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of energy restriction (ER) alone intervention to diet and exercise intervention on HRQOL.",
        "MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched for randomised controlled trials examining HRQOL through lifestyle interventions which examined ER and energy restriction plus exercise in obese adults.",
        "Nine hundred and fifty-two papers were assessed for inclusion in this review with nine being deemed suitable. This review indicates that four studies provide evidence to support the role of exercise in addition to ER to improve HRQOL in adults with obesity. The findings of this review are limited due to the limited number of studies as well as substantial heterogeneity in ER, exercise prescription variables and outcome measures utilised within studies.",
        "A definitive conclusion regarding the capacity of exercise to facilitate greater improvement in HRQOL than diet alone, or, to formulate an exercise prescription for obese adults to address HRQOL is not feasible based on the existing evidence. Future studies should utilise comparable HRQOL assessment tools along with ensuring full reporting of results."
