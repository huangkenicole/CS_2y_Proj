        "Medically directed at-home rehabilitation was compared with group rehabilitation which began 3 weeks after clinically uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 127 men, mean age 53 +/- 7 years. Between 3 and 26 weeks after AMI, adherence to individually prescribed exercise was equally high (at least 71%), the increase in functional capacity equally large (1.8 +/- 1.0 METs) and nonfatal reinfarction and dropout rates equally low (both 3% or less) in the 66 men randomized to home training and the 61 men randomized to group training. No training-related complications occurred in either group. The low rate of reinfarction and death (5% and 1%, respectively) in the study as a whole, which included 34 patients with no training and 37 control patients, reflected a stepwise process of clinical evaluation, exercise testing at 3 weeks and frequent telephone surveillance of patients who underwent exercise training. Medically directed at-home rehabilitation has the potential to increase the availability and to decrease the cost of rehabilitating low-risk survivors of AMI."
