        "This study compared affective responses to low volume high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) and high-intensity continuous exercise (HICE). Twelve untrained males ([Formula: see text] 48.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0ml\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>) completed MICE (30\u00a0min cycle at 85% of ventilatory threshold (VT)), HICE (cycle at 105% of VT matched with MICE for total work), and HIIE (10 x 6\u00a0s cycle sprints with 60\u00a0s recovery). Affective valence and perceived activation were measured before exercise, post warm-up, every 20% of exercise time, and 1, 5, 10, and 15\u00a0min post-exercise. Affective valence during exercise declined by 1.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.42, 1.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.99, and 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.38 units in HICE, HIIE, and MICE, respectively, but was not statistically influenced by trial (P\u00a0=\u00a00.35), time (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06), or interaction effect (P\u00a0=\u00a00.08). Affective valence during HICE and HIIE was consistently less positive than MICE. Affective valence post-exercise was not statistically influenced by trial (P\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and at 5\u00a0min post-exercise exceeded end-exercise values (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048). Circumplex profiles showed no negative affect in any trial. Affective responses to low volume HIIE are similar to HICE but remain positive and rebound rapidly, suggesting it may be a potential alternative exercise prescription."
