        "<b>Purpose and Methods</b>: To compare the effects of a set of 12-30 min, maximal effort, constant load cycle bouts (HICT) to 12 short work: shorter rest (10 s: 5 s) interval sessions (INT) of similar duration and effort, performed on alternate days over 4 weeks, on performance and V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>.</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>. INT sessions consisted of repeated cycles of 10 s work followed by 5 s of recovery for 30 min. Fourteen male athletes (83 kg \u00b1 6, 24year \u00b1 2) were randomly assigned to HICT (n = 7) or INT (n = 7) training. Pre- and post-power output (PO), V\u0307O<sub>2</sub> and V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub>, during 60s, 3 min, and ramp (RAMP) tests were collected <b>Results</b>: Between group comparisons showed increased mean PO, pre- to post-INT training (<i>p</i> = .026) over the last min of the 3-min test whereas PO post-HICT training declined. INT showed greater training effects on the 60 s test than HCIT (INT 506 \u00b1 45 to 535 \u00b1 55 W; <i>p</i> = .002, Cd = .57; HCIT 513 \u00b1 78 to 548 \u00b1 83 W; <i>p</i> = .02, Cd = 27). RAMP peak PO and V\u0307O<sub>2peak</sub> increased within both groups (INT 341 \u00b1 63 to 370 \u00b1 48 W, <i>p</i> = .002, Cd = 0.52; HICT 332 \u00b1 45 to 353 \u00b1 44 W, <i>p</i> = .006, Cd = .53; 3.73 \u00b1 0.68 to 4.06 \u00b1 0.63 L\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = .001, Cd = .50; 3.75 \u00b1 0.62 to 4.09 \u00b1 0.52 L\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = .002, Cd = .59). <b>Conclusion(s)</b>: These results show that utilizing this novel short work: shorter rest (10 s: 5 s) interval training paradigm will elicit better performances in moderate duration performances compared to continuous training of the same duration, effort, and frequency."
