        "Physical inactivity is a growing epidemic in industrialized nations, contributing to the increasing prevalence and worsening of many chronic disease processes such as diabetes mellitus, cerebral vascular disease, and depression. It is well recognized that certain subpopulations are less likely to partake in physical activity than the population at large. Many minority populations, especially those of lower socioeconomic status, and women and children within these groups, are the most likely to be inactive. Promotion of increased physical activity within these subpopulations has been fraught with many obstacles. Interventions need to be developed with these groups in mind, addressing the beliefs and barriers specific to each group. This article reviews the available research on physical activity within minority populations, the barriers that exist, and offers recommendations on methods to increase adoption and maintenance of physical activity within minority groups."
