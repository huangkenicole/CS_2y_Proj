        "Due to the increase in the number of cancer patients, because of environmental parameters, high stress, low immunity, etc., there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective sensors for early targeted detection of cancerous cells with adequate selectivity and efficiency. Early disease diagnosis is important, as it is necessary to start treatments before disease progression. On the other hand, we need new, more efficient cancer treatment approaches with minimized side effects, more biocompatibility, and easy disposal. Nanobiotechnology is a field that can assist in developing new diagnostic and treatment approaches, specifically in fatal cancers. Herein, a study on the different applications of nanofibers in cancer detection as well as its treatment has been done. Here, a very brief survey on the main structure of biosensors and their different categories has been conducted and will precede the discussion of the study to serve as a reference and guide the reader's understanding."
