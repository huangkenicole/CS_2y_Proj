        "Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) is a transcription factor that has recently been identified as a crucial regulator of embryonic development and tumorigenesis. SIX1 is upregulated in different types of tumors, including breast cancer. However, the role and mechanism of SIX1 upregulation in breast cancer carcinogenesis remains uncertain.",
        "In this study, we utilized various databases such as UALCAN, TCGA, STRING, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter to investigate the mRNA expression, prognosis, transcriptional profile changes, signal pathway rewiring, and interaction with cancer stem cells of SIX1 in breast cancer. We also conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to validate its positive regulation effect on breast cancer stem cells.",
        "Our findings demonstrated that the expression of SIX1 varies among different subtypes of breast cancer and that it upregulates breast cancer grading and lymph node metastasis. Besides, SIX1 participates in the rewiring of several cancer signaling pathways, including estrogen, WNT, MAPK, and other pathways, and interacts with cancer stem cells. SIX1 showed a significant positive correlation with breast cancer stem cell markers such as ALDH1A1, EPCAM, ITGB1, and SOX2. Moreover, our in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that SIX1 can promote the increase in the proportion of stem cells and tumor progression.",
        "Altogether, our results suggest that SIX1 plays an essential regulatory role in breast cancer's occurrence, and its amplification can be utilized as a diagnostic and prognostic predictor. The interaction between SIX1 and cancer stem cells may play a critical role in regulating breast cancer's initiation and metastasis."
