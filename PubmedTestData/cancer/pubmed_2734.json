        "Adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most commonly diagnosed subtypes of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Numerous lung cancer cell types have exhibited electrotaxis under direct current electric fields (dcEF). Physiological electric fields (EF) play key roles in cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated electrotaxis of NSCLC cells, including human large cell lung carcinoma NCI-H460 and human lung squamous cell carcinoma NCI-H520 cells. Non-cancerous MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were included as a control. After dcEF stimulation, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells, which both exhibit epithelial-like morphology, migrated towards the cathode, while MRC-5 cells, which have fibroblast-like morphology, migrated towards the anode. The effect of doxycycline, a common antibiotic, on electrotaxis of MRC-5, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells was examined. Doxycycline enhanced the tested cells' motility but inhibited electrotaxis in the NSCLC cells without inhibiting non-cancerous MRC-5 cells. Based on our finding, further in-vivo studies could be devised to investigate the metastasis inhibition effect of doxycycline in an organism level."
