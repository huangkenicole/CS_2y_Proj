        "Resected specimens of benign and malignant gastric ulcers from 3441 cases were studied and compared clinically and pathologically. Among them, 421 cases of malignant ulcer were found. The malignant ulcers differed notably from the ulcerating gastric carcinoma and showed many similarities to the benign chronic gastric ulcer (CGU). The most distinct feature of malignant ulcer was the lack of cancerous infiltration and muscular residue in the scar tissue of ulcer base. The existence of this type of ulcer clinically and pathomorphologically supports the viewpoint that CGU can undergo malignant change. The rate of malignant change of CGU in this study was 3.48%."
