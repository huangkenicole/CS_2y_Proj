        "Cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality globally. This study estimates premature deaths at ages 30-69 years and distinguishes these as deaths that are preventable (avertable through primary or secondary prevention) or treatable (avertable through curative treatment) in 185 countries worldwide.",
        "For this population-based study, estimated cancer deaths by country, cancer, sex, and age groups were retrieved from the International Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2020 database. Crude and age-adjusted cancer-specific years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated for 36 cancer types.",
        "Of the estimated all-ages cancer burden of 265\u00b76 million YLLs, 182\u00b78 million (68\u00b78%) YLLs were due to premature deaths from cancer globally in 2020, with 124\u00b73 million (68\u00b70%) preventable and 58\u00b75 million (32\u00b70%) treatable. Countries with low, medium, or high human development index (HDI) levels all had greater proportions of YLLs at premature ages than very high HDI countries (68\u00b79%, 77\u00b70%, and 72\u00b72% vs 57\u00b77%, respectively). Lung cancer was the leading contributor to preventable premature YLLs in medium to very high HDI countries (17\u00b74% of all cancers, or 29\u00b77 million of 171\u00b73 million YLLs), whereas cervical cancer led in low HDI countries (26\u00b73% of all preventable cancers, or 1\u00b783 million of 6\u00b793 million YLLs). Colorectal and breast cancers were major treatable cancers across all four tiers of HDI (25\u00b75% of all treatable cancers in combination, or 14\u00b79 million of 58\u00b75 million YLLs).",
        "Alongside tailored programmes of early diagnosis and screening linked to timely and comprehensive treatment, greater investments in risk factor reduction and vaccination are needed to address premature cancer inequalities.",
