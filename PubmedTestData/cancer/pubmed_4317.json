        "The long intergenic non-coding RNA SNHG7 has been reported to be abnormally expressed in many types of cancer, the results remain controversial. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the clinicopathologic and prognostic value of SNHG7 in cancers. Electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase were used to search relevant studies. A combined hazard ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the association between SNHG7 expression and prognosis in cancer patients. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated to elaborate the association between SNHG7 expression and clinicopathological features in cancers. Besides, the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to validate the results. In total, eighteen studies compromising 1303 participants were enrolled in this analysis. The pooled results showed increased SNHG7 expression could predict unfavorable overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.75, 95%CI = 1.52-2.02, P = 0.000). Analysis stratified by follow-up time, cancer types, analysis types, sample sizes and cut off further verified the prognostic value of SNHG7. Additionally, elevated SNHG7 expression was correlated with TNM stage (OR: 3.31, 95%CI = 2.29-4.80, P = 0.000), lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.32, 95%CI = 1.61-6.83, P = 0.004), and tumor differentiation (OR = 1.92, 95%CI = 1.22-3.03, P =0.005) in patients with cancers. Excavation of TCGA dataset valuated that SNHG7 was upregulated in some cancers and predicted worse OS, which partially confirmed our results in this meta-analysis."
