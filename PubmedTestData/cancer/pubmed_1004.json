        "Many studies demonstrated that the expression level of HOTTIP in cancerous tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Increased expression of HOTTIP was associated with metastasis and a poor prognosis.",
        "The current meta-analysis collected all relevant articles and explored the association of HOTTIP expression levels with lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM), and overall survival (OS) in multiple cancers. Literature collections were conducted by searching a number of electronic databases (up to December 31, 2015). The Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan5.3 software and Stata SE12.0.",
        "A total of 602 patients with cancer from seven studies were included. The Meta-analysis results showed that lymph node metastasis occurred more frequently in patients with high HOTTIP expression than in patients with low HOTTIP expression (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.47 - 3.37, p = 0.0002, fixed-effects model), and a similar result was observed between HOTTIP expression and distant metastasis (OR = 3.30 (95% CI: 1.78 - 6.12, p = 0.0001, fixed-effects model). Moreover, we found that cancer patients with high HOTTIP expression had a poorer overall survival than those with low HOTTIP expression (HR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.64 - 2.83, p = 0.000, fixed-effects model).",
