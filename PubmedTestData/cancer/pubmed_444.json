        "In order to analyze multiple statistic tables more efficiently Excel Visual Basic for Application (VBA) was introduced through the use of an example of calculating standardized mortality rates (SMRs).",
        "Mortality data of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, by sex and age, have been collected from 1991 to 2003 by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Shanghai Huangpu District. Standard population composition was defined as Chinese census statistics in 2000. The male's SMRs were calculated, using Excel VBA for each year and classification of cancers.",
        "The male's SMRs were obtained by year and different cancers. At the same time, the results were listed in the cancer's SMRs table for male.",
        "Excel is more flexible than general database on the combination of data and annotation. Excel VBA is better than the basic Excel in operating multiple tables simultaneously and man-machine conversation. Statistic analysis can be efficiently completed by using Excel VBA."
