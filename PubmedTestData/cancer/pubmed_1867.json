        "Recent developments in mass spectrometry have introduced clinical proteomics to the forefront of diseases diagnosis, offering reliable, robust and efficient analytical method for biomarker discovery and monitoring. MALDI-TOF is a powerful tool for surveying proteins and peptides comprising the realm for clinical analysis. MALDI-TOF has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnostics by facilitating biomarker discovery, enabling tissue imaging and quantifying biomarker levels. Healthy (control) and cancerous tissues can be analyzed on the basis of mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) imaging to identify cancer-specific changes that may prove to be clinically useful. We review MALDI-TOF profiling techniques as tools for detection of cancer biomarkers in various cancers. We mainly discuss recent advances including period from 2011 to 2013."
