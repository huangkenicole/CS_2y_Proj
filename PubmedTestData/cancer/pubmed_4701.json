        "One hundred and seventy cancerous lesions observed among 159 esophagectomised specimens were systematically investigated with histochemical staining methods in addition to the ordinary hematoxylin-eosin staining. About 2/3 of them, 113 lesions, were entirely consisted of the squamous elements, regardless with pearl-formation or not, Group 1. On the contrary, the remaining 57 lesions (33.5%) showed foci of esophageal gland-like transformation, Group 2. Those lesions were specified by constituent epithelia with esophageal glandular epithelia-like characteristics; positive for epithelial mucin, secretory component and S-100 protein. Such esophageal gland-like structures could be demonstrated exclusively in cancerous foci penetrated through the lamina muscularis mucosa. Those 113 lesions of the Group 1 did not show any such transformation even by the meticulous examination of the whole lesion by the step sectioning. Those lesions of the Group 2 had a distinct tendency of the perpendicular mural penetration and submucosal extension than the horizontal mucosal involvement, giving rise a characteristic appearance resembling to submucosal tumors. On the contrary, those of the Group 1 showed an ordinary mural extension pattern corresponding to the extent of mucosal involvement, so-to-speak, a typical features of common esophageal cancer. No outstanding difference in biological behaviours could be obviated between two groups so far examined; survival rate, lymph node metastasis, vascular permeation, intraepithelial extension, etc."
