        "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are self-renewing and slow-multiplying micro subpopulations in tumour microenvironments. CSCs contribute to cancer's resistance to radiation (including radiation) and other treatments. CSCs control the heterogeneity of the tumour. It alters the tumour's microenvironment cellular singling and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Current research decodes the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and CSCs interlink in radiation resistance. Exosome is a subpopulation of EVs and originated from plasma membrane. It is secreted by several active cells. It involed in cellular communication and messenger of healthly and multiple pathological complications. Exosomal biological active cargos (DNA, RNA, protein, lipid and glycan), are capable to transform recipient cells' nature. The molecular signatures of CSCs and CSC-derived exosomes are potential source of cancer theranostics development. This review discusse cancer stem cells, radiation-mediated CSCs development, EMT associated with CSCs, the role of exosomes in radioresistance development, the current state of radiation therapy and the use of CSCs and CSCs-derived exosomes biomolecules as a clinical screening biomarker for cancer. This review gives new researchers a reason to keep an eye on the next phase of scientific research into cancer theranostics that will help mankind."
