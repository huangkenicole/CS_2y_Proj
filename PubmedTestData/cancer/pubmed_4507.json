        "Trigger transposable element-derived 1 (TIGD1), a human species-specific gene, was identified as a cell cycle-related differentially expressed gene during the formation of liver cancer. As far as we know, there are no reports about the function of TIGD1. This study aimed to explore the expression of TIGD1 in human cancers and establish whether elevated TIGD1 can be used as a prognostic cancer biomarker and its potential role in cancer.",
        "Molecular profiling of TIGD1 in human cancers was assessed using a series of databases, including Oncomine, COSMIC, Kaplan-Meier, UCSC, and cBioPortal.",
        "We found that TIGD1 overexpressed in colorectal, gastric, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers than their normal tissues and its expression might be negatively related with the prognosis. The TIGD1 coexpression genes were obtained from cBioPortal and analyzed using ClueGO plugin in Cytoscape to predict the function of TIGD1.",
        "In summary, the elevated TIGD1 expression is coupled with a malignant survival rate in several cancers. It may play its role by regulating cell-cycle progression. These findings provide fresh insight into our understanding of TEs in cancers. As a previously unreported gene, future research is required to validate our findings and illuminate the molecular mechanisms. In conclusion, we systemically analyze the expression, prognostic value, and likely role of TIGD1, the unknown function gene, in cancer. Our finding provides evidence that TIGD1 involve in the cell cycle. These findings provide fresh insight into our understanding of TEs in cancers. Next, the detailed mechanism of TIGD1 needs to be studied in the future."
