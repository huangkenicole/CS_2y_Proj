        "Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experience a two- to four-fold increased risk of developing and dying from cancer compared with the general population. High cancer risk results from the interaction of both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This mapping review explores the impact of sex disparity on cancer's increased incidence and mortality after kidney transplantation (KT). In terms of age, population-based studies indicate that younger recipients of both sexes experience a higher risk of cancer, but this is more pronounced in young women. On the contrary, older men are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, although their increased risk is not statistically significant compared with the general population. Regarding cancer type, studies show an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma, gynecologic and lung cancer in women, and bladder and kidney cancer in men. Immune-related cancers such as pos-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and melanoma are increased in both sexes. Mortality also shows differences between sexes. Although cancer is the second cause of death in both male and female KTRs, studies show higher overall mortality in men and elderly recipients. However, the relative risk of cancer mortality compared with the general population is higher at a younger age, with disparate results regarding sex. Female KTRs appear to die at a younger age than males when compared with the general population. Differences in cancer rates by sex after renal transplantation need further studies. A better understanding of sex-specific differences in cancer epidemiology after KT could help nephrologists to better address pre-transplant counseling, to establish early surveillance programs, and to plan modifiable risk factors such as immunosuppression."
