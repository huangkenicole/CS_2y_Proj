      "AbstractText": [
        "Field cancerization with actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (AK/SCCIS) represents a common therapeutic challenge in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). These patients often show inadequate responses to methods traditionally used as monotherapy (e.g., topical chemotherapy).",
        "To describe the clinical outcomes and feasibility of a sequential approach to treatment of field cancerization in SOTRs.",
        "Four SOTRs with field cancerization of the scalp and/or face were treated using a sequential approach. Light curettage of hypertrophic lesions was followed by application of 5-fluorouracil 5% cream twice daily for 5 days and photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 1-hour incubation on day 6. Pain level during and after PDT was recorded. Photographs were obtained immediately before and after treatment and at follow-up appointments.",
        "All 4 patients tolerated this approach well and demonstrated excellent responses to treatment with complete or near-complete clinical resolution of AK/SCCIS lesions. Patients remained free of AK/SCCIS based on clinical examination 1 to 6 months after treatment.",
        "For SOTRs with field cancerization, sequential therapy represents a viable therapeutic regimen with good tolerability and durable clinical response. This approach warrants further investigation to determine which therapeutic combinations have optimal tolerability and efficacy."
