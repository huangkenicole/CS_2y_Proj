        "The purpose was to describe whether there are field cancerization (FC) indicators in clinically normal mucosa opposite to primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).",
        "A search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Livivo databases was performed on June 12, 2022, which retrieved 152 records without duplicates. Studies that analyzed FC in biopsies in clinically normal tissue opposite to primary OSCC were included. The search was conducted under the PRISMA guideline and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017077125).",
        "Eight articles with 302 patients were included, 192 men and 110 women, mean age 57.1 years. Most patients had deleterious habits. All studies performed histopathological confirmation of OSCC and biopsies were obtained the clinically normal mirror mucosa. The meta-analysis carried out with eight studies. The studies showed 57.3\u00a0% of cases with histopathological changes of clinically normal mucosa opposite to primary OSCC (Confidence interval 95\u00a0%, 0.443-0.703; heterogeneity: Q value 18.715; I<sup>2</sup> 73.284\u00a0%; n\u00a0=\u00a0205). p53 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis may be predictive for detecting changes. There was p53 immunoexpression in 41.3\u00a0% of cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.872) (n\u00a0=\u00a055), ki-67 immunoexpression (<\u00a020\u00a0%) in 68\u00a0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) (n\u00a0=\u00a097) and ki-67 immunoexpression (>\u00a020\u00a0%) in 28.4\u00a0% of cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) (n\u00a0=\u00a0110).",
        "The findings suggest that FC can occur, and there are histopathological changes in clinically normal tissue opposite to primary OSCC. Nevertheless, the review showed that more longitudinal studies on FC are needed to draw a conclusive indication of the occurrence of FC in oral tissues opposite to OSCC."
