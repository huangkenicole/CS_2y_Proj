        "Endometrial cancer is the most common female cancer showing continuous rise in its incidence and mortality rate. Despite the extensive research efforts in cancer therapeutics, still there is a lack of effective treatment options and the outcome is poor for patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of niclosamide (NIC) against endometrial cancer. NIC is an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, which has been recently extensively studied as a potent anti-cancerous agent in several cancers. The anti-cancerous activity of NIC was analyzed in-vitro (ANC3A, Hec1B, and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines) by cell viability-, soft agar-, invasion- and migration- assay. The action mechanism of NIC was demonstrated by western blot analysis and immune-fluorescence imaging and validated by specific inhibitors. The in-vivo efficacy of NIC was studied in the Ishikawa xenograft animal model. NIC effectively suppressed the viability (IC<sub>50<</sub>1\u00a0\u03bcM), colony formation ability, migration, and invasion of all endometrial cancer cells tested. We demonstrated that NIC inhibited AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and induced apoptosis and autophagy in endometrial cancer cells. Further study demonstrated that although NIC induced autophagosome formation, it inhibits autolysosome formation. In addition, we observed that NIC induced BAX co-localization with lysosome and inhibited Cathepsin B maturation from pro-cathepsin B, thereby inducing the lysosomal membrane permeability and release of hydrolytic enzymes from the lysosome to cytosol, which eventually contributed cell death. NIC also inhibited tumor weight and volume in the Ishikawa xenograft animal model without having any evidence of toxicity. Due to its potent anti-cancerous activity and safety profile, NIC seems to be a promising agent for human endometrial cancer therapeutics."
