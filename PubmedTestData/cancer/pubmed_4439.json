        "Ten cases of double cancers (a lung cancer and a stomach cancer) were evaluated in relation to previous asbestos exposure. Ten cases involved male more than 69 years old. Five cases had developed their two cancers simultaneously and other 5 cases had developed their lung cancer after stomach cancer surgery. The lung cancer was their main disease. Four cases had early stage stomach cancers and 5 cases with a stomach cancer had no relapse after surgery. Eight cases had occupational histories of asbestos exposure. Significantly high numbers of asbestos bodies were detected in the autopsied lung in almost all cases. According to the X-ray analysis, almost all asbestos fibers detected in the lung were chrysotile. Additionally, the Brinkman Index (B.I.) of these 10 cases ranged between 700 and 2,000. The combination of asbestos exposure and smoking is thought to be an important factor in the development of such double cancers."
