        "Esophageal squamous neoplasm presents a spectrum of different diatheses. A precise assessment for individualized treatment depends on the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. Detection relies on comprehensive and accurate white-light, iodine staining, and narrow-band imaging endoscopy. These methods have limitations in addition to its invasive nature and the potential risks related to the method. These limitations include difficulties in precise tumor delineation to enable complete resection, inflammation and malignancy differentiation, and stage determination. The resolution of these problems depends on the surgeon's ability and experience with available technology for visualization and resection. We proposed a method for identifying early esophageal cancerous lesion by endoscopy and hyperspectral endoscopic imaging. Experimental result shows the characteristic spectrum of a normal esophagus, precancerous lesion, canceration, and intraepithelial papillary capillary loop can be identified through principal component score chart. The narrow-band imaging (NBI) image shows remarkable spectral characteristic distribution, and the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method are higher than those of other methods by ~0.8 and ~0.88, respectively. The proposed method enables the accurate visualization of target organs, it may be useful to capsule endoscope and telemedicine, which requires highly precise images for diagnosis."
