        "Obesity is well-known as the second factor for tumorigenesis after smoking and is bound up with the malignant progression of several kinds of cancers, including esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, and ovarian cancer. The increased morbidity and mortality of obesity-related cancer are mostly attributed to dysfunctional adipose tissue. The possible mechanisms connecting dysfunctional adipose tissue to high cancer risk mainly focus on chronic inflammation, obesity-related microenvironment, adipokine secretion disorder, and browning of adipose tissue, and so forth. The stromal vascular cells in adipose tissue trigger chronic inflammation through secreting inflammatory factors and promote cancer cell proliferation. Hypertrophic adipose tissues lead to metabolic disorders of adipocytes, such as abnormal levels of adipokines that mediate cancer progression and metastasis. Cancer patients often show adipose tissue browning and cancerous cachexia in an advanced stage, which lead to unsatisfied chemotherapy effect and poor prognosis. However, increasing evidence has shown that adipose tissue may display quite opposite effects in cancer development. Therefore, the interaction between cancers and adipose tissue exert a vital role in mediates adipose tissue dysfunction and further leads to cancer progression. In conclusion, targeting the dysfunction of adipose tissue provides a promising strategy for cancer prevention and therapy."
