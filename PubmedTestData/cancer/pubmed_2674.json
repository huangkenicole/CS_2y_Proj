        "TP53 mutation is a driver mutation of oral carcinogenesis. This study investigated cancerous and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to detect the target hotspot somatic mutation of TP53.",
        "TP53 target hotspot mutations were determined in surgically resected primary tumor samples from 107 OSCC patients.",
        "Cancerous and cfDNA samples were examined for mutations through droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) by using mutation-specific assays. The ddPCR results were evaluated alongside clinicopathological data.",
        "In total, 23 cases had target TP53 mutations in varying degrees. We found that OSCC had relatively low cfDNA shedding, and mutations were at low allele frequencies. Of these 23 cases, 13 had target TP53 mutations in their corresponding cfDNA. Target somatic mutations in cancerous DNA and cfDNA are related to cervical lymph node metastasis. The cfDNA concentration is related to primary tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and OSCC stage.",
        "Our results show that the detection of TP53 target somatic mutations in OSCC patients by using ddPCR is technically feasible. Low levels of cfDNA may produce different results between cancerous tissue and cfDNA analyses. Future research on cfDNA may quantify diagnostic biomarkers in the surveillance of OSCC patients."
