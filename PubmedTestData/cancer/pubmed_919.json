      "AbstractText": [
        "Although magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) can help identify the horizontal margin (HM) of early gastric cancer (EGC), little is known about the factors that can clarify the HM by using ME-NBI. We aimed to characterize the pathological features of lesions in which the HM was identified using ME-NBI.",
        "The HMs of 639 differentiated-type EGCs treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection or surgery were analyzed using conventional endoscopy and ME-NBI. The number and width of the intervening parts (IP) and the number, width, and depth of the subepithelial capillaries (SEC) in cancerous and noncancerous areas were measured.",
        "In 13 lesions (2.0%), more than 90% of the HM was not recognized with conventional endoscopy, but 11 of these lesions were detectable with ME-NBI (NBI group). The HMs of the other 626 lesions were mostly recognized using conventional endoscopy (WLI/CE group). In the NBI group, the IP width, standard deviation (SD), and number of IPs did not significantly differ between the cancerous and noncancerous areas. However, the SEC number was significantly larger and the depth was shallower in cancerous areas. In the WLI/CE group, the IP width and SD were significantly larger, but the IP number was significantly smaller in cancerous areas. The SEC depth was significantly shallower in cancerous areas.",
        "Differences of IP width, SD, and IP number may be factors for identifying HMs with conventional endoscopy. Because NBI can better visualize vessel structures, the increased SEC number and shallow SECs may clarify the HM."
