      "AbstractText": [
        "A 30-MHz ultrasonic scanner was used to collect B-scan images together with appropriate radiofrequency echoes from diseased and healthy skin regions of patients with diagnosed basal cell carcinoma and pre-cancerous lesions (actinic keratosis). Radiofrequency data were processed to obtain the attenuation coefficient and statistics of the backscattered echo signal determination (K-distribution and effective density of scatterers [EDS]). The attenuation coefficient was significantly higher for patients with basal cell carcinoma than for healthy patients. Also, the pre-cancerous skin lesions had increased attenuation. The averaged EDS values for cancer lesions were significantly lower than those for pre-cancerous lesions and healthy skin. The successful differentiation between the tissue groups examined suggests the potential value of the attenuation coefficient and EDS for carcinoma characterization."
