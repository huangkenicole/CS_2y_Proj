        "Increasing evidence indicates that the ability of cancer cells to convey biological information to recipient cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for tumor progression. Microvesicles (MVs) are heterogenous vesicles formed by budding of the cellular membrane, which are secreted in larger amounts by cancer cells than normal cells. Recently, several reports have also disclosed that MVs function as important mediators of intercellular communication between cancerous and stromal cells within the TME, orchestrating complex pathophysiological processes. Chemokines are a family of small inflammatory cytokines that are able to induce chemotaxis in responsive cells. MVs which selective incorporate chemokines as their molecular cargos may play important regulatory roles in oncogenic processes including tumor proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, chemoresistance and immunomodulation, et al. Therefore, it is important to explore the association of MVs and chemokines in TME, identify the potential prognostic marker of tumor, and develop more effective treatment strategies. Here we review the relevant literature regarding the role of MVs and chemokines in TME."
