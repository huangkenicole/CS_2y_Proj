        "The KRAS status in cancer tissue with submucosal or deeper invasion was investigated in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Fifteen cancerous lesions in 10 FAP patients were subjected to analysis for KRAS status. The clinical features of FAP were the dense type in 2 patients and the sparse type in 8 patients. Of the 15 cancerous lesions, 6 (40%) were identified as having wild-type KRAS and the remaining 9 (60%), as having mutated KRAS. Of the 9 mutated lesions, the G13D mutation was recognized in 4 patients and was the most frequent pattern. With regard to the KRAS status in patients with multiple cancerous lesions, 1 patient had 3 cancerous lesions of which 2 were of the mutated type and 1 was of the wild type and another patient had 4 cancerous lesions of which 3 were of the mutated type and 1 was of the wild type. These results suggest that the frequency of wild-type KRAS in cancer associated with FAP was approximately 40%, although it was lower than that in sporadic cancer. Moreover, we need to analyze the KRAS status in all cancerous lesions in clinical practice when chemotherapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody is required for the treatment of FAP patients with unresectable advanced multiple cancers."
