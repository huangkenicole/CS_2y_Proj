        "To analyse the frequency, characteristics and diagnosis of synchronic neoplastic lesions in colorectal cancer.",
        "A review was carried out of 384 colorectal cancers, diagnosed through complete colonoscopy and resected. The synchronic cancers and the characteristics of the adenomas were determined: number, size, histological type, dysplasia, as well as their localisation in the colon and with respect to the carcinoma.",
        "Twenty-eight synchronic cancers were found (7.3% of the total); 8 developed tumours and 20 malignant polyps. In 54.4% of the cases there was a synchronic adenoma. In patients with synchronic lesions, 43% showed an advanced adenoma. Twenty percent of the synchronic polyps found were proximal to the splenic flexure; 41% were distal and 38% had both localisations. Fifty-nine point one percent of the patients had some adenoma proximal to the cancer, with criteria of advanced adenoma in 13.9%. The distribution of the adenomas was more uniformly spread in the cancers with a proximal localisation (p = 0.038). Seventeen percent of the distal cancers presented synchronic lesions with a proximal colon localisation exclusively. Partial endoscopies would diagnose the distal cancers, but would omit a synchronic adenoma in 42.3% of the sigmoidoscopies and 40% of the short colonoscopies.",
        "High rates of carcinoma and synchronic adenomas were registered. We underline the high index of advanced adenomas and the frequency of synchronic lesions proximal to the cancer, which is why incomplete colonoscopies, although allowing the diagnosis of the distal cancer, omit a high percentage of synchronic adenomas, including advanced lesions. All of this confirms the need to perform a complete pre-, intra- and post operational colonoscopy in resectable colorectal cancer."
