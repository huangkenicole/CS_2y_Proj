        "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a malignant tumor that affects the cells of the gallbladder. Management of this condition is challenging and continuously evolving. Surgery, radiotherapy\u00a0and chemotherapy are the current standards of care. However, recently, immunotherapy, a treatment that stimulates the host's\u00a0immune system to target cancerous cells, has proven to be effective as a line of treatment. Promising results are continuously published. This article reviews the major advances in immunotherapy regarding the management of GBC."

        "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively infrequent but highly lethal cancer with a poor prognosis. Management remains challenging and controversial, and most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. However, with the progressive advances in the use of immunotherapies, new treatment modalities are being implemented. In September 2022, the US\u00a0FDA approved durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in combination with chemotherapy for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic GBC. This groundbreaking news is the first FDA approval for the use of immunotherapy in biliary tract cancers. This article reviews the newest advances and trials regarding immunotherapy for GBC."
