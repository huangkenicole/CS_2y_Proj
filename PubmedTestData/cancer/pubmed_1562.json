        "Cancers induced by ionizing radiation have no particular specificity nor genetic remarkable signature, excepting numerous multideletions. They should therefore be studied in the general field of cancer biology in its broad sense. A gap remains between the initial events like the rather well identified genomic damage and the subsequent emerging cellular clone with cancer characteristics. Intermediate steps are generally described as accumulation of mutations and epigenetic modifications leading at one point to the malignant phenotype. However we have no clear nor understandable model on these steps of malignant transformation till now. It is quite possible that specific causes (tobacco, alcohol, radiations, chemical toxics) which produce different initial abnormalities then lead to (or accelerate the entry in) the common and same way as that resulting of accumulations of damage due to ageing. Genomic instability is certainly an important factor involved in the cellular drift leading to malignant transformation. We postulate that only cells having both a high telomerase activity and a low apoptotic activity may become cancerous. The hypothesis is that cancer results from a genome reprogramming of these cells due to an oncogenic mitotic pressure which induces a loss of the differentiation control. We propose to name anti-apoptosis, in contrast to apoptosis which is the programmed death, the ultimate process by which a cell loses its tissue-related properties. The oncogenic activation may propagate to primordial genes of development resulting in emergence of a subnuclear with tumoral activity. Bio-molecular studies of embryonic development and of genome re-programming will probably allow us to better understand the mechanisms of cancer."
