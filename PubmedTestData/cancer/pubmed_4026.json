        "Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2) is mitogenic to numerous epithelial, mesodermal and endothelial cells, and thus may play a role in the neovascularity and progression of several tumors. Furthermore, FGF-2 is reported to be elevated in the serum and urine of patients with various cancers, including renal cancer. Obesity, with increased body fat, is a risk factor for renal cancer through unknown mechanisms. Since adipose tissue is a source of FGF-2, we determined the quantity and quality of activity of FGF-2 in omental adipose tissue and compared it to normal and cancerous renal tissue.",
        "Using heparin-Sepharose chromatography we extracted proteins from human omental adipose tissue, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign renal tissue (BRT). Using FGF-2 antisera we performed western blot analysis to confirm their homology to FGF-2. We also assessed recovery, mitogenicity and angiogenicity of each of the proteins using thymidine incorporation into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay.",
        "Each of the three purified mitogenic proteins eluted with NaCl concentrations between 1.4 M. and 1.8 M., similar to control FGF-2. There was greater recovery of FGF-2 from omental adipose tissue compared with renal cell carcinoma or benign renal tissue (42 microg. vs. 24 microg. and 18 microg., respectively; ANOVA p <0.05). Moreover, FGF-2 from adipose tissue had greater mitogenic activity (96.% versus 68% and 38%; p <0.05) and greater angiogenic activity (5.5 vessels versus 2.7 and 1.6 vessels; p <0.05) on the CAM assay.",
        "We suggest that human omental adipose tissue FGF-2 may demonstrate greater mitogenic and angiogenic activity than either benign or cancerous renal tissue FGF-2. It is not known if FGF-2 from adipose tissue may play a role in the relationship between obesity and renal cancer."
