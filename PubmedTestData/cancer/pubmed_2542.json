      "AbstractText": [
        "Neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK, a large structural scaffold protein, remains mysterious in biological processes. AHNAK plays a suppressive or progressive role in different types of cancers. To investigate the role of the AHNAK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cell viability assays were performed to determine the cell proliferation of the stable AHNAK-knockdown HepG2 cell line; co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were performed on HCC and matched paracancerous (MPC) tissues. The Metascape platform was used for enrichment analyses; the \"ComplexHeatmap\" package was applied for cluster analyses and visualization. Co-IP, Western botting and immunofluorescence double staining were performed to assess the interactions between AHNAK and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). AHNAK silencing reduced the viability of HepG2 cells; the interactome in HCC and MPC tissues enriched 204 pathways and processes, which partially reflected the signature of HCC field cancerization. AHNAK could co-localize and interact with IGF-1R. These results suggested that the AHNAK complex contributes to HCC growth, potentially by interacting with IGF-1R."
