        "1) The present paper concerns the relationship between localization and extension of gastric cancers and the spectral characteristics of the EGG in 73 subjects (32 women and 41 men). 2) The recordings were made in the morning (during 1 h) on fastened patients. Three sets of bipolar cutaneous electrodes were placed on the abdomen around the pyloric radiological projection taken for axis (radius 7 cm; angle 60 degrees); sampling period for analysis is 1 per sec. The spectrum is computed (FFT) for 256 samples in each channel. 3) In the control subjects (n = 72: 24 women and 48 men), the \"normal characteristics\" of the peak EGG are the following: frequency: 2.89 +/- 0.2 c/min; amplitude 40 +/- 20 microV (2-5 derivation), whatever the age. 4) In the cancerous subjects significative increase of the mean spectral component amplitude of the gastric frequency was always found in all different localizations. However, this criterion of amplitude was missing for the corpus localization. 5) The process of infiltration of the wall was accompanied by a significative decrease of the mean frequency. But in ulcerous, vegetant or stenosant cases the frequency was not affected in contrast with the amplitude. 6) In extensive cases the decrease of the frequency was more important. If in several cases (early cancers, mucous cancers of the lesser or greater curvature), no significative abnormality of the spectrum was observed, abnormalities are frequent in cardiac, fundic and antral neoplasies."
