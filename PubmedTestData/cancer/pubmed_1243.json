        "Golgi phosphoprotein 2 (GOLPH2) has been associated with the development and progression of various human cancers. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between GOLPH2 and gastric cancer (GC) progression and explore the clinical significance of GOLPH2 in GC. GOLPH2 expression was examined in four\u00a0pairs of primary GC tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues from the same patients, using immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, GOLPH2 protein expression was analyzed in 10\u00a0normal gastric tissues and 385\u00a0clinicopathologically characterized cases of GC by IHC. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the prognostic and diagnostic associations. GOLPH2 mRNA and protein expression were both markedly upregulated in GC tissues, compared with the paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The Chi-square test and Spearman analysis revealed a significant correlation between GOLPH2 expression and clinical stage, T\u00a0classification, lymph node metastasis, metastasis and venous invasion. Patients with a higher GOLPH2 expression had a shorter overall survival (OS), compared to patients with lower GOLPH2 expression. Notably, our results suggested that GOLPH2 is associated with the development and progression of GC. Therefore, additional studies focusing on the potential of GOLPH2 as a novel therapeutic target in GC are required."
