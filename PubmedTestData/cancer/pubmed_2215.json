        "We report 2 previously undescribed morphological variants of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). The first variant with an intestinal phenotype was associated with mucinous carcinomas that occurred in the tail of the pancreas of 2 men (60 and 65 years old). The carcinomas lacked the characteristic ovarian-like stroma of mucinous cystic neoplasms observed in female patients and did not show a papillary architecture. Whether they represent mucinous cystadenocarcinomas or mucinous carcinomas that arose from the flat variant of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms could not be determined with certainty. Microscopically, the intestinal type of PanIN was composed of pseudostratified columnar cells similar to those of colonic adenomas and showing variable degrees of dysplasia. A significant increase in the MIB-1 labeling index correlated with the severity of dysplasia. In contrast to conventional PanIN, the intestinal variant expressed MUC-2 and was MUC-1 negative. The second type of PanIN had an oncocytic phenotype, coexpressed MUC-2 and MUC-1 mucins, and was associated with intraductal oncocytic papillary carcinomas that showed a similar immunohistochemical mucin profile. Both intestinal and oncocytic types of PanIN expressed DPC4 and lacked p53 reactivity. The anatomical separation of the PanINs from the carcinomas and the gradual progression of cytological and architectural abnormalities in both variants of PanIN argue against ductal spread (cancerization of the ducts). The intestinal and oncocytic variants of PanIN broaden the morphological spectrum of this intraductal lesion. Although their significance is unknown, the possibility that these PanIN variants represent cancer precursors should be considered."
