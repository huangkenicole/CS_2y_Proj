        "With an increase in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) cases, unsuspected gallbladder cancers have been reported and intraabdominal cancer dissemination has been identified as a crucial problem. Since September 1991, we employed LC with full-thickness dissection (LC-F) for polypoid lesions of the gallbladder. In the present study, the utility of the procedure was investigated.",
        "For 261 patients who underwent standard LC (S-LC) or LC-F between September 1991 and August 1996, the operation time, intra- and post-operative complications relevant to the operative technique, histological findings of the gallbladders, and prognosis of each patient with gallbladder cancer were evaluated.",
        "S-LC and LC-F were performed in 231 and 30 patients, respectively. The mean operation times for S-LC and LC-F were 157 and 120 min, respectively, (p < 0.05). Gallbladder perforation occurred in 29 S-LCs, whereas there was none in 30 LC-Fs (p < 0.05). Bleeding from the gallbladder bed occurred in 1 patient in each of the 2 groups, but was stopped easily. There was neither post-operative bleeding nor bile leakage in either group. Mucosal cancer was diagnosed in 3 gallbladders resected by S-LC and 1 resected by LC-F. One patient of the LC-F group with advanced cancer underwent laparotomy. All the patients have no signs of recurrence.",
        "LC-F allows the complete removal of the connective tissue of the gallbladder bed without perforation and, therefore, is considered as a safe and useful procedure for resecting gallbladders with potentially cancerous lesions."
