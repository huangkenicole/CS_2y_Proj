        "Pathomorphology of 302 primary bronchogenic adenocarcinomas resected in our hospital from 1957 to 1984 was studied. It consisted of 23.5% of the total lung cancers. Gross findings are: central type 15.9%, peripheral type 82.4%, and disseminated type. 1.7%. Cancerous cavity was observed in 13.2%. According to the histologic classification of lung tumor, WHO, 1981, adenocarcinoma was divided into four subtypes: 1. acinar adenocarcinoma (132 cases); 2. papillary adenocarcinoma (73 cases); 3. bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (74 cases) and 4. solid carcinoma with mucus formation (23 cases). Among them, there were 16.6% of scar carcinoma and 1 case associated with asbestosis. 15 cases were studied by electron microscope. The 5-year survival rate was 19.6% (peripheral type 21.7%, central type 12.5% and disseminated type 0%). There was no significant difference in the prognoses of the histologic subtypes. The patients without metastasis to the hilum, mediastinum or positive stump had better prognosis. The relationship between adenocarcinoma and bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma is discussed."
