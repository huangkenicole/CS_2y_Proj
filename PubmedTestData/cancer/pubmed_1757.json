        "Human papillomavirus (HPV) belongs to the Papillomaviridae family and infects squamous cells and mucous membranes of humans. Various studies conducted over the last years have shown a correlation between HPV infection and carcinogenesis process. The DNA of the virus is detected in approximately 20% of cancers of the upper respiratory tract. The presence of HPV in cancerous lesion of the larynx varies depending on the procedure applied for sample collection and the viral DNA detection method. The high variance in the frequency of HPV detection is observed even among results obtained with the use of PCR reaction. It varies between 3 and 85%. HPV is also the etiological factor of laryngeal papillomas in both children and adults. However, a considerable amount of research demonstrates that 1-7% of the larynx papillomas in adults undergo transformation into squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of the study was to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the presence of the HPV virus in the larynx as well as its participation in malignant transformation."
