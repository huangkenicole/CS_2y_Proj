        "C-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1) not only is full but also a subunit (CSN5) of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (CSN), which is an evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional protein that involves in controlling cellular proliferation and apoptosis, affecting a series of pathways, as well as regulating genomic instability and DNA damage and repair. The CSN is a highly conservative protein from yeast to human and interacts with the cullin-RING family of ubiquitin ligases so that it could be execute a process of removing NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like polypeptide (deneddylase activity). The role of Jab1/CSN5's multi-function has been proved as being oncogenic in nature, what is more, Jab1/CSN5 has been confirmed by much evidence that it participates in the carcinogenesis progression and is tightly associated with poor prognosis. However, the biologic implication of Jab1/CSN5 activity during the cancer's development is unclear. We performed a systematic literature review and assessment from PubMed and Medline databases in this article. Jab1/CSN5 is participate in a lot of biologic responses, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA metabolism, invasion, DNA damage and repair, and recurrence. It also promotes cell transformation and tumorigenesis. In this review, we mainly expound the progress in the function and research advances of Jab1/CSN5 and in untangling the Jab1/CSN5 signaling pathway. Based on these bases, its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer can play a greater role in future cancer treatment."
