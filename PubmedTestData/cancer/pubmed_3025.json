        "The tumor microenvironment (TME) constitutes multiple cell types including cancerous and non-cancerous cells. The intercellular communication between these cells through TME derived exosomes may either enhance or suppress the tumorigenic processes. The tumor-derived exosomes could convert an anti-tumor environment into a pro-tumor environment by inducing the differentiation of stromal cells into tumor-associated cells. The exosomes from tumor-associated stromal cells reciprocally trigger epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells, which impose therapeutic resistance and metastasis. It is well known that these exosomes contain the signals of EMT, but how these signals execute chemoresistance and metastasis in tumors remains elusive. Understanding the significance and molecular signatures of exosomes transmitting EMT signals would aid in developing appropriate methods of inhibiting them. In this review, we focus on molecular signatures of exosomes that shuttle between cancer cells and their stromal populations in TME to explicate their impact on therapeutic resistance and metastasis through EMT. Especially Wnt signaling is found to be involved in multiple ways of exosomal transport and hence we decipher the biomolecules of Wnt signaling trafficked through exosomes and their potential in serving as therapeutic targets."
