        "Total tissue content and subcellular distribution of DHEA sulfate, DHEA, androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-diol, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, testosterone, 5 alpha-DHT, and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol as well as the activities of steroid sulfate-sulfatase, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 5 alpha-reductase, 3 alpha/beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase were quantified in 12 untreated primary tumors of prostatic cancer. Samples were obtained by radical prostatectomy and serial sections, and were alternately used for either biochemical or morphological evaluation. The results were compared with values determined in benign parts of the same prostates. Qualitatively, all enzymes and steroids found in the benign tissues could also be demonstrated in the cancers. Steroid patterns showed individual quantitative variation but no general differences between the carcinomas and the benign tissues. Enzymes showed a tendency to lower activities in the cancers, particularly when expressed per DNA. Substantial diminutions of creatine kinase and 5 alpha-reductase activity, the latter being often accompanied by an increased testosterone/DHT ratio, were the most striking differences seen in most of the cases between malignant and nonmalignant tissues. Some interesting individual parallels of morphological and biochemical aspects were seen, but there was no obvious general parallelism between the histological picture and endocrinological characteristics."
