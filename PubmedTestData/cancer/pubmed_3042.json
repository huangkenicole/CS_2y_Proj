        "Breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiotherapy is the standard of care for most patients with early breast cancers; however, the aesthetic outcomes of this procedure is not always desirable. Oncoplastic breast surgery is an innovative approach that aims at the safe and effective treatment of the cancerous lesion while achieving the best possible aesthetic outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare oncoplastic and non-oncoplastic procedures.",
        "A retrospective observational study was conducted on a group of patients who underwent oncoplastic or non-oncoplastic breast surgery at the Breast Unit of the University of Rome Tor Vergata.",
        "Out of 211 patients, 154 (73%) underwent non-oncoplastic surgery, while 61 (27%) underwent an oncoplastic procedure. The percentage of patients requiring re-excision was twice greater for women in the non-oncoplastic group: 12.9% vs. 6.5% in the oncoplastic group. The rate of complications was higher in the oncoplastic group compared to the non-oncoplastic one (4.9% vs. 1.3%). The size of the tumor, the number of the patients receiving post-operative radiation, the interval between surgery and radiotherapy and follow-up were similar between the two groups.",
        "Oncoplastic surgery represents a valid alternative to breast conserving surgery for patients with breast cancer, with only minimal differences in long-term complications and similar results in terms of local recurrence and number of metastasis."
