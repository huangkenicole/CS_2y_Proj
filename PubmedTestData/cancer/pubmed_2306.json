        "Actinic keratoses (AKs) are defined as intraepithelial proliferation of atypical keratinocytes. Given their potential for progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, they may eventually evolve into a life-threatening disease. In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of AKs, primarily due to changes in recreational activities and demographic trends in industrialized countries. As it is currently impossible to predict if and when a given AK might progress to invasive carcinoma, rigorous treatment of field cancerization is a key component in preventing potential progression. In addition to a broad armamentarium of procedures as well as pharmaceutical treatment options, primary prevention through diligent UV protection likewise plays a crucial role. New clinical, histomorphological, or molecular classifications are needed to be able to reliably stratify patients based on their individual risk. Especially in light of socio-economic aspects, such a step might prevent over- and undertreatment of an ever-growing patient population and help develop treatment concepts based on individual patient needs."
