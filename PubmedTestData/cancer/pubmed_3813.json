        "Pulmonary cancer can be diagnosed earlier if patients with pulmonary symptoms of chronic type are given x-ray examination early, if patients over 40 years of age have a yearly roentgen examination of the chest regardless of their state of health, and if those with acute pulmonary illness are examined by x-ray within one month of the onset of illness. Observation of a known intrapulmonary lesion of unknown character should never last for more than one month. If it persists after that period, complete investigation, including thoracotomy, should be carried out if necessary to establish an exact diagnosis. A localized intrapulmonary lesion can be removed by segmental resection so that all healthy functioning lung is conserved if the disease is benign. If, after pathological examination, the lesion is shown to be cancerous, more radical resection can be carried out."
