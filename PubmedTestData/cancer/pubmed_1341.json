        "Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, causing over half a million deaths a year in the USA alone. Despite recent advances made in the field of cancer biology and the therapies that have been developed [1, 2], it is clear that more advances are necessary for us to classify cancer as curable. The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems. In this chapter, we delve into the complexities of this adaptability and the vital role that metabolism plays in the rise and progression of this heterogeneity."
