        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts with sizes larger than 200 nucleotides and no/ small open reading frame that cannot produce functional proteins. The number of these transcripts surpasses the number of coding genes. LncRNAs regulate many aspects of cell functions such as proliferation, cell cycle transition and differentiation; so their dysregulation has pervasive effects on cell phenotype. Increasing numbers of these transcripts have been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of cancer. In the current review, we summarize recent findings regarding the role of lncRNAs in tumors originated from organs which have an endocrine function. We mostly focused on adrenal, pancreas and pituitary gland as prototypes of these organs. Moreover, we presented the obtained data of the role of lncRNAs in prostate, ovarian and testicular cancers. Recent data highly supports the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of cancers originated from these organs. Moreover, certain genomic loci within lncRNAs have been shown to be associated with risk of these cancers. Diagnostic and prognostic role of some lncRNAs in these cancers have been evaluated recently. Taken together, lncRNAs are putative biomarkers for cancers originated from organs which have an endocrine function."
