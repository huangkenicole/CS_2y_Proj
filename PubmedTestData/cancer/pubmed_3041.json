        "Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were studied in 20 patients with breast cancer (stage II) before surgery, one month after surgery, and after three years as a follow-up study. Data from 50 age-matched, normal healthy females, preferably from the affected families, served as controls. In each patient, 50 well-spread metaphases were scored for SCEs. The mean values of SCEs per metaphase were 5.80, 4.69, and 5.98 in breast cancer patients before surgery, one month after surgery, and after a gap of three years as a follow-up, respectively. The one-way analysis of variance was applied and it was found that there was a highly significant difference in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in these patients before surgery, one month after surgical removal of cancerous tissue, and after three years as a follow-up study. The elevated level of SCEs three years after surgical removal of cancerous tissue predict the chances of development of another type of cancer."
