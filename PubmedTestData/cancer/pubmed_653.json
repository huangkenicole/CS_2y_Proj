        "The incidence of breast cancer is high in the US, it accounts for 7.4% of all cancers in India, and it is one of the most common cancers among middle-aged women in many developing countries. Findings are presented from an evaluation of the total DNA content of breast tissue as a marker for the early diagnosis of breast cancer in women. Results are based upon the measurement of mean total DNA content in mg per g of wet breast tissue in 85 breast cancer patients and 170 controls. The control group comprised 85 patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and 85 healthy, normal women. The mean DNA content in the groups was determined to be 0.84 +or- 0.43 mg/g among normal controls, 4.76 +or- 2.37 mg/g among women with BBD, and 27.28 +or- 20.86 mg/g among cancer cases. The ranges for the respective groups were 0.2-1.75 mg/g, 0.7-10 mg/g, and 4.63-92.5 mg/g, indicating an absolute increase in the DNA content in gradient from normal to cancerous stage of breast tissue."
