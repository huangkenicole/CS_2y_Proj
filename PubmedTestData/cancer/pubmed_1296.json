        "As a principal matrisomal protein, collagen is involved in the regulation of the structural framework of extracellular matrix (ECM) and therefore is potentially crucial in determining the biophysical character of the ECM. It has been suggested that collagen architecture plays a role in ovarian cancer development, progression and therapeutic responses which led us to examine the collagen morphology in normal and cancerous ovarian tissue. Also, the behaviour of ovarian cancer cells cultured in four qualitatively different collagen gels was investigated. The results here provide evidence that collagen I morphology in the cancerous ovary is distinct from that in the normal ovary. Tumour-associated collagen I showed streams or channels of thick elongated collagen I fibrils. Moreover, fibril alignment was significantly more prevalent in endometrioid and clear cell cancers than other ovarian cancer subtypes. In this work, for the first-time collagen I architecture profiling (CAP) was introduced using histochemical staining, which distinguished between the collagen I morphologies of ovarian cancer subtypes. Immunohistochemical examination of ovarian normal and cancerous tissues also supported the notion that focal adhesion and Rho signalling are upregulated in ovarian cancers, especially in the high-grade serous tumours, as indicated by higher expression of p-FAK and p190RhoGEF. The results also support the concept that collagen I architecture, which might be collagen I concentration-dependent, influences proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. The study provides evidence that modification of collagen I architecture integrity is associated with ovarian cancer development and therapeutic responses."
