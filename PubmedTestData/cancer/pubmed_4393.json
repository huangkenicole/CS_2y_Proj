        "Lay abstract <i>NANOG</i> is a gene that is mainly expressed during development of the embryo. In adult tissues, <i>NANOG</i> is hardly expressed. In embryonal cells, NANOG is responsible for generating stem cells. Once the cells are differentiated into their specific function, they no longer need this renewing property. So\u00a0expression of NANOG in differentiated \u2018adult\u2019 cells is harmful as it\u00a0helps tumor cells to grow. <i>NANOG</i> expression also enables the tumor cells to keep on evolving their microenvironment, thus making it difficult for conventional therapy to destroy them. This review highlights the factors that influence NANOG\u2019s expression in cancer progression and chemoresistance and how it can be targeted for therapy."

        "The transcription factor NANOG regulates self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic cells, and its\u00a0downregulation leads to cell differentiation. Recent studies have linked upregulation of <i>NANOG</i> in various cancers and the regulation of expression of different molecules, and\u00a0<i>vice versa</i>, to induce proliferation, metastasis, invasion\u00a0and chemoresistance. Thus <i>NANOG</i> is an oncogene that functions by inducing stem cells'\u00a0circuitries\u00a0and heterogeneity in cancers. Understanding NANOG's role in various cancers may lead to it becoming a\u00a0therapeutic target to halt cancer progression. The\u00a0NANOG network can also be targeted to resensitize resistant cancer cells to conventional therapies. The current review focuses on NANOG regulation in the various signaling networks leading to cancer progression and chemoresistance, and\u00a0highlights the therapeutic aspect of targeting NANOG in various cancers."
