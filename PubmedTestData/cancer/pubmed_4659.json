        "Cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery worry about the impact of treatment on their future health as well as on their reproductive ability. Genetic counseling--focusing on the probability of later cancers, possible infertility, and the chance of having children who are affected--is vital for cured cancer patients. Since each type of cancer and each type of treatment has unique sequelae, genetic counselors must make a thorough review of the patient's environmental and family history. They must also be alert for cancer family syndromes, including cancers of the breast, ovary, and colon."
