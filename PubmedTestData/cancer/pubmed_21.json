        "Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2(MeCP2) is an important epigenetic regulatory factor that promotes many tumor developments, such as liver cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. So far, no pan-cancer analysis has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to explore pan-cancer's prognostic value, immune infiltration pattern, and biological function. We used bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression and prognostic significance of MeCP2, and the relationship between MeCP2 and clinicopathological parameters, genetic variation, methylation, phosphorylation, immune cell infiltration, and biological function in pan-cancer from using a public database. The results showed that expression of MeCP2 was up-regulated in 8 cancers and down-regulated in 2 cancers, which was remarkably correlated with the prognosis, pathological stage, grade and subtype of cancers. The promoter methylation level of MeCP2 DNA was decreased in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD);decreased phosphorylation of S25, S90, S92, S241, S286, S325 and S435 was found in MeCP2, such as UCEC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Furthermore, MeCP2 expression was significantly associated with multiple immunomodulators and immune cell infiltration levels across most tumors. Therefore, our pan-cancer explored the prognostic markers and immunotherapeutic value of MeCP2 in different cancers."
