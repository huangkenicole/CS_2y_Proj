        "p53 plays a central role in protecting the integrity of the genome. Its activity is ubiquitously lost in cancers, either by inactivation of its protein (p53 pathway) or by mutation in the p53 gene, thereby indicating its importance in understanding cancer and as a therapeutic target. Activated p53 is known to induce cell cycle arrest thereby leading to apoptosis and has been the subject of intensive research in the area of medicinal chemistry. Efforts are in progress to synthesize a variety of scaffolds that could inhibit the p53-Mdm2 interaction by binding to Mdm2 in the region where p53 is likely to bind. These molecules have the potential to be developed as anticancer drug candidates and have been largely explored by both academia and industry. Interestingly, some of these molecules are in the early stage of clinical trials.",
        "Areas covered in this review include patents relating to p53-Mdm2 inhibitors during the time period 2009 - 2010. The focus of the review was on small-molecule inhibitors.",
        "Inducing apoptosis in cancerous cells by the activation of p53 is an area that is being actively explored. There are strong indications that it could become a therapeutic method for the treatment of cancer. As a result, extensive research is being performed by both academia and industry. It is observed that small molecules that are present in early clinical trials are expected to be developed as potential drugs for cancer therapy."
