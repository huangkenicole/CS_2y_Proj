      "AbstractText": [
        "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a malignancy whose incidence is increasing, is frequently encountered in general nephrology practice when acute and chronic kidney disease occurs in the course of disease. Importantly, when kidney disease develops in the setting of RCC, mortality is significantly increased with patients often dying of a non-cancer-related complication of kidney disease. As such, practicing nephrologists need to have a working knowledge of this cancer's biology, treatment, and complications. Nephrologists should be involved in all aspects of the care of patients with RCC including in the acute setting prior to nephrectomy and in the chronic setting for patients with post-nephrectomy chronic kidney disease and those receiving potentially nephrotoxic anti-cancer agents. This collaborative approach to RCC care will hopefully improve patient outcomes."
