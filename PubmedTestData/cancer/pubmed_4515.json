        "Women diagnosed with breast cancer display higher propensity to develop second primary cancer in the contralateral breast (CBC). Identification of patients with increased risk of CBC and understanding relationships between hormone receptor (HR) statuses of the first and second breast cancers is desirable for endocrine-based prevention strategies.",
        "Using 1992-2012 data from 13 SEER registries, the risk of developing CBC was determined as ratio of observed and expected second breast cancers (SIR). Association between HR statuses was examined by exploratory data analysis and multivariable logistic regression.",
        "Women with ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers have increased risk of developing CBC with SIR values 2.09 (CI 95\u00a0=\u00a01.97-2.21) and 2.40 (CI 95\u00a0=\u00a02.18-2.63), respectively. ER statuses of the CBC are moderately positively associated. In metachronous CBC, most cases with ER-positive first cancers had ER-positive second breast cancers (81.6\u00a0%; CI 95\u00a0=\u00a080.2-82.9\u00a0%); however, considerable proportion of cases with ER-negative first cancers had ER-positive second cancers (48.8\u00a0%; CI 95\u00a0=\u00a046.2-51.4\u00a0%).",
        "Some women with ER-negative breast cancers may benefit from endocrine-based prevention of ER-positive CBC."
