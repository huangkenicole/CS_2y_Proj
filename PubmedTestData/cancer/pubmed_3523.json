        "Head and neck cancer remains a common cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and throughout the world. In spite of advances in the management of patients with advanced disease, overall survival in this group remains poor. Furthermore, although cancer mortality is lower in patients with early-stage disease, treatment results in significant morbidity, and these patients also face the risk of developing a second primary tumor. Chemoprevention is an innovative approach to decrease overall cancer morbidity and mortality using substances that are capable of preventing cancer progression. Head and neck cancer is an excellent model for chemoprevention, as its biology is consistent with the two concepts important for the development of chemoprevention strategies: field cancerization and multistep carcinogenesis. Several classes of compounds have been evaluated in chemoprevention trials. The most frequently studied agents, the retinoids, were found frequently to induce remissions in patients with oral leukoplakia. Furthermore, retinoids prevented progression to malignancy in one randomized maintenance study. Other agents, including beta-carotene and vitamin E, have been found also to have activity in the management of oral leukoplakia. However, the clinical role of chemopreventive agents in reducing cancer mortality remains to be defined. Two studies, one in head and neck cancer and one in lung cancer, have shown the ability of retinoids to prevent the development of second primary tumors. Current large randomized trials are defining the effectiveness of these agents in reducing the mortality of aerodigestive tract tumors in individuals at high risk."
