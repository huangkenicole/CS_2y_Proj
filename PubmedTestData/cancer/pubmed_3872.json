        "Using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we previously demonstrated that the S100C protein remarkably decreased after immortalization of normal human fibroblasts, and that this protein caused growth inhibition of human tumor cells when forcibly expressed in these cells, suggesting that S100C plays a significant role in tumor suppression. The present study was carried out to determine what type of human tissues express S100C protein, and, subsequently, whether the S100C content in these tissues changes after normal cells have been transformed into cancer cells. We found that ductal cells in various tissues were positively stained with the S100C protein. In comparison, epithelial cells in digestive organs such as the stomach, small intestine, and colon were not stained as strongly. When 14 pairs of human normal and cancerous tissues were stained with the antibody, decreases in the staining levels of S100C were observed in 6 kinds of cancerous tissues--from the bronchus, mammary duct, renal tubule, prostate, uterus, and testis--in comparison with staining in their normal counterparts. These results suggest that S100C is a new tumor marker protein, the expression of which significantly decreases after malignant transformation of human tissues."
