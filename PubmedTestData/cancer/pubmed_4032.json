        "HMGB1(High mobility group box 1), originally described as a nuclear protein, is now regarded as a multifunctional protein with a paradoxical dual effect in tumors. In the present study, HMGB1 overexpression and its correlation with the clinicopathologic characteristics and recurrence-free survival were evaluated in gastric adenocarcinomas.",
        "76 gastric adenocarcinomas surgically removed entered the study. The immunohistochemical staining was used to assess HMGB1 expression through tissue microarray procedure. The clinicopathologic characteristics of all patients were recorded, and the regular follow-up was made for all patients.",
        "Almost all the gastric adenocarcinomas showed HMGB1 positive staining mainly in the nucleus, and the overexpression of HMGB1 was found in cancerous tissues with higher strong reactivity rate, compared with non-cancerous tissues (total expression score >or= 9, 42.0% vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001). Survival analysis revealed that tumor stage negatively correlated with cancer-free survival (P = 0.022). Furthermore, HMGB1 overexpression positively associated with cancer-free survival of resectable gastric adenocarcinomas (P = 0.023).",
        "The overexpression of HMGB1 protein indicates that HMGB1 may play a role in the tumorigenesis of gastric adenocarcinomas. And the overexpression of HMGB1 may be a marker of good prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma given curative resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy."
