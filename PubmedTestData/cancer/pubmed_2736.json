        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the liver with poor prognosis. In order to improve the prognosis and overall survival of patients with HCC, it is important to identify it at early stage and resect it precisely. Cell microenvironment, active compounds, and enzymes may change during the cancerization of hepatocytes. Hypochlorous acid (HClO), one of the most significant signal molecules in the cellular signaling pathway, plays an important role in many cellular processes. To detect and treat liver cancers, it is imperative to study how HClO levels change in hepatocytes. However, developing fluorescent probes specific to liver cells to detect HClO still challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a NIR hepatocyte-specific fluorescent probe (MBH-MT) that displayed excellent optical properties for detecting HClO in biological samples. Cell imaging experiment conducted with the unique probe MBH-MT, showed that the biocompatible sensor is capable of monitoring HClO and distinguishing normal cells from cancer cells (e.g., HepG2, HUVEC, RAW264.7, L02 and HK-2\u00a0cells). An organ imaging experiment with the probe MBH-MT demonstrated its effectiveness in diagnosing and imaging hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo. MBH-MT's in situ imaging also demonstrated that it can target and image mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Furthermore, MBH-MT has also successfully been used to diagnose and guide liver cancer surgery early. In the future, we expect that this powerful tool may be help in the detection and imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma, which may affect a large number of people."
