      "AbstractText": [
        "The expression of midkine (MK), a growth/differentiation factor, was assessed in 34 surgically resected specimens of primary breast cancer or mastopathy. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, all of the non-cancerous and cancerous tissues were found to express MK except for one breast cancer specimen. Northern blot analysis revealed that MK mRNA was also expressed in the normal breast tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of the MK protein was performed on a limited number of the specimens, showing that some cancerous tissues were immunoreactive with anti-MK antibodies. Furthermore, using RT-PCR analysis, expression of not only the wild-type but also a truncated form of MK, which was recently found in various human tumor cell lines, was detected in 6 of 26 cancerous tissues but not in non-cancerous tissues."
