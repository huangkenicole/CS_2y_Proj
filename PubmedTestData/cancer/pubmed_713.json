        "We examined whether cancers frequently occur in hemodialysis patients, and therefore, investigated the features and outcomes of hemodialysis patients who had undergone surgery for non-small cell lung cancer.",
        "Between 1995 and 2011, 14 hemodialysis patients with lung cancer (8 males and 6 females) with a mean age of 67.0\u00a0years successfully underwent pulmonary resection at our institution. We investigated the 5-year survival rate and causes of death. The occurrence of multiple primary cancers in our patients and other lung-cancer patients reported in the articles were statistically compared by Chi-square test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",
        "The 5-year survival rate was 47.3\u00a0%, and six patients had died before our investigation. Four of the six had died of non-cancerous diseases related to hemodialysis. Five of 14 patients had a history of other primary cancers in other organs, and this incidence rate of multiple primary cancers was significantly higher than in other lung-cancer patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0071).",
        "The frequency of cancer in hemodialysis patients can be underestimated because of their early deaths by non-cancerous diseases. However, the incidence rate of multiple primary cancers may represent a unique characteristic of such patients."
