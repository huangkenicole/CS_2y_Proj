        "We evaluated the efficacy of the long-term follow-up of patients who underwent radical esophagectomy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to screen for recurrence and new primary malignancies.",
        "We retrospectively collected 448 ESCC patients who underwent radical esophagectomy. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, computed tomography, a stool test and the assessment of the serum concentration of squamous cell carcinoma antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen were performed annually, even over 5 years after esophagectomy. The incidence of ESCC recurrence and new primary malignancies was investigated.",
        "We enrolled 222 patients who survived at least 5\u00a0years after esophagectomy. A total of 104 new primary malignancies occurred in 82 patients (36.9%) after esophagectomy. Twenty-one malignancies were in the head and neck region, 14 in the residual esophagus, 13 in the prostate and 11 in the gastric tube and lung. Patients who developed new primary malignancies after esophagectomy had a significantly higher Brinkman index than those without new malignancies. An endoscopic approach successfully treated 92.9% of carcinomas in the residual esophagus, 90.9% of cancers in the gastric tube and 42.9% of carcinomas in the head and neck region.",
        "The incidence of new primary malignancies was higher than the age-standardized incidence. Long-term follow-up and systemic screening may increase the probability of an early diagnosis and subsequent low-invasive treatment."
