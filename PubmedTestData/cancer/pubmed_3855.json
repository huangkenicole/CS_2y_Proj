        "Photomedicine has long been used for treating cancerous diseases. With advances in chemical and material sciences, various types of light-activated photosensitizers (PSs) have been developed for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, conventional organic/inorganic materials-based PSs lack disease recognition capability and show limited therapeutic effects in addition to side effects. Recently, intelligent dynamic nanoassemblies that are activated in a tumor environment have been extensively researched to target diseased tissues more effectively, for increasing therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing side effects. This paper presents the latest dynamic nanoassemblies for effective PDT or PTT and combination phototherapies, including immunotherapy and image-guided therapy. Dynamic self-assembly exhibits great potential for clinical translation in diagnosis and treatment through its integrated versatility. Nanoassemblies based on multidisciplinary technology are a promising technique for treating incurable cancerous diseases in the future."
