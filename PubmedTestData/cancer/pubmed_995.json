        "The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) represents a national electronic registry system now encompassing almost 60% of incident cancers in the United States. In combination with other programs of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, the NCDB offers a working example of voluntary, accurate, and cost-effective \"outcomes management\" on a both a local and a national scale.",
        "For the accession years 1985-1993, the NCDB has obtained information on demographics, patterns of care, disease stage, treatment, and outcome for a convenience sample of 57,407 gastric carcinoma cases (1.6% of total NCDB cases). In addition to describing trends, this report focuses on 5-year relative survival for a cohort of 1987-1988 cases staged according to the third edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer's TNM classification, as well as patterns of care for a cohort of 1992-1993 cases.",
        "Stage-stratified 5-year relative survival for the 1987-1988 cohort was as follows: IA, 71%; IB, 56%; II, 37%; IIIA, 18%; IIIB, 11%; IV, 5%. Without noteworthy changes in stage distribution, demographics, or other factors, the proportion of patients treated by total gastrectomy is increasing slightly, but proximal gastrectomy for proximal cancers remains surprisingly popular. The proportion of cases receiving postoperative adjuvant treatment has declined slightly. Presumably because of advanced age and/or medical infirmity, a substantial proportion of U.S. patients with disease at every stage receive no treatment for cancer.",
        "This analysis of patterns of care has revealed unexplained variations in treatment and opportunities for improvement. Treatment of the elderly, infirm patient with gastric carcinoma appears problematic."
