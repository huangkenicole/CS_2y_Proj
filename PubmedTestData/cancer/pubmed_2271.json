        "To observe the relationship between the pit patterns and pathology and compare the curative effect for colon flat lesion between endoscopic mucosa resection (EMR) and fulguration with high frequency current (FHFC).",
        "They were divided to two groups. There were 37 cases for FHFC in group A, and 34 cases for EMR in Group B. The two groups were comparabal. Examining patients suffering with colon flat lesions with magnifying endoscope and observing the pit patterns of mucosa after staining with indicarmine.",
        "The pit patterns of inflammatory or hyperplastic lesions were mainly pit II, adenoma pit III and pit IV, and carcinomatous lesions pit IV and pit V. The worse the differentiation degree of lesions was, the higher the pit patterns were. There were no difference (P > 0.05) between group A and B in complication and quantity, classification and distribution of lesions. No canceration was detected in 21 cases with adenoma in group A, while 4 cases of canceration (all were adenocacinoma) was found in 20 cases whith adenoma in group B. There was significance in canceration between two groups (P < 0.05).",
        "The worse the differentiation degree of lesions was, the higher pit patterns were. EMR and FHFC share the same validity and security when treating the flat lesions, but by EMR, doctors could judge whether the lesions were resected completely, once the remained lesions were found, they could be resected immediately again lesion in case of omission of canceration."
