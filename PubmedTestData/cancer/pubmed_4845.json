        "Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 2 (TACC2) is a member of TACC family proteins which is mainly involved in the stabilization of spindles and regulation of microtubule dynamics through interactions with molecules involved in centrosomes/microtubules. TACC2 is involved in tumorigenesis of variety of cancers but the clinical significance of TACC2 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear.",
        "This study aims to investigate the expression of TACC2 in HCC and determine if clinical significance and prognostic relevance exists.",
        "We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot to examine TACC2 mRNA and protein expression in paired HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 106 postoperative HCC samples.",
        "There was higher expression of TACC2 protein and mRNA in HCC tissue. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed high expression of TACC2 in HCC tissue and was significantly associated with the capsular extension, tumor recurrence and shortened overall and disease free survival. The Cox regression analysis suggested that a high expression of TACC2 was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients.",
        "This finding suggests that TACC2 may be a useful tool as a candidate biomarker to predict the recurrence and prognosis of HCC."
