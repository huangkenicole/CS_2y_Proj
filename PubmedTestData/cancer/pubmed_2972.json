        "PSA blood test and other present screening tools fail to provide the required sensitivity and specificity and, at early stages, lack correlation with tumor grade, volume, and location. Thus alternative approaches are highly desired. We present and assess a novel method for PCa detection, grading, volume evaluation and tumor location, based on non-invasive zinc concentration mapping in the gland by means of a dedicated rectal probe.",
        "Zinc-concentration values measured in histologically examined tissue fragments from needle biopsy of 598 patients were analyzed. They were used to generate computer simulated zinc-concentration maps, further analyzed with image-processing tools. The tumor detection performances versus Gleason grade were assessed.",
        "A significant increase of zinc depletion with increasing Gleason pattern (grade) classification was established. Tumor detection performance in zinc-concentration maps progressively improves with the cancer's first component score. Reliable information on the location, size and Gleason-grade combination of the lesion can be extracted for clinically relevant volumes.",
        "Zinc depletion in the prostate peripheral zone is the basis for a novel, non-invasive PCa detection, localization, volume evaluation and grading method. Its realization and application as a pre-biopsy and pre-treatment examination, or a follow-up tool, relies on the development of a dedicated transrectal probe. It should have significant impact on biopsy effectiveness, point at a possible extraprostatic extension and provide critical data for focal treatment. The information on tumor grade and distribution may have an important impact on disease management."
