        "The development of novel treatments for breast invasive carcinoma (BC) has been stagnant. P2RX1, a member of the purinergic receptor family, has been found to have a prognostic impact in several tumors. Therefore, we analyzed the expression pattern of P2RX1 in pan-cancers including BC and its impact on survival and found that the expression level of P2RX1 was lower in BC compared with para-cancerous tissues, and higher P2RX1 expression indicated better prognoses. But real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot detected that the P2RX1 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells was lower than that in tumor cells. Then we comprehensively analyzed the regulatory mechanism and protein-protein interaction network, and found that P2RX1 was significantly positively linked with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints."
