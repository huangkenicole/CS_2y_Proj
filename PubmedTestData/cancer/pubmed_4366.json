      "AbstractText": [
        "Commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used for oestrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor determination in the cytosol fraction of 118 human larynx cancer specimens and in the corresponding histologically proven non-malignant tissues. Fifty-one ER positive cancerous samples had corresponding non-cancerous tissues also expressing the receptor. A high resolution isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique followed by immunoblotting with the H222 anti-ER monoclonal antibody was used to evaluate the presence of ER isoforms in the 51 ER positive human larynx cancer specimens and in their corresponding non-malignant tissues. In both tissues, four ER isoforms were detected, with isoelectric points (pI) similar to those obtained in breast and endometrium carcinomas (6.1, 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8). A significant difference in the expression of ER isoforms between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue was found; precisely, the 94.1% of the ER positive non-malignant specimens co-expressed the four isoforms while they were detected in only the 35.5% of the malignant specimens (P < 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). In larynx cancer, the concentration values of ER and PR did not correlate, nevertheless tumours co-expressing the four ER isoforms had PR levels significantly higher than those which did not (P = 0.02 by Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon sum rank test). To investigate the possibility that the isoforms of the monomeric 4S form of the ER (those with pI 6.3, 6.6, and 6.8) could dimerise, a cold agarose gel electrophoresis technique was used on IEF-separated ER isoforms. In summary, the evidence shows that all the isoforms are able to form homodimers and that the isoforms at pI 6.3 and 6.8 are able to dimerise with that at pI 6.6 but, under the same experimental conditions, they do not form the 6.3/6.8 heterodimer. It was concluded that: (1) the four isoforms of the ER are co-expressed by the non-malignant human larynx and the cancer loses the capacity to express some of them; (2) the complete complement of ER isoforms (all four) is needed for PR expression; (3) the monomeric 4S isoform with pI 6.6 has the capacity to form homo- and heterodimers, while the remaining two are only able to homodimerise."
