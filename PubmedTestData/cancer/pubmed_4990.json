        "The tissue distribution of 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted dibenzo-p-dioxins was conducted in 11 patients who died of cancer. The concentration of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (octa-CDD) was the highest in each organ and tissue and hepta-CDD was also found at relatively high levels, second only to OCDD. The levels of 1,2,3, 7,8-penta-CDD and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexa-CDD in the spleen were the highest, respectively. 2,3,7,8-Tetra-CDD was also detected and its concentration was the highest in the gonad (0.8-3.2 pg/g-range). From the 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent calculations, the highest equivalent value was obtained from a 54-year-old female who died of cancerous goiter. This individual had the highest concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted penta- and hexa-CDDs among the 11 patients."
