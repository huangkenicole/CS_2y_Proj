        "Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) was reported to play a key role in the development of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The process of EMT is regulated by the changes of miRNAs expression. However, it is still unknown which miRNA changed the most in the process of canceration and whether these changes played a role in tumor development.",
        "A total of 36 SCLC patients treated in our hospital between 11th, 2015 and 10th, 2017 were enrolled. The samples of cancer tissues and paracancer tissues of patients were collected and analyzed. Then, the miRNAs in normal lung cells and NSCLC cells were also analyzed. In the presence of TGF-\u03b2, we transfected the miRNA mimics or inhibitor into NSCLC cells to investigate the role of the significantly altered miRNAs in cell migration and invasion and in the process of EMT.",
        "MiR-330-3p was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC cell lines and tissues and miRNA- 205 was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Transfected miRNA-205 mimics or miRMA-330-3p inhibitor inhibited the migration and invasion of NCIH1975 cell and restrained TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in NSCLC cells.",
        "miRNA-330-3p and miRNA-205 changed the most in the process of canceration in NSCLC. Furthermore, miR-330-3p promoted cell invasion and metastasis in NSCLC probably by promoting EMT and miR-205 could restrain NSCLC likely by suppressing EMT."
