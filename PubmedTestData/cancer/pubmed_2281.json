        "Malignancies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rapidly spreading and commonly fatal. Like most cancers, the gene expression patterns in HCC vary significantly from patient to patient. Moreover, the expression networks during HCC progression are largely controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating multiple oncogenes and tumor supressors. Therefore, miRNA-based therapeutic strategies altering these networks may significantly influence the cellular behavior enough for them to cure HCC. However, the most substantial challenges in developing such therapies are the stability of the oligos themselves and that of their delivery systems. Here we provide a comprehensive update describing various miRNA delivery systems, including virus-based delivery and non-viral delivery. The latter may be achieved using inorganic nanoparticles, polymer based nano-carriers, lipid-based vesicles, exosomes, and liposomes. Leaky vasculature in HCC-afflicted livers helps untargeted nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumor tissue but may result in side effects during higher dose of treatment. On the other hand, the strategies for actively targeting miRNA therepeutics to cancerous cells through nano-conjugates or vesicles by decorating their surface with antibodies against or ligands for HCC-specific antigens or receptors are more efficient in preventing damage to healthy tissue and cancer recurrence."
