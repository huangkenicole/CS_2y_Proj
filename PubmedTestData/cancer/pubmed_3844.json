        "The salvage brachytherapy performed in patients presenting velotonsillar carcinoma in a previously irradiated field is evaluated in terms of local control, complications and survival.",
        "Between 1976 and 1990, 73 patients presenting with velotonsillar squamous cell carcinoma in a previously irradiated area were treated at Center Alexis Vautrin with brachytherapy along using an 192Ir implant (afterloading technique) with curative intent. According to the UICC 1987 TNM classification, there were 45 T1 N0, 20 T2 N0, one T3 NO, one T3 N2 and six Tx Nx.",
        "The 5-year actuarial local control for T1 N0 and T2 N0 are 80% and 67% respectively. The regional relapse rate was 10% in both groups. Grade 2 complications occurred in 13% of patients and these were neither related to the volume treated nor the dose rate. There were no Grade 3 or 4 complications. The 5-year specific survival is 64%, with a plateau after the 5th year, but the 5-year overall survival is only 30%. Fourty-two percent of the patients in this series died from another carcinoma. All but two of these were related to continued alcohol and tobacco intoxication.",
        "We conclude that brachytherapy alone (60 Gy) is optimal treatment for patients presenting with velontonsillar carcinoma in a previously irradiated field. The greatest challenge is the screening of these patients and the prevention of subsequent head and neck cancers. Recognizing the fact that these patients are at high risk for subsequent malignancies of upper aerodigestive tract, lung and esophagus, close surveillance is necessary for: (a) early diagnosis and prompt treatment; and (b) development of prevention strategies of field cancerization."
