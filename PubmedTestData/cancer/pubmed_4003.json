        "Cancer is considered a complicated health issue worldwide. The mean cancer survival through standard therapeutic strategies has not been significantly improved over the past few decades. Hence, alternate remedies are needed to treat or prevent this dreadful disease being explored. Currently, it has been recognized that repeated treatment with chemotherapeutic agents has been largely ineffective due to multidrug resistance and further conventional treatment possesses limited drug accessibility to cancerous tissues, which in turn necessitates a higher dose resulting in increased cytotoxicity. Drug combinations have been practiced to address the problems associated with conventional single drug treatment. Recently, natural dietary agents have attracted much attention in cancer therapy because of their synergistic effects with anticancer drugs against different types of cancer. Natural phytochemicals may execute their anticancer activity through targeting diverse cancer cell signaling pathways, promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, regulating antioxidant status and detoxification. This review focuses mainly on the anticancer efficacy of dietary phytochemicals in combination with standard therapeutic drugs reported from various in vitro and in vivo experimental studies apart from clinical trials. This review adds knowledge to the field of intervention studies using combinational modalities that opens a new window for cancer treatment/chemoprevention."
