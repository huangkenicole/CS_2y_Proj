        "The purpose of our study was to examine the expression pattern of apoptosis-related genes in normal and cancerous ovaries of the hen. Localization of apoptosis-related gene mRNA was investigated in cancerous ovaries using in situ hybridization. The expression patterns of apoptosis-related genes were confirmed with RT-PCR in normal and cancerous ovaries. Differences of expression level between normal ovaries and ovarian cancers were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. In both normal and cancerous chicken ovaries, the expression of CASP1, CASP2, CASP3, CASP6, CASP8 and CASP9 were detected through RT-PCR analysis. The expression of BCL2, BCL2L1 and BID were confirmed in normal and cancerous ovaries of the hen. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that CASP1 expression was significantly increased in cancerous ovaries compared with normal ovaries, whereas BID expression was decreased. Our results showed a resistance to removal of abnormal cells via apoptosis in cancerous ovaries of the hen. Collectively, this phenomenon is closely associated with the dysregulation of CASP1 and BID expression in chicken ovarian cancer."
