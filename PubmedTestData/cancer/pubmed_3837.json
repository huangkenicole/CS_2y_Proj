        "Discovering novel cancer therapies has attracted extreme interest in the last decade. In this regard, multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapies is a key challenge in cancer treatment. Cancerous cells are growingly become resistant to existing chemotherapeutics by employing diverse mechanisms, highlighting the significance of discovering approaches to overcome MDR. One promising strategy is utilizing aptamers as unique tools to target elements or signaling pathways incorporated in resistance mechanisms, or develop actively targeted drug delivery systems or chimeras enabling the precise delivery of novel agents to inhibit the conventionally undruggable resistance elements. Furthermore, due to their advantages over their proteinaceous counterparts, particularly antibodies, including improved targeting action, enhanced thermal stability, easier production, and superior tumor penetration, aptamers are emerging and have frequently been considered for developing cancer therapeutics. Here, we highlighted significant chemoresistance pathways in cancer and discussed the use of aptamers as prospective tools to surmount cancer MDR."
