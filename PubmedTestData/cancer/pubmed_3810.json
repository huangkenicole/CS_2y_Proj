        "Determining the risk that a particular area of hyperplastic breast tissue will progress to cancer is difficult and is currently expressed only as a general risk factor within the population. Using an antibody against the apoptotic purinergic receptor P2X7, we examined 40 cases each of the following histological categories: normal, moderate, florid and atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. These were previously diagnosed by H&E and supplied by clinical laboratories as tissue sections. Normal and mildly hyperplastic epithelium was devoid of the cytolytic P2X7 receptors whereas all epithelial cells in all cases of in situ or invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma labelled intensely. The lobular and ductal in situ cases labelled intracellularly while the invasive epithelial cancer cells showed intense cell surface label indicating an attempt was being made to induce apoptosis. All these receptors however are non-functional and thus unable to induce apoptosis. Approximately 10% of all hyperplastic lobules examined in the biopsied tissue, regardless of H&E classification, labelled for P2X7, which is suggestive of early metabolic cancerous change. The acini within lobules were either completely labelled with P2X7 or were completely devoid of the receptor. A potential advantage of this method lies in identifying early cancerous change in hyperplastic lobules and in establishing the true extent of cancerous spread in infiltrating lesions, thus facilitating the task of reporting clear surgical margins."
