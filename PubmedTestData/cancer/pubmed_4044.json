        "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a common salivary gland malignancy characterized by slow but progressive clinical course, proclivity for hematogenous spread and perineural invasion (PNI) that exhibits inherent resistance to complete surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy. The molecular alterations that underlie its PNI are poorly characterized. We report the combined use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and high-throughput cDNA microarray to monitor in vivo gene expression profile of salivary ACC and to correlate the profile with PNI. Consecutive section staining with hematoxylin & eosin was applied to 15 cancerous tissues, among which 6 were judged as PNI. Pure cancer cells adjacent to the nerve tracts from 6 cancerous tissues judged as PNI were laser captured, and pure cancer cells from the same 6 tumors distant from the nerve tracts were also procured. Total RNA was extracted, amplified and subjected to cDNA microarray-based expression analysis. The patterns of gene expression were verified by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. As to the result of 6 arrays, a total of 53 genes were identified as being 2-fold or more differentially expressed in PNI cancer cell group as compared to non-PNI cancer cell control. Out of the 53 genes found consistently differentially expressed, 38 were up-regulated and 15 down-regulated. The combined use of LCM and cDNA microarray analysis provides a powerful new approach to monitor the in vivo molecular events of PNI in salivary ACC. These identified novel genes deserve further investigations to elucidate their clinicopathological significance."
