        "Mammograms and breast examinations are established methods for early breast cancer detection. Routine mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality among women ages > or = 50 years, but additional screening methods are needed. We and others have found high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in nipple aspirate fluids (NAFs), but the usefulness for these bio-markers for early breast cancer detection is unknown.",
        "NAFs from one or both breasts of 388 women were analyzed for CEA, PSA, and albumin levels. The study included 44 women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers, 67 women with proliferative breast lesions (ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical ductal hyperplasia), and 277 controls without these breast lesions. Analyses were conducted using the log(10)-transformed CEA and PSA levels to normalize the distributions of these tumor markers.",
        "Nipple fluid CEAs are significantly higher for cancerous breasts than tumor-free breasts (median 1,830 and 1,400 ng/mL, respectively; P <.01). However, at 90% specificity of the assay (CEA = 11,750 ng/mL), the corresponding sensitivity for cancer detection is 32%. CEA levels are not significantly different for breasts with proliferative lesions compared with tumor-free breasts. Nipple fluid PSAs do not differ by tumor status. Analyses of NAF albumin-standardized CEAs and PSAs yield similar results. Nipple fluid CEA and PSA titers are correlated in the affected and unaffected breast of women with unilateral lesions.",
        "Nipple fluid CEAs are higher for breasts with untreated invasive cancers, but the test sensitivity is low. Nipple fluid PSA titers do not seem to be useful for breast cancer detection."
