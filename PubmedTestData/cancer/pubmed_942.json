        "To explore the psychosocial needs of cancer patients and survivors across the United States and their implications for value-based oncology.",
        "A secondary analysis of findings from a cross-sectional national online survey.",
        "Respondents were sampled and stratified by cancer type and geographic region to approximate the cancer-affected population of the United States. Breast, prostate, and colorectal were the most common cancers reported. Across surveys, the majority of respondents were female (57%), over 55 (60%), and white (70%) and had at least some college (36%).",
        "Six online surveys were administered to cohorts of approximately 500 unique cancer patients and survivors. Survey topics included: (1) diagnosis, (2) treatment planning, (3) communication with providers, (4) insurance and financial concerns, (5) quality of life, side effects, and symptoms, and (6) survivorship and end-of-life. Descriptive analyses were used to explore psychosocial needs and experiences across three domains of patient-centered value in oncology.",
        "Each survey received 500-527 responses. Respondents most commonly reported needing more information regarding their insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs (65%), access to clinical trials (89%), and support organizations (45%). Forty-one percent were very or extremely distressed about cancer's impact on their ability to work and over 25% reported high-levels of cancer-related financial hardship.",
        "Patients and survivors reported significant unmet informational needs, financial hardship, distress, and symptoms or treatment side effects that interfered with daily life. Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: Providers and payment reform advocates can improve value in oncology by ensuring access to comprehensive psychosocial care and informational support."
