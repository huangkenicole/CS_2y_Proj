        "Transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) is a type-II transmembrane serine protease that plays an important role in the migration of cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate both the expression of TMPRSS4 and its clinical significance in prostate cancer. The expression of TMPRSS4 was evaluated in 73 pairs of prostate cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry. The level of TMPRSS4 in prostate cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High TMPRSS4 expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage and LNM. No association between TMPRSS4 expression and progression-free survival was observed in all patients. Stratified analyses according to clinical features revealed that patients with low TMPRSS4 expression had poor prognosis compared with those with high TMPRSS4 expression in subjects not receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, TMPRSS4 showed abnormal expression in prostate cancer tissues. TMPRSS4 may be a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
