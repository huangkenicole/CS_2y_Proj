        "Wnt signaling is important for breast development and remodeling during pregnancy and lactation. Epigenetic modifications change expression levels of components of the Wnt pathway, underlying oncogenic transformation. However, no clear Wnt component increasing expression universally across breast cancer (BC) or its most Wnt-dependent triple-negative BC (TNBC) subgroup has been identified, delaying development of targeted therapies. Here we perform network correlation analysis of expression of >100 Wnt pathway components in hundreds of healthy and cancerous breast tissues. Varying in expression levels among people, Wnt components remarkably coordinate their production; this coordination is dramatically decreased in BC. Clusters with coordinated gene expression exist within the healthy cohort, highlighting Wnt signaling subtypes. Different BC subgroups are identified, characterized by different remaining Wnt signaling signatures, providing the rational for patient stratification for personalizing the therapeutic applications. Key pairwise interactions within the Wnt pathway (some inherited and some established de novo) emerge as targets for future drug discovery against BC."
