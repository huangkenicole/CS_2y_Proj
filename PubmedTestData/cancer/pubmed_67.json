        "Cancer development is a multistep process in which cells must overcome a series of obstacles before they can become fully developed tumors. First, cells must develop the ability to proliferate unchecked. Once this is accomplished, they must be able to invade the neighboring tissue, as well as provide themselves with oxygen and nutrients. Finally, they must acquire the ability to detach from the newly formed mass in order to spread to other tissues, all the while evading an immune system that is primed for their destruction. Furthermore, increased levels of inflammation have been shown to be linked to the development of cancer, with sites of chronic inflammation being a common component of tumorigenic microenvironments. In this Review, we give an overview of the impact of sphingolipid metabolism in cancers, from initiation to metastatic dissemination, as well as discussing immune responses and resistance to treatments. We explore how sphingolipids can either help or hinder the progression of cells from a healthy phenotype to a cancerous one."
