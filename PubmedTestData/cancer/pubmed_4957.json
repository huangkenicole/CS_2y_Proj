        "Radical cystectomy (RC) with lymph node dissection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and high risk non-MIBC. The American Joint Committee on Cancer's (AJCC) node staging and lymph node ratio (LNR) systems are used in estimating prognosis; however, they do not directly factor in negative dissected nodes. In this study, we evaluated the log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS), a novel measure of nodal involvement, as a predictor of survival.",
        "Eighty-three patients who underwent RC were retrospectively included and their demographic and clinical data were collected. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression were used for survival analyses.",
        "Median number of dissected lymph nodes was 13 (range 3-45). ROC curve analysis indicated -0.92 as the optimal LODDS cutoff. LODDS > -0.92 was associated with higher T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and significantly worse overall survival (OS) (mean OS 18.6 vs. 45.1 months, P-value < .001). Furthermore, we evaluated AJCC node staging, LNR, and LODDS in three separate multivariable Cox regression models. Among 3 different measures of nodal disease burden, only LODDS was an independent predictor of OS (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.28-5.73, P\u00a0=\u00a0.009).",
        "Our results show that LODDS is an independent predictor of OS and outperforms AJCC node staging and LNR in forecasting prognosis among patients with urothelial bladder cancer who undergo RC."
