        "Introduction: There is a high burden of cervical cancer in Cambodia, yet published data on the prevalence of cervical dysplasia and the risk factors contributing to the development of pre-cancerous lesions in Cambodian women is very limited. In addition, as it is well known that HIV positivity increases cervical cancer risk, it is important to quantify the prevalence of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma among Cambodian women living with HIV disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 499 HIV+ and 501 HIV- Cambodian women at the Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE. Visual inspection with 5% acetic acid was the method of screening. Colposcopy was performed on all VIA+ patients, and subsequent treatment followed WHO guidelines. Logistic regression models, stratified by both HIV+ and HIV- groups, were used to assess significant factors associated with having dysplasia. Results: VIA+ results were prevalent in both the HIV+ and HIV- arms of the study. The HIV+ patients were more likely to have a lower age at coitarche, lower weight, 2 or more lifetime sexual partners, two or greater pregnancies, or be unmarried. The estimated prevalence of VIA detected cervical dysplasia was 11% for the entire study sample, 13.4% in the HIV positive (HIV+) group and 8.6% in the HIV negative (HIV-) group (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.48; p=0.01). For the HIV+ group, having a history of 4 or more full-term pregnancies (OR: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.01-11.64; p=0.049) was found to be significantly associated with having an increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia in the multivariate model. Conclusion: Cervical dysplasia is prevalent in both HIV positive and negative Cambodian women and a VIA based national screening programs need to be developed and expanded to provide access to affordable and effective treatment for cervical dysplasia and cancers."
