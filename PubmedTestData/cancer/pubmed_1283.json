        "To evaluate ductal lavage (DL) performance in women with known breast cancer and to assess cell yield from contralateral high-risk breasts.",
        "Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer were offered study participation. They underwent bilateral nipple aspiration, followed by DL of those ducts demonstrating nipple aspiration fluid (NAF) production. The procedures were conducted in the operating room prior to definitive surgery. Samples were interpreted masked as to which breast was malignant, and the interpretation used a 5-category scheme: insufficient, benign, mildly atypical, markedly atypical or malignant.",
        "A total of 23 women with 24 cancers were enrolled, ranging in age from 32 to 76. One had ductal carcinoma in situ; there were 13 T1, 6 T2 and 4 T3 lesions. NAF was identified in 72% of breasts, more commonly in cancerous than unaffected breasts. DL was performed on 33 breasts; of these, 55% were adequate. Only 16.6% of samples from malignant breasts contained abnormality, marked atypia in 1 and malignancy in 3. No samples from unaffected breasts demonstrated cellular abnormalities.",
        "The low sensitivity of DL performed on malignant breasts to identify abnormal cells adds to the growing body of evidence that this is not an effective tool in identifying existing breast cancer. Numbers are small, but the ability of DL to identify atypia in unaffected high-risk breasts may also be suboptimal. Future efforts should focus on molecular markers of risk and on alternate means of cell or tissue retrieval."
