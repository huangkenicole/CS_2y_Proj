        "The three genes encoding small non\u2011coding microRNA (miR)34a, MIR34b and MIR34c act as tumor\u2011suppressor genes. Their aberrant expressions regulated by DNA methylation have been frequently found in various types of cancer. In the present study, the DNA promoter methylation profiles of the MIR34 gene family were analyzed using the methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in order to clarify their association with breast and lung cancer, non\u2011cancerous or normal adjacent tissues. The methylation frequency of MIR34a was significantly higher in breast cancer (49.37%) compared with normal adjacent tissues (30.38%). The methylation frequency of MIR34b/c was 59.49 and 62.03% in breast cancer and normal adjacent tissues, respectively. MIR34a methylation showed a significant concordance with that of MIR34b/c only in breast cancer tissue. MIR34a methylation was significantly associated with cancer and the invasive ductal carcinoma type of breast cancer (P=0.015 and P=0.02, respectively). Methylation frequency of MIR34a and MIR34b/c was 48.42 and 56.84% in lung cancer, and 47.22 and 51.39% in pulmonary diseases, respectively. No significant association was observed between the methylation status of MIR34a and MIR34b/c, and the clinicopathological features of lung cancer or with those of non\u2011cancerous pulmonary diseases. Promoter methylation of MIR34a and MIR34b/c occurs frequently and concomitantly in breast and lung cancer, as well as in pulmonary diseases tissues, but not in breast normal tissues adjacent to tumor. These results of the present study emphasize the involvement of MIR34 methylation in human diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, MIR34a methylation may be a promising marker for a subtype of breast cancer."
