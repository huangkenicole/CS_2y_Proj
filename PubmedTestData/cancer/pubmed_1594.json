        "Our understanding of the epigenetic changes occurring in gastrointestinal cancers has gained tremendous advancements in recent years, and some epigenetic biomarkers are already translated into the clinics for cancer diagnostics. In parallel, pharmacoepigenetics and pharmacoepigenomics of solid tumors are relevant novel, but emerging and promising fields. Areas covered: A comprehensive review of the literature to summarize and update the emerging field of pharmacoepigenetics and pharmacoepigenomics of gastrointestinal cancers. Expert commentary: Several epigenetic modifications have been proposed to account for interindividual variations in drug response in gastrointestinal cancers. Similarly, single-agent or combined strategies with high doses of drugs that target epigenetic modifications (epi-drugs) were scarcely tolerated by the patients, and current research has moved to their combination with standard therapies to achieve chemosensitization, radiosensitization, and immune modulation of cancerous cells. In parallel, recent genome-wide technologies are revealing the pathways that are epigenetically deregulated during cancer-acquired resistance, including those targeted by non-coding RNAs. Indeed, novel, less toxic, and more specific molecules are under investigation to specifically target those pathways. The field is rapidly expanding and gathering together information coming from these investigations has the potential to lead to clinical applications in the coming new years."
