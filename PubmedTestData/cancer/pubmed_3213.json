        "Testicular cancer is responsible for one out of seven deaths among late adolescent and young adult males. It is the number one cancer killer of men in the second and third decade of life. However, the population at risk, men between the ages 15 and 35, is singularly unaware of this cancer's existence and its potential danger. A public awareness program has been designed to increase consciousness about this possibly fatal disease and to enhance early detection and cure through a program of testicular self-examination (TSE). This proposal incorporates intervention at local, State, and national levels. It contemplates an innovative campaign beginning at the local level, focusing on the target population and utilizing a collaboration between nonprofessionals and professionals. The aim is for a grass-roots beginning and continued public interest to culminate in a national campaign, similar to that of breast self-examination. The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent the loss of lives to testicular cancer through public education and through use of TSE."
