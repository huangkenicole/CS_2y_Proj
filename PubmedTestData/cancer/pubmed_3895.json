        "Accumulating evidence indicates an alarming increase in the incidence of early-onset cancers, which are diagnosed among adults under 50\u2009years of age, in the colorectum, esophagus, extrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, liver, stomach, pancreas, as well as the bone marrow (multiple myeloma), breast, head and neck, kidney, prostate, thyroid, and uterine corpus (endometrium). While the early-onset cancer studies have encompassed research on the wide variety of organs, this article focuses on research on digestive system cancers. While a minority of early-onset cancers in the digestive system are associated with cancer-predisposing high penetrance germline genetic variants, the majority of those cancers are sporadic and multifactorial. Although potential etiological roles of diets, lifestyle, environment, and the microbiome from early life to adulthood (i.e. in one's life course) have been hypothesized, exact contribution of each of these factors remains uncertain. Diets, lifestyle patterns, and environmental exposures have been shown to alter the oral and intestinal microbiome. To address the rising trend of early-onset cancers, transdisciplinary research approaches including lifecourse epidemiology and molecular pathological epidemiology frameworks, nutritional and environmental sciences, multi-omics technologies, etc. are needed. We review current evidence and discuss emerging research opportunities, which can improve our understanding of their etiologies and help us design better strategies for prevention and treatment to reduce the cancer burden in populations."
