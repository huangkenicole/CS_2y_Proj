        "Circular RNA (circRNA), a recently discovered subclass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), forms a covalently closed loop with neither a 5' cap structure nor a 3' polyadenylated tail. Generated from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) through \"backsplicing\" (a type of alternative RNA splicing), the majority of circRNAs are located in the cytoplasm and are widespread among living organisms. They are stable and conserved and exhibit spatiotemporal-specific expression. CircRNAs are known to be involved in the development and progression of multiple diseases, including cancer, by acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges and by regulating processes such as transcription and translation. The extensively aberrant expression profiles of circRNAs in multiple cancerous tissues make these molecules promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer. Here, we briefly review the characteristics, biogenesis, classification, and functions of circRNAs, with a particular focus on the role of circRNAs in various cancers."
