        "Quaternary ammonium surfactants, due to their diverse chemical structure and their biological properties, can be used in medicine as DNA carriers, disinfectants, and antimicrobial and antitumor agents. In this study, using melanoma A375, colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 and normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells, we tested the hypothesis that the quaternary ammonium surfactants 2-dodecanoyloxyethyl)trimethylammonium bromide (DMM-11), 2-dodecanoyloxypropyl)trimethylammonium bromide (DMPM-11) and 2-pentadecanoyloxymethyl)trimethylammonium bromide (DMGM-14) act selectively against cancer cells. The results showed that these compounds led to the initiation of the apoptotic process of programmed cell death, as evidenced by the ratio of the relative expression of Bax protein to Bcl-2. The encapsulation of surfactants in liposomes allowed lower concentrations to be used. Moreover, encapsulation reduced their toxicity towards non-cancerous cells. The anticancer efficiency and apoptotic effect of the liposomal formulations with surfactants (DMM-11, DMPM-11 and DMGM-14) were higher than those of surfactant-free liposomes. Therefore, quaternary ammonium surfactant-loaded liposomes show significant potential as delivery vehicles for the treatment of melanoma and colon cancers. The use of nano-formulations offers the advantage of optimizing quaternary ammonium surfactant delivery for improved anticancer therapy."
