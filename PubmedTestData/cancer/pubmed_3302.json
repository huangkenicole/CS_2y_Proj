        "This analysis examined the clinical and histopathological characteristics of white and red oral mucosal lesions and patient lifestyle behaviors to understand how the lesions changed over 19-23 years, including among patients who developed oral and pharyngeal cancer.",
        "Seventy-five individuals with red and/or white oral mucosal lesions with clinical diagnoses of smokeless tobacco lesions, leukoplakia, erythroplakia, lichen planus, ulcer, and virus-associated lesions were identified in six Veterans Affairs Medical Center Dental Clinics (VAMC) from 1996 to 2001. Biopsy results and patients'\u00a0sociodemographic, medical, and tobacco/alcohol use characteristics were obtained. Study dentists used standardized forms to capture information about the lesions. Study participants were re-examined at intervals through January 2002. In 2020, a retrospective review of VAMC and public records ascertained whether participants developed oral cancer or died.",
        "The most common red or white oral mucosal lesions among the 75 study participants were leukoplakia (36.0%), smokeless tobacco lesions (26.7%), virus-associated lesions (18.7%), and lichen planus (16.0%). Lesions in 11% of participants with leukoplakia and one-third of participants with lichen planus persisted for 5\u00a0years or more. Dysplasia was present in four participants with leukoplakia. Seventeen percent of participants developed a new white or red oral mucosal lesion. Five patients (6.1%) developed oral or pharyngeal cancer, four among participants with leukoplakia (one with prior dysplasia) and one among participants with lichen planus. Four of the cancers developed 6-20 years after enrollment, and only one was at the original lesion site.",
        "The occurrence of oral and pharyngeal cancers in some study participants with white and red oral mucosal lesions many years after enrollment reinforces the need for patients, dentists, and health care systems to have better methods to identify and assess the malignant potential of oral lesions, monitor patients over time, and intercept high-risk oral lesions before they become cancerous."
