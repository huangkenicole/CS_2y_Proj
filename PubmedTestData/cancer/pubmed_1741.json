        "This study aimed to assess the tissue content of essential and toxic metals including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) in the breast cancerous tissues compared to the non-cancerous tissue. The biopsy specimens of 63 breast cancers along with 63 adjacent healthy tissues in Kurdistan Province, Iran, were collected from 2019 to 2020 and assayed using ICP-MS (Agilent 7900). The results of the Mann-Whitney test illustrated that the concentration of Pb, Cd, As, Cr, Cu, and Se were significantly elevated in cancerous tissue (p < 0.05), while Zn was the only trace element with higher levels in healthy subjects (p < 0.05). Moreover, weak to moderate correlations between elements were observed in the cancerous group including Al-Cr (r=0.60), As-Cu (r=0.52), and Cu-Se (r=0.56). In contrast, no correlation over 0.50 was found between trace elements in the non-cancerous group. Raw risk differences (RDs) accounted for a significant effect for Pb, Cd, As, Ag, Cr, Se, and Zn on the development of breast cancer. In conclusion, elevated levels of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Se may contribute to enhancing the risk of breast cancer."
