        "We report detection of cervical pre-cancer through their low coherence images by applying two dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. Low coherent backscattered images of pre-cancerous cervical tissue sections were captured using a common path interferometric setup. The captured images contain both depth and lateral information of the spatial variation in refractive index (RI) occurring with progression of cervical pre-cancer. A two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (2D MFDFA) was applied on these low coherent images to study the variations occurring in their fractal nature. Long-range correlations were observed in the RI fluctuations and the strength of multifractality was found to be stronger for higher grades of cervical pre-cancer. A combination of derived multifractal parameters, namely, the generalized Hurst exponent and width of singularity spectrum showed clear differences among the different grades of pre-cancers. Normal, CIN-I and CIN-II were clearly discriminated by application of support vector machine (SVM) using radial Bessel function (RBF) kernel. The specificities and sensitivities between normal and CIN-I, CIN-I and CIN-II and normal and CIN-II were found to be 94%, 88% and 93%, 96% and 98%, 100% respectively."
