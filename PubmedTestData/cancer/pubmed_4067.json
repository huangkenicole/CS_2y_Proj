        "In the late 1800s, the concept of iatrogenic implantation of cancer cells during surgery was put forth. The most dramatic example is a recurrence in a donor graft site, which is often distant to the primary site of excision. This eliminates the possibility of incomplete removal as the etiology of recurrence. However, in addition to direct transplantation to the graft site via gloves or instruments, several other possibilities exist, including <i>de novo</i> lesions of squamous cell carcinoma in the graft, as well as systemic metastases. This article reviews 15 published case reports of cancer recurrence in graft donor sites in which the authors considered seeding via gloves or instruments. Viewing these cases in the context of a 2018 study demonstrates the varying opinions of surgeons on the possibility of cancer seeding. This article strongly advises the changing of gloves and instruments following resection of any suspicious or established cancerous tumors."
