        "BACKGROUND Breast cancer is one of the most common female cancers in the world. As a key integrator of cell signaling pathways, IQGAP1 contributes to the development and progression of several cancers. However, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of IQGAP1 in breast cancer progression remain poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study, IQGAP1 expression was measured in 96 paired breast cancer samples and the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To further explore the biological function of IQGAP1 in breast cancer cells, we knocked down IQGAP1 expression in MCF-7 cells and overexpressed it in SK-BR-3 cells. RESULTS IQGAP1 was specifically upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, IQGAP1 expression was positively correlated with breast cancer survival rate. IQGAP1 also promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and suppressed apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our results suggest that IQGAP1 plays an important role in the cell proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells, thus indicating that IQGAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast cancer."
