        "<b>Introduction</b>: Metastatic cancers are extremely difficult to treat, and account for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. The dissemination of tumor cells to distant sites is highly dynamic, asynchronous, and involves both tumor and host intrinsic factors. Effective therapeutic targets to block metastasis will need to disrupt key pathways that are required for multiple stages of metastasis.<b>Areas covered</b>: This review discusses the heterogeneity of cancers and metastasis, with an emphasis on motility as a key driver trait of metastasis. Recent metastatic cancer studies that identified either host or cancer cell intrinsic factors important for metastasis, using single gene-deficient animal models or 3D intravital imaging of avian embryo models, are also discussed. Potential metastatic blocking targets are listed as they relate to metastatic cancer therapy.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The development of metastatic disease is a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors from the host and cancer cells acting in a patient-specific manner. Inhibiting key driver traits of metastasis should yield survival benefit at any stage of the disease, and we look forward to the next generation of personalized medicines for cancer therapy that target cancer cell motility for increased therapeutic efficacy."
