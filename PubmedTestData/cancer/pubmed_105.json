        "Where does cancer come from? Although the cell-of-origin is difficult to pinpoint, cancer clones harbor information about their clonal ancestries. In an effort to find cells before they evolve into a life-threatening cancer, physicians currently diagnose premalignant diseases at frequencies that substantially exceed those of clinical cancers. Cancer risk prediction relies on our ability to distinguish between which premalignant features will lead to cancer mortality and which are characteristic of inconsequential disease. Here, we review the evolution of cancer from premalignant disease, and discuss the concept that even phenotypically normal cell progenies inherently gain more malignant potential with age. We describe the hurdles of prognosticating cancer risk in premalignant disease by making reference to the underlying continuous and multivariate natures of genotypes and phenotypes and the particular challenge inherent in defining a cell lineage as \"cancerized.\""
