        "Nanotheranostics is fast-growing pharmaceutical technology for simultaneously monitoring drug release and its distribution, and to evaluate the real time therapeutic efficacy through a single nanoscale for treatment and diagnosis of deadly disease such as cancers. In recent two decades, biodegradable polymers have been discovered as important carriers to accommodate therapeutic and medical imaging agents to facilitate construction of multi-modal formulations. In this review, we summarize various multifunctional polymeric nano-sized formulations such as polymer-based super paramagnetic nanoparticles, ultrasound-triggered polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles bearing radionuclides, and fluorescent polymeric nano-sized formulations for purpose of theranostics. The use of such multi-modal nano-sized formulations for near future clinical trials can assist clinicians to predict therapeutic properties (for instance, depending upon the quantity of drug accumulated at the cancerous site) and observed the progress of tumor growth in patients, thus improving tailored medicines."
