        "To investigate the clinical effects of argon plasma coagulation combined high frequency electric knife in treating patients with colorectal polyp canceration.",
        "56 patients diagnosed with colorectal polyp canceration were divided into control group (n=23) and observation group (n=33). Patients in the control group were treated with high frequency electric band ligation electroexcision while patients in observation group were treated with argon coagulation combined high frequency electric knife therapy. The patients were followed up for 6 months and, then, compared for their clinical effects and prognosis.",
        "The average diameter of the polyp, the ratios of sessile and flat polyps in observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group with p<0.05. While the differences in the ratio of adenomatous polyp, middle and high differentiated as well as leafless polyps between the two groups had no statistical significance with p>0.05. Further, the differences in operation completion rate and polyp resection rate at one time in observation group was significantly higher than those of control group while operative complication rate and operation time was significantly lower than those in the control group with p<0.05. Also, the differences in recurrence in situ and recurrence time did not differ significantly between the two groups.",
