      "AbstractText": [
        "In 352 patients affected with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) the authors simultaneously detected a solid second tumour 22 times (= 6.22%) (6 cancers of the prostrate, 5 cancers of the skin, 4 cancers of the uterus, 2 cancers of the stomach, 2 cancers of the lung, one case of rectal and mamma cancer each and one case of eye sarcoma). In one third of the cases the two malignomas were simultaneously detected, thus it was excluded that the second tumour was induced by the antimitotic treatment of the primary disease. In seven cases the solid tumour was identified after diagnosing CLL, without any cytostatic therapy having been made here before. In addition, a report is given on a patient showing symptoms of gastric cancer not radically removed and a lymphocytic reaction. Initially, the case was explained as gastric adenocancer with simultaneous CLL because even 5 years after surgical treatment there were 16-20 X 10(6)/l of leukocytes with 64% of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and 85% of lympho-reticular cells in the bone marrow. Two years later, however, the blood picture was normal and remained to be unchanged further on. Thus, it seems that the healing of the gastric cancer has caused the lymphocytic reaction to have ceased. In addition, it should be noted that in 1974 the patient suffered from an epithelium after a scratch-mark on the nose tip, which was irradiated, however, without eliciting any lymphocytic reaction. The patient is still alive (June 1985)."
