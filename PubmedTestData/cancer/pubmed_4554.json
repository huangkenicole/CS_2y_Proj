        "Overexpression of Frizzled-7 (FZD7) has been associated with tumor invasion and distant metastases, but little is known about the relationship between FZD7 expression and prognosis in colon cancer.",
        "A total of 114 patients with colon cancer between June 2010 and December 2010 were enrolled in this study. The expression of FZD7 in cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the association between FZD7 expression and patient's clinicopathological characteristics was explored. The correlation between FZD7 expression and prognosis of colon cancer patients was analyzed using the Oncomine database and R2.",
        "FZD7 expression levels were significantly higher in colon cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.001). High expression of FZD7 was significantly associated with metastatic or recurrent disease in colon cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.010). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that colon cancer patients with high expression of FZD7 had a significantly poorer OS (P\u2009=\u20090.013) and DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.010). Cox regression demonstrated that the expression of FZD7 was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR\u2009=\u20096.647, P\u2009=\u20090.023). A meta-analysis from the Oncomine database demonstrated that FZD7 mRNA levels were significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal colorectal tissues, and FZD7 high expression was associated with a significantly poorer event and relapse-free survival time by analyzing the data from the R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform.",
        "Overexpression of FZD7 was associated with poor survival in patients with colon cancer. Our data suggest that FZD7 expression could be an effective prognostic biomarker for colon cancer."
