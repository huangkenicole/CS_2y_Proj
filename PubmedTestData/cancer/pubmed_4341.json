        "The disease management (DM) model for the treatment of chronic conditions has been around for many years and has been found to be effective for diseases of high prevalence and high cost (eg, diabetes, asthma, heart disease). With an increasing number of people living with cancer and the continual escalation of treatment costs, DM vendors have begun to implement DM concepts into cancer care. However, the multitude of cancer types, treatment options, and adverse effects have all presented barriers to oncology DM, and data reflecting the effectiveness of oncology DM have remained scarce. Oncology costs, the lack of congruence between provider and patient expectations of treatment, the lack of prevention and early detection for many cancers, and, most importantly, the inability of people to adhere to healthy lifestyles are additional obstacles that must be overcome. Moreover, when designing an oncology DM program, it is imperative to look at cancers individually as the etiology, treatment, and impact of cancer can be markedly different from one patient to the next. An effective oncology DM program is one that acts to decrease fatigue, reduces nosocomial infections, deals with dehydration and pain, manages anemia, identifies and treats skin infections, recognizes and treats depression and other psychological distress, provides patients access to palliative care services, facilitates informed decision making and end-of-life transitions, and promotes communication between patients and their providers as well as between physicians. Moving forward, DM vendors and health insurance companies capable of incorporating DM with medical management will be in the best position to provide optimal cancer care."
