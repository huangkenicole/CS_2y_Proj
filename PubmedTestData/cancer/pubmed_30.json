        "Cancer is underlined by genetic changes. In an unprecedented international effort, the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sequenced the tumors of over two thousand five hundred patients across 38 different cancer types, as well as the\u00a0corresponding healthy tissue, with the aim of identifying genome-wide mutations exclusively found in cancer and uncovering new genetic changes that drive tumor formation. What set this project apart from earlier efforts is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) that enabled to explore alterations beyond the\u00a0coding DNA, into cancer's non-coding genome. WGS of the entire cohort allowed to tease apart driving mutations that initiate and support carcinogenesis from passenger mutations that do not play an overt role in the disease. At least one causative mutation was found in 95% of all cancers, with many tumors showing an average of 5 driver mutations. The\u00a0PCAWG Project also assessed the transcriptional output altered in cancer and rebuilt the evolutionary history of each tumor showing that initial driver mutations can\u00a0occur years if not decades prior to a diagnosis. Here, I provide a concise review of the\u00a0Pan-Cancer Project papers published on February 2020, along with key computational tools and the\u00a0digital framework generated as part of the project. This represents an historic effort by hundreds of international collaborators, which provides a comprehensive understanding of cancer genetics, with publicly available data and resources representing a treasure trove of information to advance cancer research for years to come."
