        "Anticancer drugs for double cancers are selected based on their therapeutic effects on the target cancer, but there are insufficient data on the effects of anticancer drugs on comorbid cancer. We investigated the effect of chemotherapy on comorbid cancer in patients with simultaneous double cancers.",
        "The subjects of this retrospective study were 51 patients with simultaneous double cancers at the time of receiving systemic chemotherapy. We evaluated the types of anticancer drugs used for double cancers, the therapeutic effects on targeted and comorbid cancers, and prognoses.",
        "Disease control was achieved for 90.9% of the target cancers and 90.7% of the comorbid cancers. The prognosis was significantly better when the disease was controlled, not only in the target cancer but also in the comorbid cancer.",
        "Physicians treating double cancers should develop treatment strategies focusing not only on the treatment for advanced cancer, but also on the course of comorbidities and the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs. This study is important because it presents new possibilities to expand the indications for anticancer drugs, while allowing unnecessary clinical research to be avoided."
