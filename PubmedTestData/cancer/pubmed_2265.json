        "Although many genes and miRNAs have been reported for various cancers, pancreatic cancer's specific genes or miRNAs have not been studied precisely yet. Therefore, we have analyzed the gene and miRNA expression profile of pancreatic cancer data in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. The microarray-derived miRNAs and mRNAs were annotated by gene ontology (GO) and signaling pathway analysis. We also recognized mRNAs that were targeted by miRNA through the mirDIP database. An integrated analysis of the microarray revealed that only 6 out of 43 common miRNAs had significant differences in their expression profiles between the tumor and normal groups (P value\u2009<\u20090.05 and |log Fold Changes (logFC)|>\u20091). The hsa-miR-210 had upregulation, whereas hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-216a, hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-216b and hsa-miR-634 had downregulation in pancreatic cancer (PC). The analysis results also revealed 109 common mRNAs by microarray and mirDIP 4.1 databases. Pathway analysis showed that amoebiasis, axon guidance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, absorption and focal adhesion, adherens junction, platelet activation, protein digestion, human papillomavirus infection, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and riboflavin metabolism played important roles in pancreatic cancer. GO analysis revealed the significant enrichment in the three terms of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, which were identified as the most important processes associated strongly with pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, DTL, CDH11, COL5A1, ITGA2, KIF14, SMC4, VCAN, hsa-mir-210, hsa-mir-217, hsa-mir-216a, hsa-mir-216b, hsa-mir-375 and hsa-mir-634 can be reported as the novel diagnostic or even therapeutic markers for the future studies. Also, the hsa-mir-107 and hsa-mir-125a-5p with COL5A1, CDH11 and TGFBR1 genes can be introduced as major miRNA and genes on the miRNA-drug-mRNA network. The new regulatory network created in our study could give a deeper knowledge of the pancreatic cancer."
