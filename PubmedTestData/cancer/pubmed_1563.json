        "The autophagy pathway is used by eukaryotic cells to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Autophagy has two functions in cancerous cells which could inhibit tumorigenesis or lead to cancer progression by increasing cell survival and proliferation.",
        "In this review article, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, \u00a0and Google Scholar were searched and summarized published studies to explore the relationship between DAPK1 and mTORC1 signaling association on autophagy in cancer. Autophagy is managed through various proteins including the mTOR, which is two separated structural and functional complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2. MTORC1 is an important component of the regulatory pathway affecting numerous cellular functions including proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival. This protein plays a key role in human cancers. The activity level of mTORC1 is regulated by the death-associated protein kinases (DAPks) family, especially DAPK1. In many cancers, DAPK1 acts as a tumor suppressor which can be attributed to its ability to suppress cellular transformation and to inhibit metastasis.",
        "A deep investigation not only will reveal more about the function of DAPK1 but also might provide insights into novel therapies aimed to modulate the autophagy pathway in cancer and to achieve better cancer therapy."
