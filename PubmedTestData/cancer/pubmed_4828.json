        "This study renewed the estimation of disability weights for cancers in Korea, reflecting the nation's economic and medical-technological development during the past 10 yr. Thirty-two medical doctors evaluated disability weights for 24 major cancers based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) method. To check the intra-rater reliability, a correlation was calculated between 2011 and 2012 medians. To assess the inter-rater reliability, a correlation was estimated between oncologist and non-oncologist medians. To assess the inter-method reliability, a correlation was calculated between medians on VAS and Person-Trade-Off approaches. Moreover, findings in this study were compared to those in 2003 research. Spearman correlation was used and the 1% significance level was applied. Disability weights were relatively high for pancreas cancer (0.90), gallbladder cancer (0.81), mouth and oropharynx cancer (0.80), and esophagus cancer (0.80). Conversely, they were relatively low for breast cancer (0.37), prostate cancer (0.33) and thyroid cancer (0.10). All the inter-rater reliabilities were higher than 0.7. Indeed, the intra-rater and inter-method reliabilities were 0.752 and 0.927, respectively. Above all, disability weights for major cancers went down in Korea during 2003-2012, reflecting the progress of medical technology and the growth of cancer survival."
