        "Down-regulation of E-cadherin function is characteristic of cancer cells and might involve the small G-protein Rho family, including Rac1 and Cdc42. IQGAP1 has been reported to be one of the target proteins of Rac1 and Cdc42. To elucidate the role of IQGAP1 in cancer-cell adhesion, its expression was investigated in 47 cases of human gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry and Western blot upon protein fractionation, especially in comparison with E-cadherin and catenin expression. In the non-cancerous columnar epithelium of the stomach, IQGAP1, as well as E-cadherin/catenin, was expressed at the cell-cell boundary. IQGAP1 was frequently observed diffusely in the cytoplasm in intestinal-type tumors (20/22 cases) but was expressed at the cell membrane in diffuse-type tumors (19/25 cases), thus showing significant association with tumor differentiation (p < 0.01). Interestingly, membranous expression of IQGAP1 was inversely correlated with that of E-cadherin (p < 0.05) or alpha-catenin (p < 0.001). These observations were consistent with the Western blot results following protein fractionation. IQGAP1 was dominantly expressed in the soluble fraction in differentiated tumors; however, in undifferentiated tumors, it was mostly in the insoluble fraction. In contrast, both E-cadherin and alpha-catenin were detected only in the insoluble fraction. Thus, subcellular localization of IQGAP1 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane was correlated with E-cadherin dysfunction and tumor dedifferentiation in gastric carcinogenesis."
