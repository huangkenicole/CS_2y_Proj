        "Radionuclide imaging and therapy are promising methods for controlling systemic cancers; however, their clinical application has been limited by excessive radionuclide accumulation in healthy tissues. To minimize radionuclide accumulation in non-cancerous tissues while ensuring sufficient build up in tumors, we aimed to develop a method that controlled the in vivo dynamics of radionuclides post-administration. To this end, we describe a novel strategy that combines liposomes, a potent carrier system for drug delivery, with unique radionuclide-ligand complexes based on <sup>111</sup>In-ethylenedicysteine. Conventional <sup>111</sup>In-ligand-complexes-carrying liposomes delivered substantial amounts of radionuclides to tumors; however, they also accumulated in the liver and spleen. In contrast, <sup>111</sup>In-ethylenedicysteine-carrying liposomes greatly reduced non-specific accumulation, while being retained selectively at high doses within tumors. Liposomes were rapidly broken down in the liver, releasing encapsulated <sup>111</sup>In-ligand complexes. Among the chelates used, only <sup>111</sup>In-ethylenedicysteine could escape from the liver and be excreted in the urine. Instead, most liposomes remained intact in tumors, retaining the radionuclide-ligand complexes within them. Therefore, high tumor accumulation was obtained regardless of the type of <sup>111</sup>In-ligand complexes in the liposomes. In vivo single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging with <sup>111</sup>In-ethylenedicysteine-carrying liposomes accurately revealed tumor-selective radionuclide retention with little background. Hence, our new strategy could greatly enhance tumor-to-healthy tissue ratios, improve diagnostic imaging, boost therapeutic efficacy, reduce toxicity to healthy tissues, and facilitate radionuclide imaging and therapy."
