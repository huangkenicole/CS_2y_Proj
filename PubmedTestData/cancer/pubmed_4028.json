        "We researched the origin and progression of anaplastic pancreatic cancer (APC) from the viewpoints of cell lineage, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem-like cells (CSC).",
        "Using specimens from patients with APC and differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), expression of sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9), E-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB1, Snail, N-cadherin, CD24 and CD44 was estimated using immunohistochemistry.",
        "Almost all cases were positive for SOX9 expression. APC cases were negative, but many PDAC cases were positive for the expression of E-cadherin. A much higher number of APC cases than PDAC cases were positive for the expression of other EMT related proteins and for the expression of CSC related proteins. The ductal cancerous component of APC accounted for an average of 12% of the cancerous lesion and the expression of each marker in this component was similar to that of PDAC cases.",
        "Anaplastic pancreatic cancer had pancreatic duct cell like features and might gain dedifferentiate components through EMT and the acquisition of CSC properties."
