      "AbstractText": [
        "3441 peri-ulcerous mucosal lesions around benign and malignant gastric ulcers (1479 benign gastric ulcers, 421 cancerous degeneration of benign ulcers and 1541 ulcerative carcinomas) were studied comparatively. It was found that the ulcer of cancerous degeneration of benign ulcer was small and the epithelial regeneration at the ulcer's edge and fusion of the muscularis mucosa with the muscularis propria were very common. The cancerous tissue, extending down to the submucosa, was found at the margin but not at the base of the ulcer. Lymph node metastasis was rare. Therefore, the cancerous degeneration of ulcer was most likely an early carcinoma. These findings conform well with Hauser's criteria. Chronic atrophic gastritis intestinal metaplasia (IIb and type II), moderate and severe dysplasia were more commonly observed in cancerous degeneration of ulcers than in benign peptic ulcers or ulcerative carcinoma. These results suggest that multiple biopsies should be taken from the edge of chronic ulcers."
