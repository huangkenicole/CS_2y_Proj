        "Breast cancer metastasis suppressor gene-1 (BRMS1) mRNA and protein expression are significantly decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and this is a poor prognostic indicator. Given that the BRMS1 promoter region contains a promoter-associated CpG island (CGI) that encompasses the transcriptional start site, we hypothesized that decreased BRMS1 mRNA and protein levels in NSCLC was secondary to increased BRMS1 promoter methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) of the two known CGIs (-3477 to - 2214 and - 531 to + 608) in the BRMS1 genome was performed in NSCLC cells. This demonstrated a robust increase in methylation of the promoter-associated CGI (-531 to + 608) but not of the upstream CGI (-3477 to - 2214). To experimentally verify that methylation contributes to BRMS1 transcriptional repression, we cloned the BRMS1 promoter region, including the promoter-associated CGI, into a luciferase reporter gene and found that BRMS1 promoter activity was dramatically inhibited under methylated conditions. We then assessed the BRMS1 methylation profile with MSP and bisulphite-sequencing PCR in human NSCLC adenocarcinoma (n = 20) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 20) relative to adjacent non-cancerous bronchial epithelium. There was a significant increase in BRMS1 promoter methylation in all NSCLC specimens relative to non-cancerous tissues, with the most dramatic difference in squamous cell cancer histology. Subsequent immunostaining demonstrated that nuclear BRMS1 expression is reduced in lung cancer specimens compared to normal bronchial epithelium. The association between BRMS1 promoter methylation and specific clinical and histopathological variables was examined using a general linear model. Pathological tumour stage was associated with increased BRMS1 methylation in squamous cell cancers. These observations demonstrate that methylation of the promoter-associated CGI in BRMS1 results in its transcriptional repression, and highlight the potential clinical relevance of this methylation event with respect to NSCLC tumour histology and pathological stage."
