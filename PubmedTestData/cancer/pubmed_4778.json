        "The conventional techniques in treating cancerous cells in a human body are conducted either by surgery or oral medication or injecting anticancer drugs, which may have several side effects on healthy cells. Compared to these techniques, site-specific delivery of drugs can be one of the pillars of cancer treatment. It could allow for better treatment efficiency and lesser adverse effects. A promising drug delivery approach is magnetic drug targeting, which can be realized if a drug delivery vehicle possesses an intense magnetic moment. Here, we discuss different types of magnetic nanomaterials, which can be used as magnetic drug delivery vehicles, approaches to magnetically targeted delivery, and promising strategies for the enhancement of the imaging-guided delivery and the therapeutic action. The present study aims to discuss all significant factors that influence the process of magnetic drug targeting through microvessels, such as fluidic force, magnetic force, particle-particle interaction, inertia force, Saffman lift force, and permeability of the microvessel. We consider the nature of blood flow as non-Newtonian in single-phase and two-phase models so that a realistic rheological model for an effective magnetic drug targeting can be established through proper comparison. Here we present a comprehensive mathematical model on magnetic drug targeting that could help the medical experts and biomedical engineers in applying the methodology of magnetic drug targeting effectively to cure cancerous disease."
