      "AbstractText": [
        "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer and accounts for 5% of malignant tumor deaths. Recent research suggests that chronic inflammation and DNA damage may drive the onset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, implying that lowering chronic inflammation and DNA damage compounds may provide chemo-prevention. According to epidemiological and experimental evidence, selenium is linked to a lower risk of several malignancies, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, its exact mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, we used cell lines and a 4-NQO mice model to explore the anti-cancer mechanism of four types of selenium. Our findings indicated that selenium inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, and ROS level of ESCC cell lines in a time-dependent manner. Intriguingly, selenium treatment impeded 4-NQO-induced high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and reduced the number of positive inflammatory cells by preserving DNA from oxidative damage. In addition, selenium significantly decreased the expression of Ki-67 and induced apoptosis. This study demonstrates that selenium has a significant chemo-preventive effect on ESCC by reducing high-grade dysplasia to low-grade dysplasia. For the first time, selenium was shown to slow down the progression of esophageal cancer by lowering inflammation and oxidative DNA damage."
