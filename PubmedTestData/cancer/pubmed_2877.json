      "AbstractText": [
        "Tumors of the orbit are diagnosed sporadically. Based on the tumor registry of the American Cancer Society the incidence of tumors of the orbit is assessed at fewer than 1 per 100 000 persons. Tumors of the orbit can be divided into three groups: primary tumors, tumors penetrating the orbit from neighboring structures, and tumors that are metastases of malignant cancers from distant organs.",
        "To present the results of treatment of patients with tumors of the orbit treated in the Head and Neck Surgery and Laryngological Oncology Ward of the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Pozna\u0144 during 2007-2010.",
        "The study group consisted of 26 patients surgically treated during 2007-2010 in the Head and Neck Surgery and Laryngological Oncology Ward of the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Pozna\u0144.",
        "In the postoperative histopathological examination 18 patients (69%) were diagnosed with malignant tumors, 7 patients (27%) with non-malignant tumor and 1 patient (4%) with inflammatory lesion. Among malignant tumors the most frequent was basal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in 7 patients (27%). When removing the tumors of the orbit 4 types of operation were performed: lateral orbitotomy, superior orbitotomy, eye enucleation, and exenteration of the orbit. In 3 patients (12%) cancer recurrences occurred. All patients with recurrences underwent reoperation. In a patient with an extensive recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma the surgery was not radical and the patient died during palliative chemotherapy.",
        "Patients with tumors of the orbit should be treated operatively in appropriately prepared centers. In our material the confirmation of this thesis is the group of patients with recurrences of basal cell carcinoma, operated on many times in the past, who due to the extent of the cancerous process had to have the seeing eye removed. In the case of malignant cancers of the orbit an interdisciplinary approach to the problem and the assurance of psychological care for patients who have lost an orbit are essential."
