        "Previous studies on the accuracy of 5-aminolevulinic-acid-mediated photodynamic diagnosis (5-ALA PDD) have been reported for various cancers and brain surgery. However, biliary tract cancer is rare. Therefore, 5-ALA PDD has not been fully evaluated in biliary tract cancers. Small biliary tract cancer lesions such as peritoneal dissemination, liver metastases, and lymph node metastases are negative prognosticators in patients with biliary cancer. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if 5-ALA PDD could detect small biliary tract cancer lesions in murine models of biliary cancers.",
        "Biliary cancer cell lines (TFK-1, HuCCT-1, G415, HuH28, SSP25, RBE, KKU055 and KKU100) and Normal human dermal fibroblast cells were used to evaluate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation in vitro. Subcutaneous tumor mice were established using two cell lines (TFK-1 and HuCCT-1). 5-ALA (250 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and fluorescent 5ALA-PDD was performed 3 h later to evaluate tumoral PpIX accumulation. A murine peritoneal disseminated nodule model was established by intraperitoneal injection of TFK-1 cells. Four weeks later, 5-ALA was administered intraperitoneally, and 5-ALA-PDD was performed 3 h post administration to evaluate PpIX accumulation in the disseminated nodules. The presence of tumor cells in tumors and nodules was confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin staining.",
        "Compared TO non-cancerous cell lines, PpIX accumulation was increased in biliary tract cancer cell lines. PpIX accumulation led to a strong fluorescent signal in all subcutaneous tumors. In the murine model of peritoneal dissemination, microdisseminated nodules (<1 mm) that could not be detected under white light were clearly visible using 5-ALA-PDD.",
        "5-ALA PDD was useful for diagnosis of biliary tract cancer and detection of small peritoneal metastatic lesions in murine models of biliary cancers. Clinical studies and applications of 5-ALA PDD for biliary tract cancer are expected in the future."
