        "The rationale for identifying carcinogens and their mechanisms of action is twofold. First, carcinogens must be identified so they can be eliminated from our environment. And second, mechanisms must be identified that are involved in the conversion of a normal cell to a cancer cell. This knowledge will offer more approaches to cancer prevention. The ability to prevent many common fatal cancers caused by environmental agents was recognized by an expert committee of the World Health Organization in 1964. Their report represented a consensus of expert opinion at that time. Since that report, some writers have suggested that as many as 80% to 90% of cancers are preventable. More conservative estimates range from 40% to 50%. Preventing only 40% of cancers (the most conservative estimate) would result in saving thousands of lives every year. Therefore, all members of the health care team must take an active role in cancer prevention. The nurse's role in cancer prevention is one of education of the public. As more information about carcinogens become available, nurses need to share that information so that individuals are better able to make healthy choices for themselves that will lead to a lower incidence of cancer, our ultimate goal."
