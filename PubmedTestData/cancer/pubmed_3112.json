        "Gastric scirrhous cancer was classified from the radiological findings into three phases (typical, latent and early phases) by cancerous involvement in the gastric wall. Radiological findings in the typical phase were divided into a giant-fold type and a no giant-fold type. We made a differential diagnosis for scirrhous cancer and other diseases. Radiological findings in the typical phase of scirrhous cancer were characteristic stiffness and rigidity of the gastric wall; in the latent phase, they were swelling and winding of mucosal folds in appropriate distended stomach; and in the early phase, interrupted folds around barium fleck. The effect of chemotherapy against a gastric scirrhous cancer is decided by distensibility of the gastric wall in radiological findings."
