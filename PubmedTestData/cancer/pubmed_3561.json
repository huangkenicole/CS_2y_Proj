        "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecological malignancies. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has gradually developed as a convenient, inexpensive and non-destructive technique for the study of many diseases. In this study, FTIR spectra of normal and several heterogeneous ovarian cancer cell lines as well as ovarian cancer tissue samples were compared in the spectral region of 4000\u00a0cm<sup>-\u20091</sup> - 600\u00a0cm<sup>-\u20091</sup>.",
        "Cell samples were collected from human ovarian surface epithelial cell line (HOSEpiC) and five ovarian cancer cell lines (ES2, A2780, OVCAR3, SKOV3 and IGROV1). Validation spectra were performed on normal and cancerous tissue samples from 12 ovarian cancer patients. FTIR spectra were collected from a NICOLET iN10 MX spectrometer and the spectral data were analyzed by OMNIC 8.0 software.",
        "Spectral features discriminating malignant tissues from normal tissues were integrated by cell line data and tissue data. In particular changes in cancerous tissues, the decrease in the amount of lipids and nucleic acids were observed. Protein conformation and composition were also altered in some cancer cells. The band intensity ratio of 1454/1400 was higher in normal cells/tissues and lower in cancer cells/tissues.",
        "The spectral features revealed the important molecular characteristics about ovarian cancer cells/tissues. These findings demonstrate the possible diagnostic use of FTIR spectroscopy, providing the research model and evidences, and supporting the future study on more tissue samples to establish a data bank of spectra features for the possible discrimination of ovarian cancers."
