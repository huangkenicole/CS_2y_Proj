        "Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is a valuable technique, increasingly applied in clinical and biological analysis. Light absorption properties of urine and body tissue can be obtained more easily by the PAS technique because of its high sensitivity, than by the conventional optical techniques. By observing their absorption properties it is possible to diagnose some diseases and in this study we have used PAS to assess cancerous changes in urine and tissue. Three groups were studied: normal individuals; patients with cancer; and patients with cancer and subsequent inflammation; and the characteristic light absorption peaks obtained for a certain band (240-420 nm). These results were compared with the clinical diagnosis and proved consistent and reliable for the diagnosis of urinary tract cancer subsequently confirmed by operation. This method will probably be a useful tool for the early clinical diagnosis of cancer of the urinary system."
