        "The most frequent kind of malignancy in the universe is skin cancer, which has been categorized into non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. There are no complete information of the skin carcinogenesis process. A variety of external and internal agents contribute to the non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer pathogenesis. These factors are epigenetic changes, X-rays, genetic, arsenic compounds, UV rays, and additional chemical products. It was found that there could be a relationship between the appearing novel and more suitable therapies for participants in this class of diseases and detection of basic molecular paths. A covalently closed loop structure bond connecting the 5' and 3' ends characterizes a new group of extensively expressed endogenous regulatory RNAs, which are called circular RNAs (circRNAs). Mammals commonly express circRNAs. They are of high importance in tumorigenesis. Multiple lines evidence indicated that a variety of circular RNAs are associated with initiation and development of skin-related diseases such as skin cancers. Given that different circular RNAs (hsa_circ_0025039, hsa_circRNA006612, circRNA005537, and circANRIL) via targeting various cellular and molecular targets (e.g., CDK4, DAB2IP, ZEB1, miR-889, and let-7c-3p) exert their effects on skin cancers progression. Herein, for first time, we summarized different circular RNAs in skin cancers and noncancerous diseases. Moreover, we highlighted crosstalk between circular RNAs and ceRNAs in cancerous conditions."
