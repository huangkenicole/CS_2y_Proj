        "To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with recurrent colorectal cancer.",
        "Clinicopathological characteristics and postoperative survival of 235 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer after radical resection were retrospectively analyzed, and was compared with that of 993 patients with radical resection.",
        "The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates after radical resection were 67.7% and 55.8%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year survival rates in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer was 43.9% and 28.1% (P=0.000), respectively. Among patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of the patients underwent second radical resection were 50.2% and 32.7%, while the 5- and 10-year survival rates of the patients without second surgery were 25.8% and 0, respectively (P=0.000). On univariate analysis, postoperative recurrence was associated with age at diagnosis, cancerous ileus, ascites, lymphs nodes involvement, gross types, infiltration of tumor and Duke's stage. Multivariate analysis revealed that cancerous ileus, ascites, gross types and Duke's stage were independent predictive factors for postoperative recurrence.",
        "Cancerous ileus, ascites, gross types and Duke's stage were independent predictive factors for recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer after radical resection. The 5- and 10-year survival rates and quality of life could be improved by second radical resection."
