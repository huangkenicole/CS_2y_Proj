        "Thyroid cancers have increased dramatically over the past few decades. Comorbidities may be important, and previous studies have indicated elevated second cancer risk after initial primary thyroid cancers. This study examined the risk of second cancers after development of a thyroid cancer, primary utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database.",
        "The cohort consisted of men and women diagnosed with first primary thyroid cancer who were reported to a SEER database in 1973-2008 (n=52,103). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for all secondary cancers. Confidence intervals and p-values are at 0.05 significance alpha level and are two-sided based on Poisson exact methods.",
        "In this cohort, 4457 individuals developed second cancers. The risk of developing second cancers after a primary thyroid cancer varied from 10% to 150% depending on different cancer types. Cancers in all sites, breast, skin, prostate, kidney, brain, salivary gland, second thyroid, lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia were elevated. The magnitude of the risk varied by histology, tumor size, calendar year of first primary thyroid cancer diagnosis, and the treatment of the primary thyroid cancer. The risk of a second cancer was elevated in patients whose first primary thyroid carcinomas were small, or were diagnosed after 1994, or in whom some form of radiation treatment was administered.",
        "This large population-based analysis of second cancers among thyroid cancer patients suggests that there was an increase of second cancers in all sites, and the most commonly elevated second cancers were the salivary gland and kidney. Additionally, the increase in second cancers in patients with recently diagnosed thyroid microcarcinomas (<10\u2009mm) suggests that aggressive radiation treatment of the first primary thyroid cancer, the environment, and genetic susceptibility, may increase the risk of a second cancer."
