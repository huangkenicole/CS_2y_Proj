        "Cancerous cells are abnormal cells characterized by aberrant growth and proliferation, which can involve various types of cells and tissues. Through numerous signalling pathways, many mechanisms are involved in cells that keep them normal. These signalling pathways are tightly set by different proteins whose expression is regulated by a large number of factors. In other words, when a regulating factor does not act properly or undergoes a change in its function or expression, the result will be that the subordinate gene and subsequently the related protein will show deranged expression and activity. This leads to disordered signalling pathways which bring about uncontrolled proliferation in cells. One of the most significant factors in adjusting the expression of genes is noncoding RNAs. It should be noted that all underlying causes initiating malignancy try to alter the main regulatory factors in cellular processes and gene expression and direct the cell to an unregulated state. Microorganisms have been identified as one of the important elements to direct normal cells to abnormality. That is, they probably agitate the malignant traits through manipulating significant factors such as ncRNAs in given cells using their own or host-related factors. The present study is aimed at examining how the long noncoding RNAs are involved in microorganism-mediated cancers."
