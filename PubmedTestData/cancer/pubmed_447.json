        "Patients with head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing additional primary tumours in the aerodigestive tract as a result of field cancerization phenomena. In this context, the appearance of a new neoplasm often poses a problem of differential diagnosis between recurrence and new primary tumour. The differentiation between the two entities in essentially clinical and conventionally based on the histological and spatio-temporal relations between the two lesions; however, the validity of these criteria has still to be assessed.",
        "To evaluate whether field cancerization phenomena may affect the clinical diagnosis of relapse/metastasis in the head and neck region, p53 mutation pattern was analysed in a series of primary tumours and corresponding recurrences/metastases. The rationale was that, since p53 mutations are a very early and polymorphic phenomenon, a recurrence/metastasis must retain the same mutation as the the primary tumour, whereas independent tumours are likely to display a different p53 gene status.",
        "Molecular analysis provided conclusive results in 9 of 12 cases analysed. The clinical diagnosis of recurrence was confirmed by molecular analysis in 4 of these cases. In contrast, a differential p53 mutation pattern supported an independent origin for 3 presumed local recurrences and 2 lung lesions.",
        "The use of p53 mutation analysis as a clonality marker allowed us to ascertain the inadequacy of the current diagnostic criteria for the differentiation between a new independent tumour and recurrence/metastasis. These findings substantiate the relevance of field cancerization phenomena in the head and neck region and prompt the use of p53 mutation analysis as a fundamental tool to improve the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancers."
