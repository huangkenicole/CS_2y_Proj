        "Superficially spreading carcinoma of the esophagus, consisting mainly of intraepithelial carcinoma, is not as rare as was previously thought. Despite the surgical significance of this entity, no general definition has been established, and the clinical features of this disease remain to be clarified.",
        "A total of 54 patients with superficial carcinoma of the esophagus (defined as carcinoma limited to the epithelium or superficially invading the lamina propria or submucosa) were classified into two groups according to the longitudinal extent of the lesion. A total of 13 patients with superficially spreading carcinoma (defined as a superficial carcinoma measuring >5 cm and consisting mainly of intraepithelial carcinoma) were compared to 41 patients with nonspreading esophageal carcinoma.",
        "One patient with superficially spreading carcinoma had a positive resection margin because of multiple cancerous lesions. The only significant difference in the clinical and pathological features of the two groups was a higher prevalence of associated multiple cancerous lesions in patients with the superficially spreading type.",
        "Superficially spreading carcinoma of the esophagus is often associated with multiple cancerous lesions. For endoscopists and esophageal surgeons, it is important to define the proximal extent of intraepithelial cancer and the presence of multiple cancerous lesions to perform curative resection."
