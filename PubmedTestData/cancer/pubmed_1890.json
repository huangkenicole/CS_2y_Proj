        "Multiple sections of 40 consecutive cases with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, all of which bad wide intraductal cancerous extension, were examined by immunohistochemical analysis for evaluation of hormone dependency in several areas of breast cancer tissues. In this study, we examined the expression of pS2 protein in the central invasive area (CIV), central intraductal cancerous area (CDC) and forefront intraductal cancerous area (FDC). pS2 staining was positive in 52.5% (21/40) of CIV and a significant correlation was found between pS2 expression in CIV and the estrogen receptor status (ER). pS2 staining was positive in 77.5% of CDC and 85.0% of FDC, respectively. A majority (68.4%) of the cases that were negative pS2 in CIV were positive for pS2 in FDC. Moreover, the cases with noncomedo intraductal carcinoma in premenopausal status showed a higher positivity of pS2 expression in FDC than the cases with comedo-carcinoma, though the number of cases of comedo-carcinoma was limited. These findings suggest that endocrine therapy may be useful after breast conserving treatment regardless of the ER status of the primary tumor."
