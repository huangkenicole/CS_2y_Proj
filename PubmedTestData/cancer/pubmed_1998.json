        "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the deadliest human malignancies. Early detection is difficult and effective treatment is limited. Verifying the presence of micrometastatic dissemination and vessel invasion remains elusive, limiting radiological staging once this diagnosis is made. Diagnostic imaging provides independent tools to evaluate and characterize the biologic behavior of pancreatic cancer. Conventional anatomic imaging alone with either CT or MRI yields useful information on organ involvement but is limited in providing molecular and physiological information. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET or MRS provide information on metabolic and signaling pathways. Advanced MR sequences that target physiological parameters expand imaging options to characterize these tumors. By considering the parametric data from these three imaging approaches (anatomic, molecular, and physiological) we can better define specific tumor signatures. Such parametric characterization can provide insight into tumor metabolism, cellular density, protein expression, focal perfusion, and vascular permeability of these tumors. Radiogenomics research has already demonstrated ability to obtain information about cancer's genotype and phenotype; this is without invasive procedures or surgery. Further advances in these areas of experimental imaging hold promise to enable future clinical advances in detection and therapy of pancreatic cancer."
