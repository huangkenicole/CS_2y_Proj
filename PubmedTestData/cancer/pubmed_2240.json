        "A purpose of mucosal random biopsy of urinary bladder is to get informations about the extent of cancerous lesion and the existence of rest of cancer. For the purpose of determining the care range of the operation and postoperative treatments by getting these informations during the operation, we drew up stamp cytological preparations for mucosal random biopsy of urinary bladder performed during TUR-Bt, and examined potency of application of this method to quick diagnostics. First of all, 15 times of transurethral resections of bladder cancers were performed on 14 cases, and 19 of imprint preparations were made from the excised tumor materials during operation. Then the accuracy rate of the rapid cytology was evaluated based on permanent preparations that were made simultaneously. The accuracy rate of the intraoperative rapid cytology was 84.2%. Next, a similar procedure was performed on 68 materials of random biopsy during the above-mentioned operation. The accuracy rate of imprint cytology was 73.5%. The relatively low accuracy rate of rapid cytology must be attributed to diagnostic difficulty noted when dealing with Papanicoloau class 3. For all above, it was suggested that rapid implant cytology during operation must be applicable to quick diagnostics."
