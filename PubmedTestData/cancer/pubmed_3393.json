        "Thyroid cancer holds the first place of the malignant tumors of the endocrine system. One of the less common thyroid cancers is follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), which is very difficult to diagnose because it gives the same image as adenoma, which is benign. Certainty of the diagnosis is gained only when FTC gives metastases. Therefore, it was decided to compare normal and neoplastic (FTC) thyroid tissues with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The obtained FTIR spectra and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed us to conclude that there are differences in the FTIR spectrum between normal tissues and those affected by cancer. In addition, the results indicate that there is a decrease in the number of functional groups that build cellular and tissue structures in tumoral tissues. The shifts of wave numbers corresponding to the protein and lipid function group vibrations, as well as the calculated second derivative of the FTIR spectra showed the structural changes in neoplastic tissues. Moreover, the deconvolution of the amide I massif indicates that in cancerous tissues the prevailing secondary structure is \u03b2-sheet structure, while in normal tissues it is \u03b1-helix. The obtained results allow us to conclude that infrared spectroscopy, in addition to providing information on the composition of tested samples, can be an excellent diagnostic tool contributing to understanding the FTC substrate."
