        "The absence of early diagnosis contributes to oesophageal cancer being the sixth most common cause of global cancer-associated deaths, with a 5-year survival rate of\u2009<\u200920%. Barrett's oesophagus is the main pre-cancerous condition to adenocarcinoma development, characterised by the morphological transition of oesophageal squamous epithelium to metaplastic columnar epithelium. Early tracking and treatment of oesophageal adenocarcinoma could dramatically improve with diagnosis and monitoring of patients with Barrett's Oesophagus. Current diagnostic methods involve invasive techniques such as endoscopies and, with only a few identified biomarkers of disease progression, the detection of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is costly and challenging. In this work, single-cell Raman spectroscopy was combined with microfluidic techniques to characterise the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma through the progression of healthy epithelial, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were used to classify the different stages of cancer progression. with the ability to differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells with an accuracy of 97%. Whilst the approach could also separate the dysplastic stages from healthy or cancer with high accuracy-the intra-class separation was approximately 68%. Overall, these results highlight the potential for rapid and reliable diagnostic/prognostic screening of Barrett's Oesophagus patients."
