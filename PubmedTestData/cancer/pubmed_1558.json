        "Head and neck cancer survivors have increased risk of developing second primary tumors compared to overall population. Because second primary represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, early detection is fundamental.",
        "In this 10-year single-institution study, we investigated the following: incidence, clinical-pathological risk factors, and survival of patients with second primary tumor. We included all patients with diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck seen at the Modena University Hospital from 2008 to 2018.",
        "Among 1,177 patients included, 222 (18.9%) developed second primary tumor; its survival probability at 5\u00a0years was 40.6%. Alcohol consumption (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0055) and index cancer in oropharynx (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0029), supraglottic larynx (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0000), glottic larynx (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0222) were associated with higher risk of second primary. The most common second primary sites were head and neck district and lung (70, 31.5%, and 67, 30.2%, respectively). Head and neck district were more common in oral cavity (18, 43%) and oropharynx index cancer (20, 31%); lung second primary in hypopharynx (4, 40%), supraglottic larynx (17, 43%), and glottic larynx index cancer (23, 35%).",
