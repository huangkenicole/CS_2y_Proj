      "AbstractText": [
        "Use of lenvatinib, which has a high response rate in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, sometimes results in tumor shrinkage and resectability of previously unresectable liver cancers. In Asia, including Japan, liver reserve, one of the determinants of resectability, is mainly determined by the indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate. Three patients with advanced liver cancer treated at our institution had very poor ICG retention rates during treatment with lenvatinib. Lenvatinib may reduce blood flow in both cancerous and non-cancerous regions by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor. Therefore, accurate determination of liver function likely requires withdrawal of this treatment several days before ICG retention testing."
