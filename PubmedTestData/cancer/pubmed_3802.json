        "Despite the recent progress in cancer management approaches, the mortality rate of cancer is still growing and there are lots of challenges in the clinics in terms of novel therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are regulatory small noncoding RNAs and are already confirmed to have a great role in regulating gene expression level by targeting multiple molecules that affect cell physiology and disease development. Recently, miRNAs have been introduced as promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Regulatory potential of tumor suppressor miRNAs, which enables regulation of entire signaling networks within the cells, makes them an interesting option for developing cancer therapeutics. In this regard, over recent decades, scientists have aimed at developing powerful and safe targeting approaches to restore these suppressive miRNAs in cancerous cells. The present review summarizes the function of miRNAs in tumor development and presents recent findings on how miRNAs have served as therapeutic agents against cancer, with a special focus on tumor suppressor miRNAs (mimics). Moreover, the latest investigations on the therapeutic strategies of miRNA delivery have been presented."
