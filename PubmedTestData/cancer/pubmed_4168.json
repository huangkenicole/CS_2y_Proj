        "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant syndrome predisposing affected individuals to gastrointestinal (GI) cancers through a high burden of polyposis. Colorectal cancer rates reach 100% by the age of 45, making early colectomy a mainstay of treatment. While most patients undergo colectomy at an early age, ongoing screening and surveillance of the upper gastrointestinal tract and rectal pouch must continue throughout adulthood. Endoscopic therapy of gastric, duodenal, ampullary and rectal pouch polyps is critical to reduce morbidity and cancer related mortality. Management of these lesions is not uniform, and is dependent on their location, size, histology, and risk of malignant potential. Medical therapies targeting pathways that reduce the malignant progression of pre-cancerous lesions have been studied for many years. While studies on the use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) in chemoprevention have shown encouraging results in Lynch syndrome and primary colorectal cancer, the potential benefits of these medications have not been duplicated in FAP cohorts. While data remains limited on chemoprevention in FAP, a number of randomized trials are currently underway examining targeted therapies with the potential to slow the progression of the disease. This review aims to provide an in-depth review of the literature on current endoscopic options and chemopreventive therapies targeting FAP. While the endoscopic management has robust data for its use, chemoprevention in FAP is still in its infancy. The complementary use of chemopreventive agents and endoscopic therapy for FAP patients is quickly becoming a growing and exciting area of research."
