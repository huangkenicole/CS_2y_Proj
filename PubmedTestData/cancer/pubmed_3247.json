        "To clarify the significance of E-cadherin gene alterations in the development of diffuse-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, we analyzed mutations of the E-cadherin gene using the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method followed by direct sequencing. Twenty-two signet ring cell carcinomas of the stomach (10 intramucosal and 12 advanced cancers) were examined. Genomic DNA was extracted separately from cancerous and non-cancerous tissues and PCR-SSCP analysis was performed on exons 5 to 9 and the adjacent 30- to 40-base-pair intron sequences of the E-cadherin gene. Mobility shifts were found in 2 of the 10 intramucosal cancers. In 2 of the 12 advanced cancers, abnormalities of the E-cadherin gene were observed in intramucosal lesions as well as in deeply invaded areas. These results indicated that E-cadherin gene mutations are an early event in the development of signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach. Direct sequencing revealed that the locations of mutations of the E-cadherin gene included the branch point sequence in the intron which is responsible for RNA splicing. Reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated aberrant RNA splicing in a case with a branch point mutation, suggesting that branch point mutations play an important role in functional modifications of E-cadherin in signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach."
