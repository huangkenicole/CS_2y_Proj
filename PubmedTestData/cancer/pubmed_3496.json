        "Minimally invasive surgery decreases postoperative morbidity after radical hysterectomy (RH) for early-stage cervical cancer. However, a randomized trial and large retrospective data question its safety after observing lower rates of survival than open surgery [1,2]. The causes of this higher recurrence rate are not definitely established but may result from cancer exposure to the peritoneum during vaginal section and cancerous cells' spillage enhanced by pneumoperitoneum or a uterine manipulator. The aim of this surgical video was to present a standardized step-by-step approach for robotic RH according to the recent recommendations from the ARCAGY -Group of National Investigators for the Study of Ovarian and Breast Cancers surgeon's group [3].",

        "A 48-year-old woman was diagnosed with a stage IB2 endocervical adenocarcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2018) with a tumor size of 27 mm. Surgery was planned after preoperative pulsed dose rate uterovaginal brachytherapy. Surgery was performed following 10 reproducible steps: \u2022 Pelvic sentinel node identification according to the SENTICOL-III trial \u2022 Right infundibulopelvic and round ligaments transection \u2022 Right uterine vessels transection \u2022 Parametrectomy \u2022 Right uterosacral ligament transection \u2022 Bladder mobilization \u2022 Identical left dissection \u2022 Rectovaginal space development \u2022 Colpectomy by vaginal route after complete pneumoperitoneum exsufflation \u2022 Robotic vaginal cuff closure and pelvic inspection Thorough robotically assisted vaginal cuff closure was carried out as a comparative study suggesting that abdominal closure may decrease vaginal complications and dehiscence [3].",
        "No international recommendations for the RH approach have yet been endorsed. Patients must be clearly informed about the benefit-risk ratio of the surgical route. If a minimally invasive RH is still decided, the patient should be referred to experienced centers, and precautionary measures must be implemented [4]. Colpotomy by vaginal route without pneumoperitoneum is recommended. Uterine manipulators have to be strictly avoided. Preoperative brachytherapy has been reported in experienced centers in France with favorable histologic response with high rates of pathologic complete response (near 70%) and seems particularly worthwhile for tumor sizes ranging from 2 to 4 cm or presenting with lymphovascular invasion [5]."
