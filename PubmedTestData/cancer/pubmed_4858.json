        "Although an immense effort has been made to develop novel diagnostic methods and treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the survival rate of this disease has remained virtually unchanged. Small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) have appeared to be very promising biomarkers of cancer including NSCLC.",
        "We investigated the expression level of six miRNAs, and subsequently we evaluated their diagnostic ability and their clinical significance.",
        "We performed an analysis in 50 paired cancer and non-cancerous lung tissue samples collected from NSCLC patients. The RT-qPCR technique was used to investigate the expression profile.",
        "Obtained results indicate that miR-30a-5p, miR-126-3p and miR-486-5p are downregulated, while miR-205-5p and miR-210-3p are upregulated in NSCLC tissue. Moreover, performed stepwise discriminant analysis determined the model including miR-30a-5p and miR-210-3p which tested on the test set (n= 30) revealed an AUC of 0.969 and provided 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity in discriminating NSCLC tissue from non-cancerous lung tissue.",
        "The present preliminary study demonstrated that five tested miRNAs were deregulated in cancer tissue. Moreover, miR-30a-5p together with miR-210-3p with excellent sensitivity and acceptable specificity may distinguish cancer tissue form non-cancerous tissue and thus may become a potential diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC."
