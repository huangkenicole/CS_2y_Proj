        "LncRNAs belong to the type of noncoding RNA transcripts, which exceed 200 nucleotides in size. MALAT1 as one of the earlier identified lncRNAs in cancer is investigated by more and more scientific researchers. Expression, clinical significance and function of MALAT1 in pan-cancer exist as big difference. To detect the expression and clinical significance of MALAT1 gene precisely and comprehensively among different kinds of cancers, some classical databases such as GEPIA, TIMER, KM Plotter, and PrognoScan were fully applied. An immunological role of MALAT1 among different kinds of cancers was also determined in TIMER database. Our results showed that MALAT1 was differently expressed in different kinds of cancers using GEPIA, Oncomine, and TIMER databases to analyze. Especially, MALAT1 high RNA level was related to the early stage in lung and gastric cancer patients. MALAT1 expression was closely related to prognosis among different cancer patients. Furthermore, expression of MALAT1 was related to tumor immune cell infiltrating. Expression level of MALAT1 was also related to immune makers such as macrophage, T cell, NK cells, and so on. These findings indicate that MALAT1 could be a potential prognostic biomarker of some kinds of cancer and was significantly correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in a wide variety of cancers."
