        "An estimated 4% of all cancers are of the oral cavity or oropharyngeal. Presently, management of the oral cancers mainly includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy either alone or in combination depending on the individual case. Each of these techniques has their advantages and disadvantages. Surgery demands removal of cancerous tissue causing disfigurement and functional impairment. Radiotherapy has significant side effects like mucositis, myelosuppression, xerostomia and dental caries. With the advent of newer treatment methods like the targeted therapy, immune therapy and gene therapy, treatment outcomes are better with fewer side effects. This has generally improved survival rates and quality of life of cancer patients."
