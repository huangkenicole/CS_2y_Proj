      "AbstractText": [
        "Multimorbidity is associated with a high mortality rate and low health-related quality of life. Previous studies have indicated that multimorbidity tends to be associated with not receiving cancer screening, although this association remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations between multimorbidity and the delivery of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in Japan, and to identify subgroups that did not receive cancer screening.",
        "This study used cross-sectional data from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, which used a stratified random sample of the general Japanese population. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between the number of chronic conditions and each cancer's screening proportion. The relevant covariates included age, marital status, education level, occupation, and household income.",
        "Relative to subjects with no chronic conditions, subjects with two chronic conditions received more screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers (breast cancer, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.80-10.5; cervical cancer, aOR: 4.59, 95% CI: 2.03-10.4; male colorectal cancer, aOR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.29-8.24; female colorectal cancer, aOR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.39-2.81). Low socioeconomic status was associated with not receiving any type of cancer screening consistently.",
        "Multimorbidity and high socioeconomic status were associated with higher proportions of screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers in the Japanese population. More aggressive strategies may be needed to promote screening among Japanese individuals with no chronic conditions and individuals with low socioeconomic status."
