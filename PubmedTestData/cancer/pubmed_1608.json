        "In the past decade, miRNAs have been extensively attracted the scientist's attentions as tumor suppressors or oncogenes that have been implicated in tumor progression, metastasis and intrinsic resistance to various cancer therapies. microRNA-21 (miR-21) demonstrates a potential oncogenic function and targets tumor inhibitor proteins in almost all types of cancer. miR-21 overexpression has been studied in terms of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis regulation. Inhibition of miRNA expression using antisense technology by various nanovectors of different sizes, shapes and compositions has been evolved progressively to overcome the barriers confronted by miRNA delivery. Application of miR-21 antisense oligonucleotides for treating cancerous cells has become a promising achievement for cancer therapy. Moreover, miR-21 can mediate resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. The expanding role of miR-21 functions in human cancers with an emphasis on its regulatory targets and mechanisms, miR-21 related achievements against cancer promotion have been discussed."
