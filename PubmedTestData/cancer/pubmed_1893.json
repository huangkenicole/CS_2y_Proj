        "The computed tomography (CT) features of small solid lung cancers and their changing regularity as they grow have not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the CT features of solid lung cancerous nodules (SLCNs) with different sizes and their variations.",
        "Between February 2013 and April 2018, a consecutive cohort of 224 patients (225 nodules) with confirmed primary SLCNs was enrolled. The nodules were divided into four groups based on tumor diameter (A: diameter\u2009\u2264\u20091.0\u2009cm, 35 lesions; B: 1.0\u2009cm\u2009<\u2009diameter\u2009\u2264\u20091.5\u2009cm, 60 lesions; C: 1.5\u2009cm\u2009<\u2009diameter\u2009\u2264\u20092.0\u2009cm, 63 lesions; and D: 2.0\u2009cm\u2009<\u2009diameter\u2009\u2264\u20093.0\u2009cm, 67 lesions). CT features of nodules within each group were summarized and compared.",
        "Most nodules in different groups were located in upper lobes (groups A\u2009-\u2009D:50.8%-73.1%) and had a gap from the pleura (groups A\u2009-\u2009D:89.6%-100%). The main CT features of smaller (diameter\u2009\u2264\u20091\u2009cm) and larger (diameter\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm) nodules were significantly different. As nodule diameter increased, more lesions showed a regular shape, homogeneous density, clear but coarse tumor-lung interface, lobulation, spiculation, spinous protuberance, vascular convergence, pleural retraction, bronchial truncation, and beam-shaped opacity (p\u2009<\u20090.05 for all). The presence of halo sign in all groups was similar (17.5%-22.5%; p\u2009>\u20090.05).",
        "The CT features vary among SLCNs with different sizes. Understanding their changing regularity is helpful for identifying smaller suspicious malignant nodules and early determining their nature in follow-up."
