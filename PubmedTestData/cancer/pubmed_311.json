        "Field cancerization is a concept used to explain cellular and molecular alterations in tissue associated to neoplasia and cancer. This effect was proposed by Slaughter in order to explain the development of multiple primary tumors and locally recurrent cancer. The particular changes associated with this effect, in each type of cancer, have been detected even at distances greater than 10cm off the tumor, in areas classified as normal by histopathological studies. Early detection of lung, colon, and ovary cancer has been reported by the use of Partial Wave Microscopy Spectroscopy (PWS) and has been explained in terms of the field cancerization effect. Until now, field cancerization has been studied as a field effect and we hypothesize that it can be understood as an amplifying effect of biochemical abnormalities in cells, which leads us to ask the question: Could field cancerization be interpreted as a biochemical anomaly amplification due to transformed cells? We propose this question because the biochemical changes due to field cancerization alter the dynamics of molecules and cells in abnormal tissues in comparison to normal ones, these alterations modify the interaction of intracellular and extracellular medium, as well as cellular movement. We hypothesize that field cancerization when interpreted as an amplification effect can be used for the early detection of cancer by measuring the change of cell dynamics."
