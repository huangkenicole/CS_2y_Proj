        "16 cases of lung cancer with long-term exposed to dusts in coal mine were studied by autopsies. This group of lung cancer's pathologic characteristics were: The mean of the age of death of the patients were 51.3 yrs, 10 years younger than that of the general population. In addition to the main tumor, multiple origin of bronchial mucosa with epithelial hyperplasia, metaplasia, and carcinoma in situ were seen. Dusts smear were seen under polar-microscope and identification by EDAX in H-800 electronic microscope. According to EDAX analysis, on the surface of some particles, Co, Cr, ions were detected."
