        "Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has become the standard of treatment for skin malignancies of the head and neck. However, there is a paucity of literature describing facial distributions of MMS. Anatomical location of skin cancer is an important feature to study as it can affect prognosis as well as pathogenesis of skin cancers. This study aims to analyze consistency in head and neck MMS anatomical distributions and compare differences between multiple centers. The study retrospectively reviews 5871 MMS cases performed at a single center in Chevy Chase, Maryland from January 2014 through December 2019. Results show distributions of skin cancers on the face treated with MMS consistently occur at the same anatomical sites year after year with minimal variance. This knowledge of consistency provides a foundation for future studies because it allows for comparison. Comparing and contrasting data across multiple centers can elucidate regional characteristics that may impact the pathogenesis and distribution of facial skin tumors. Many regional or demographical factors may be important in the development of cutaneous malignancies. This information should be considered when assessing risk factors for cancerous skin lesions.J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(5):506-509. doi:10.36849/JDD.6143."
