        "Cancer tissue comprises not only cancer cells, but also several types of non-cancerous cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts directly and/or indirectly communicate with the cancer cells and other types of stromal cells, to create a specific tumor microenvironment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy plays a central role in treating cancer; however, tumor re-progression (recurrence) is a significant problem for cancer patients. Cytotoxic anticancer drugs act on fibroblasts as well as cancer cells and, after chemotherapy, all surviving cells are in contact with one another in the local environment. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular interactions between surviving cancer cells and fibroblasts is necessary to prevent tumor re-progression and to sustain the effect of cytotoxic agents. After chemotherapy, the number of fibroblasts may increase, some of which are identifiable as tumor-promoting. In this review, we discuss the significance of cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumor re-progression after chemotherapy, and the potential value of targeting them to enhance clinical outcomes."
