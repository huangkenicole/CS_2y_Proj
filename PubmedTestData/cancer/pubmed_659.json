        "miRNA expression patterns vary within primary rectal cancers and play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. It is unknown, however, if these regulatory changes also play a role in local recurrent rectal cancers. In this study, the expression of various angiogenetic small non-coding ribonucleic acids, namely miRNA-21, miRNA-215, miRNA-221, and miRNA-222 were analysed in cancerous and healthy rectal tissues.",
        "miRNA expression was analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Samples were obtained from 20 patients who were treated for local recurrent rectal cancer at the Department for general and visceral surgery, Klinikum Oldenburg, Germany.",
        "No significant differences in the expression of miRNA-221, miRNA-222 and miRNA-215 were observed between cancerous and healthy rectal tissues. However, a significant differential expression was detected for miRNA-21.",
        "miRNA-21 is differentially expressed in recurrent rectal cancer tissue and healthy tissues. However, miRNA-215, miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 are not significantly differentially expressed."
