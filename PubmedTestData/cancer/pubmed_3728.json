        "The prevalence of thyroid cancer the most frequent endocrine malignancy, is rapidly increasing. Most of thyroid cancers are relatively indolent, however, some cases still possess a risk of developing into lethal types of thyroid cancer. Regarding its multistep tumorigenesis, the determination of the underlying mechanisms is a vital issue for thyroid cancer therapy. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs with a closed loop structure. Numerous circRNAs have been identified in cancerous tissues. Mounting data recommends that the biological activities of circRNAs, such as serving as microRNA or ceRNAs sponges, interacting with proteins, modulating gene translation and transcription, suggesting that circRNAs will be potential targets as well as agents for the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases, including cancer. Given that circular RNAs acts as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the thyroid cancer. Several studies documented that circular RNAs via microRNA and protein sponges could regulate a sequences of cellular and molecular mechanisms e.g., apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion that are involved in thyroid cancer pathogenesis. Herein, we summarized the role of circular RNAs as therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers in the thyroid cancer. Moreover, we highlighted the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of various cancers."
