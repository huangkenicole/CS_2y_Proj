      "AbstractText": [
        "We recently discovered a novel gene responsive to tumor-conditioned media: endothelial-derived gene 1 (EG-1). Its transcript has been shown to be present in epithelial cells, as well as in endothelial cells. In this study, we examined the levels of EG-1 protein expression in breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers, which constitute the four most common solid malignancies in the United States.",
        "Polyclonal antibodies were generated that recognize the EG-1 peptide. These antibodies were used in immunoblot analysis, as well as immunohistochemistry of multiple human clinical specimens of cancer.",
        "In immunoblots of whole cell lysates, EG-1 antibodies revealed the presence of a 22-kDa peptide. Immunohistochemistry of breast, colon, and prostate specimens showed higher levels of EG-1 peptides in cancer tissues, in comparison with their benign counterparts. However, EG-1 expression was minimal in both benign and malignant lung tissues.",
        "Here, we demonstrated that the expression of EG-1 is elevated in cancerous in comparison to benign epithelial cells, as seen in immunohistochemistry of human pathological specimens. These observations collectively support the hypothesis that the novel gene EG-1 is associated with the malignant phenotype of the common epithelial-derived cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate."
