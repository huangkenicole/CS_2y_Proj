        "Early lung cancer screening failed to reduce lung cancer mortality. New techniques such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AF) and the identification of specific genetic alteration might change future outcomes of lung cancer screening. It was the aim of our study to combine p53 analysis with white-light bronchoscopy (WL) or WL and AF to improve the diagnostic yield in a series of 36 patients with histologically proven lung cancer, pulmonary metastasis or suspected lung cancer. - Endobronchial sites were analysed by WL (n = 71), AF (Storz) (n = 34), histopathology (n = 71) and p53 mutations were examined by SSCP analysis on additional biopsies (n = 69). The overall frequency of cancerous lesions was 19, of which 14 were macroscopically visible lesions. The addition of p53 and autofluorescence improved the yield to 17 of 19 cases. In 7 preinvasive lesions (dysplasia/metaplasia) 4 were identified macroscopically and 5 of 7 lesions by all 3 methods. In the WL/p53 group the diagnostic yield was 7 of 9 cancerous lesions compared to 10 of 10 cancerous lesions in the AF group. It should be noted that all methods were associated with false positive results. However, the combination of conventional with autofluorescence bronchoscopy and mutation analysis is a promising approach which is applicable to clinical routine and may be further enhanced by the inclusion of a panel of markers of tumour progression."
