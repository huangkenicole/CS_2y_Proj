        "The criteria for cancer chemotherapy of gastric cancers proposed by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer is introduced with several effective cases. Three subtypes of judgment method--namely, measurable lesions, non-measurable but evaluable by X-ray or endoscopy, and diffuse infiltrating lesions are applied according to the shape and effect of primary foci. Measurable lesions in a case such as aPR should be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers on X-ray films. bPR is a case when chemotherapy of primary foci is markedly effective with a flattening of the randwall or polypoid part and a shrinkage of cancerous ulceration, but the size of a primary lesion is not decreased. cPR is a case when an expansion of affected site by more than 100% is proved by gastric radiogram or endoscopic image on primary focus in Borrman type 4, a synonym of gastric scirrhous clinically."
