        "Melittin is a water-soluble cationic peptide derived from bee venom that has been thoroughly studied for the cure of different cancers. However, the unwanted interactions of melittin produce hemolytic and cytotoxic effects that hinder their therapeutic applications. To overcome the shortcomings, numerous research groups have adopted different approaches, including conjugation with tumor-targeting proteins, gene therapy, and encapsulation in nanoparticles, to reduce the non-specific cytotoxic effects and potentiate their anti-cancerous activity.",
        "This article aims to provide mechanistic insights into the chemopreventive activity of melittin and its nanoversion in combination with standard anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of cancer.",
        "We looked over the pertinent research on melittin's chemopreventive properties in online databases such as PubMed and Scopus.",
        "In the present article, the anti-cancerous effects of melittin on different cancers have been discussed very nicely, as have their possible mechanisms of action to act against different tumors. Besides, it interacts with different signal molecules that regulate the diverse pathways of cancerous cells, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We also discussed the recent progress in the synergistic combination of melittin with standard anti-cancer drugs and a nano-formulated version of melittin for targeted delivery to improve its anticancer potential."
