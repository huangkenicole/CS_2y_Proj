        "Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Although chemotherapeutic agents have been effectively designed to increase the survival rates of some patients, the designed chemotherapeutic agents necessarily deliver toxic chemotherapeutic drugs to healthy tissues, resulting in serious side effects. Cancer cells can often acquire drug resistance after repeatedly administering current chemotherapeutic agents, restricting their efficacy. Given such obstacles, investigators have attempted to distribute chemotherapeutic agents using targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs), especially nanotechnology-based DDSs. The lipid-based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are a large and complex class of substances utilized to manage various diseases, especially cancers. Liposomes seem to be the most frequently employed LBNPs, owing to their high biocompatibility, bioactivity, stability, and flexibility. Solid lipid NPs and non-structured lipid carriers have lately received a lot of interest. In addition, several reports focused on novel therapies via LBNPs to manage various forms of cancer. In the present research, the latest improvements in applying LBNPs have been shown to deliver different therapeutic agents to cancerous cells and be a quite successful candidate in cancer therapy."
