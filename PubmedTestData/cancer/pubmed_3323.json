        "To explore the expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) in bladder uroepithelium cell carcinoma (BUCC) and its relevance to recurrence.",
        "Tissue samples from 45 BUCC patients who underwent total cystectomy or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and from 40 patients with non-bladder cancers who underwent special detection or treatments were collected. The level of expression of AQP1 in BUCC tissues and normal bladder tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry so as to analyze the relevance to pathological patterns and time of recurrence in BUCC patients.",
        "The expression levels of AQP1 normal bladder tissues and BUCC tissues were 2.175\u00b10.693 and 3.689\u00b10.701, respectively, and the difference was significant (t=9.99, P<0.0001). Marked increase was noted with BUCC histological grade and pathological stage (P<0.01). Moreover, the expression of AQP1 was evidently higher in cancerous tissues with lymph node metastasis than in those without (P<0.01). With short-term recurrence, the positive cell expression rate of AQP1 was higher in primary tissues, which increased obviously after recurrence. Additionally, the recurrent time of BUCC was negatively associated with the positive cell expression rate of AQP1 and the difference between the expression of AQP1 before and after recurrence (r=-0.843, F=39.302, P=0.000; r=-0.829, F=35.191, P=0.000).",
        "AQP1, which reflects the grade, stage, lymph node metastasis and recurrence of BUCC, has potential guiding significance in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancarcinoma."
