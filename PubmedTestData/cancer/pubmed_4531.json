        "The authors carried out an analysis of the composition of cellular interaction in the stroma of the stage I A and I B of the cervical cancer in 177 patients. The results of the investigation indicate that the composition of the reaction depends on the biologic state of cancerous tissue, the way of its proliferation and the structure of parablastomatous connective tissue. The interaction in the stroma of cancer with progressive growth is inhibited on the level of low-differentiated lymphocytes and monocytes. In the cancer with chronic progressive growth containing fibrogenic type stroma aggregations of plasmacytes were predominant. The fields built of myxoid stroma were deprived of cellular reaction. The cancer containing basement-membrane-like structures was characterised by high-differentiated lymphocytes and plasmocytes equal ratio, the presence of mature macrophages and segmentary regression of neoplastic cells. In the parablastomatous connective tissue of microinvasive cancer there was a direct contact of neoplastic cells with adequately reactive lymphocytes and macrophages."
