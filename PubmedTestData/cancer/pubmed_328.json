        "The armadillo repeat proteins were first found in armadillo gene of Drosophila. Since then a number of proteins containing armadillo repeats have been noticed and studied. These proteins that consist of 6 to 13 armadillo repeat domains are classified as family of armadillo repeat proteins. Recently, several studies indicated that armadillo repeat family of proteins play an important role in the tumorigenesis and maintenance of tissue integrity. ALEX1 (Arm protein lost in epithelial cancers, on chromosome X), contains two armadillo repeats domains, is expressed different in normal and carcinomas tissues. Several studies have found that ALEX1 protein lost in tumors that originated in epithelial tissues. We evaluated the ALEX1 protein expression in 53 cervical cancers and in 53 non-cancerous cervical tissues from patients and adjacent non-cancerous tissues using immunohistochemistry",
        "ALEX1 protein expression is significantly increased in 53 cervical cancers tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. We found, for the first time, that ALEX1 protein expression in cervical cancers tissues is higher than non-cancerous tissues. It is suggested that the ALEX1 protein is associated with tumorigenesis in cervical cancer and we speculate that the ALEX1 may plays a role as an oncogene in cervical cancer. Moreover, ALEX1 may serve as a novel potential diagnostic biomarker in identifying cervical cancer."
