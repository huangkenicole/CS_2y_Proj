        "Cancer progression is closely related to the tumor microenvironment in which the tumor exists, including surrounding blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix. Tumors can influence the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signals, promoting tumor angiogenesis and inducing peripheral immune tolerance, while the immune cells in the microenvironment can impact the growth and evolution of cancerous cells. One of major cell components in the tumor microenvironment is myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which promote tumor growth and metastasis directly or indirectly by recognizing other immune cells, producing cytokines and exerting their immunosuppression functions. MDSCs have emerged as major regulators of immune responses in cancer and key targets for treating cancer. There are many limitations and side-effect in approaches of conventional cancer therapy, including radiotherapy. It has grown up to be a burgeoning field that a combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy applied to cancer therapy. Therefore, it is fundamental to explore the immune mechanism in the process of cancer treatment. Here, we reviewed the recent progress of MDSCs in roles of the tumor microenvironment and tumor radiotherapy."
