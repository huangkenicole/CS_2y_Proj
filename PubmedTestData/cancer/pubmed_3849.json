        "Cancer-associated mortality is increased in psoriasis. However, little is known about the risk of less common cancers.",
        "We aimed to evaluate the risk of less common cancers in patients with psoriasis compared to persons without psoriasis using a nationwide cohort study.",
        "Between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012, we identified all Danish patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of a less common cancer defined as <100 new cases/year/100.000 persons in Denmark. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a diagnosis of cancer.",
        "We included 4\u00a0361\u00a0869 individuals. Of these, 58\u00a0138 were classified as having psoriasis. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and healthcare consumption, we found significantly elevated hazard ratios for cancers of bone and cartilage (HR 4.97 [2.32-10.62], P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in patients with psoriasis on systemic treatment.",
        "We provide further evidence of an increased cancer of bone and cartilage risk in patients with psoriasis."
