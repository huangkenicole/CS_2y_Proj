        "Pancreatic carcinoma carries a poor prognosis, especially invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. This retrospective study describes the results of the treatment and prognosis for double cancers in which cancer of the pancreas was associated with malignancies in other organs in 12 patients who were diagnosed and treated at Kurume University Hospital. The patients included 4 women and 8 men, with an average age of 67 years. Of the 12 tumors, 7 were metachronous pancreatic cancers which occurred after resections of other organ malignancies. Five patients had synchronous double cancers, one of whom was diagnosed to have gastric cancer on admission. Two other patients of this group were diagnosed to have lung cancer, while the remaining 2 patients suffered from colon cancer. By the time pancreatic cancer was diagnosed, gastrectomies had been performed in 7 patients for either gastric cancer or ulcers. In addition, one patient underwent a hysterectomy for uterine carcinoma and another received a low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma. Four of 5 patients in the synchronous group had nonresectable tumors and a palliative bypass operation was performed in 2 of these patients. Six patients who had metachronous double cancers died because of pancreatic cancer recurrence or metastases. We conclude that the prognosis of double cancers, where cancer of the pancreas is associated with other organ malignancies, primarily depends on the prognosis of the pancreatic carcinoma, and the present study suggests the necessity of long-term follow-up examinations for gastrectomy patients in order to make an early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer."
