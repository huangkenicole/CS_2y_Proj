        "In 1953, Slaughter et al. [D. P. Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical significance for the development of second primary tumors and local recurrences. To define the process of field cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to determine the extension of the field. In these cases, additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53 mutations were included to determine subclonal differences between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were detected in 36% (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The field varied in size between patients and consisted of genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the field extended into the surgical margins. One particular patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the nonresected premalignant field than with the original tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed further into a new malignancy. Our data show that genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment of these genetically altered fields may have profound implications for future patient management."
