      "AbstractText": [
        "Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a technology that enables microscopic visualization of lesions in real-time (optical biopsy) and has been successfully applied for clinical use in gastroenterology. Recently, it was also introduced for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) diagnostics. We previously designed a self-made CLE, which can provide bichrome images, with topical contrast agents that are safe for use in patients. Herein, we report findings of a pilot study using our self-made CLE to image pairs of normal and cancerous tissues. This study aimed to characterize the features of HNSCC compared with normal mucosa and to establish a methodology of in vivo real-time optical biopsy of HNSCCs.",
        "HNSCC tissues were acquired from 10 patients who underwent surgical resection. Dissected specimens were first evaluated for their auto-fluorescence spectral profiles with 473\u00a0nm laser excitation and further optical observation. While obtaining the image, auto-fluorescence spectrum and intensity of the reflectance fluorescent signals were measured in real-time by a spectrometer. Subsequently, acriflavine was applied to the specimen to fluorescently label the nuclei and observe the difference between normal and cancerous tissues with 473\u00a0nm laser excitation. Finally, double staining with acriflavine and edible Food Red No.106 was performed to observe both nuclei and the cytoplasm of normal and cancerous tissues at 473\u00a0nm and 561\u00a0nm laser excitation.",
        "Lower signals were detected from auto-fluorescence images of cancer tissues than normal tissues with 473\u00a0nm laser excitation. After acriflavine application, there was a clear difference between cancer and normal mucosa in the uniformity of nuclear size and shape. In normal mucosa, cells were arranged in an orderly manner, with each cell resembling a frog's egg. By contrast, in cancer tissues, the cell density was higher, and the cellular arrangement was less orderly. Using both acriflavine and Food Red No.106, images became more vivid, but more complicated because red dye staining of the cytoplasm emerged as fluorescence at different wavelengths.",
        "Real-time in vivo imaging using the newly developed CLE and conditions may be used to distinguish cancer tissue from normal mucosa without invasive biopsy."
