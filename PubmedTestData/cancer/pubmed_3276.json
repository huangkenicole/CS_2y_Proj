        "Lung cancer has a high mortality rate worldwide. Non\u2011SMC condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH) has been identified to be one of the regulatory subunits of the condensin I complex, which is essential for the correct packaging and segregation of chromosomes in eukaryotes. NCAPH is abnormally overexpressed in various types of cancer. A pro\u2011survival member of the Bcl\u20112 family, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl\u20111) is also frequently overexpressed in multiple cancers and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes for patients. The association of NCAPH and Mcl\u20111 proteins with the clinical and pathological features of non\u2011small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be elucidated. In the current study, the positive percentage of NCAPH in the non\u2011cancerous lung tissues was revealed to be higher compared with that in NSCLC. However, the positive percentage of Mcl\u20111 in the non\u2011cancerous lung tissues was lower compared with NSCLC. In addition, NCAPH high\u2011expression patients had a higher overall survival rate compared with patients exhibiting low expression, whereas the Mcl\u20111 high\u2011expression group had a lower survival rate. Pairwise association in 260\u00a0cases of NSCLC revealed that overexpression of the NCAPH protein was negatively associated with Mcl\u20111 expression and vice versa. The results of multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis also indicated that NCAPH and Mcl\u20111 demonstrated potential as distinct prognostic factors that may be used in NSCLC. The expression of NCAPH and Mcl\u20111 may be associated with, and act as distinct molecular marks for the prediction of a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC."
