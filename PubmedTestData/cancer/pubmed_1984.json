        "Circulating tumor cells (CTC) disseminate from primary tumors by undergoing epithelial mesenchymal transition that allow their entry into the circulation to drive metastatic formation in pancreatic cancer patients.Technological advances in detection and characterization of CTC are conducive to the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and predicating the probability of canceration or the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Nowadays, detection methods of CTC can be based on immunomagnetic beads technique, cell filtration or microfluidic chips technology, but there are great differences in the sample throughput, CTC recovery rate, purity, and CTC viability among them.Owing to the dilemma in detection methods, the intrinsic relevance between the biological characteristics of CTC and clinical manifestations is still not exactly elucidated. By the improved methodology, next generation sequencing technology and exploring the technique for culturing CTC <i>in vitro</i> and establishing xenotransplanted tumor model in nude mice, more and more biological information will be revealed, and finally, individualized treatment is achieved."
