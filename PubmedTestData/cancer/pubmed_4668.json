        "BackgroundSegmental neurofibromatosis, referred to as mosaic neurofibromatosis 1, patients present with neurofibromas or caf\u00e9 au lait macules or both in a unilateral segment of the body.PurposeA woman with segmental neurofibromatosis and triple cancer (renal cell carcinoma, mixed thyroid carcinoma, and lentigo maligna) is described and cancers observed in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis are reviewed.MethodsPubMed was used to search the following terms, separately and in combination: cancer, malignancy, mosaic, neoplasm, neurofibroma, neurofibromatosis, segment, segmental, tumor.ResultsMalignancy (13 cancers) has been observed in 11 segmental neurofibromatosis patients; one patient had three different cancers. The most common neoplasms were of neural crest origin {malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (3 patients) and melanoma (3 patients)] and gastrointestinal tract origin [colon (1 patient) and gastric (1 patient)]. Breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and thyroid cancer each occurred in one patient.ConclusionsSimilar to patients with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis 1, individuals with segmental neurofibromatosis also have a genodermatosis-associated increased risk of developing cancer."
