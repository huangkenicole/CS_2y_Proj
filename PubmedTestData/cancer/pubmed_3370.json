        "Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique that allows specific chemical information to be obtained from various types of sample. The detailed molecular information that is present in Raman spectra permits monitoring of biochemical changes that occur in diseases, such as cancer, and can be used for the early detection and diagnosis of the disease, for monitoring treatment, and to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous biological samples. Several techniques have been developed to enhance the capabilities of Raman spectroscopy by improving detection sensitivity, reducing imaging times and increasing the potential applicability for <i>in vivo</i> analysis. The different Raman techniques each have their own advantages that can accommodate the alternative detection formats, allowing the techniques to be applied in several ways for the detection and diagnosis of cancer. This feature article discusses the various forms of Raman spectroscopy, how they have been applied for cancer detection, and the adaptation of the techniques towards their use for <i>in vivo</i> cancer detection and in clinical diagnostics. Despite the advances in Raman spectroscopy, the clinical application of the technique is still limited and certain challenges must be overcome to enable clinical translation. We provide an outlook on the future of the techniques in this area and what we believe is required to allow the potential of Raman spectroscopy to be achieved for clinical cancer diagnostics."
