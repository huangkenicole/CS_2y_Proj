        "The abnormalities of the haemoglobin divide into qualitative abnormalities and quantitative abnormalities. This variant contains polymorphisms often useful as markers of population. At present more than 693 types of abnormal haemoglobin are listed. This hemoglobinopathies can arise at reached subjects of cancerous pathologies.",
        "To bring to report association h\u00e9moglobinopathies-cancers.",
        "Our study was realized to the Institute Salah azaiz (ISA) concerning h\u00e9moglobinopathies in carcinologic environment over a period spreading out of May 2004 in February 2008. The phenotypic and biochemical study of haemoglobin revealed the presence of 328 carriers of abnormalities of the haemoglobin on a total of 10550 patients followed to ISA. 7 types of abnormalities of the haemoglobin were identified (HbS, Hb C, Hb O arab, Hb D, Hb G, fast mutant and \u00df thalassemia.",
        "The sickle cell line represents the most wide-spread h\u00e9moglobinopathie (51.3 %). 48.2 % of the carrier subjects of abnormalities of the haemoglobin are followed for malignant pathologies. Among these hemoglobinopathies, we revealed the presence of two fast mutants of the haemoglobin corresponding to the haemoglobin Bangkok. This type of rare mutant is described for the first time in Tunisia. According to the genotypic study by these two cases, the haemoglobin Bangkok results from the replacement at the level of the chain \u00df some aspartic acid by the wisteria, further to a transfer at the level of the codon 56. A phenotypic study family revealed the presence of similar transfers at certain members of the family.",
        "Our work allowed us to notice a relatively important frequency of rare abnormalities of the haemoglobin at patients presenting varied tumoral processes."
