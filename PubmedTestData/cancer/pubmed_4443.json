        "In recent times, nanotechnology has made significant advances in the field of cancer. The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs do not selectively target cancer cells, and they might cause side effects and damage to healthy cells, resulting in a variety of adverse effects. Having a thorough understanding of nanoparticles may improve drug targeting and administration. The nano-engineering of pharmacological and natural compounds can improve the diagnosis and treatment. Polymeric micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers are examples of innovative cancer therapeutic nano-formulations. It has been demonstrated that quantum dots, nano-suspensions, and gold nanoparticles can improve drug delivery. Nanomedicines may be delivered more effectively, focusing on cancerous cells instead of healthy tissues, which minimizes undesirable side effects and drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. However, limited water solubility, low stability, poor absorption, and quick metabolism limit their therapeutic effectiveness. Nanotechnology has generated unique formulations to optimise the potential use of phytochemicals in anticancer therapy. Nanocomposites can improve phytochemical solubility and bioavailability, extend their half-life in circulation, and even transport phytochemicals to specific locations. The progress in using phytochemical-based nanoparticles in cancer treatment is summarized in this paper."
