      "AbstractText": [
        "Georgia is an upper middle-income country, which has lower cancer survival rates than most of the countries in the World Health Organization European region, as well as compared to many other post-Soviet states and upper middle-income countries. The purpose of our study was to analyse the cancer stage distribution data of Georgia as a first step towards identifying the areas of early cancer detection in the country that might need improvement or require further research.",
        "Descriptive analysis of the population-based cancer registry of Georgia was performed using the data for the period of 01.01.2018-31.12.2019.",
        "Around 57\u00a0% of cancers in males and 56\u00a0% of cancers in females were amenable to early detection. At least 35.7\u00a0% of these cancers in males and 44.2\u00a0% in females were detected early. 15.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0964) of male and 35.3\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a03179) of female cancer patients met the age criteria for the respective cancer screening programmes. Breast, colorectal, cervical and stomach cancers contributed to 58.7\u00a0% of all late-stage cancers in females. Lung, prostate, colorectal, laryngeal and stomach cancers made up 72.4\u00a0% of all late-stage cancer cases among males. At least 83.8\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a01438) of thyroid cancers in females and 84.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0246) of thyroid cancers in males were diagnosed at stage I. Moreover, stage I thyroid cancer cases made up 50.7\u00a0% of all stage I cancer cases detected in women and 25.6\u00a0% of all stage I cancers in men. At least 42.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in females and 37.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in males were papillary microcarcinomas.",
        "The potential of early cancer detection is underutilised in Georgia and there is a need to strengthen screening and especially early diagnosis in the country. The possibility of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis requires further investigation."
