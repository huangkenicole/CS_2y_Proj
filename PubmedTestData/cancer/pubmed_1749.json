      "AbstractText": [
        "Ever since the ubiquitin proteasome system was characterized, efforts have been made to manipulate its function to abrogate the progression of cancer. As a result, the anti-cancer drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib targeting the 26S proteasome were developed to treat multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, among others. Despite success, adverse side effects and drug resistance are prominent, raising the need for alternative therapeutic options. We recently demonstrated that knockdown of the 19S regulatory components, 26S proteasome non-ATPase subunits 1 (<i>PSMD1</i>) and 3 (<i>PSMD3</i>), resulted in increased apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but had no effect on normal controls, suggesting they may be good targets for therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that <i>PSMD1</i> and <i>PSMD3</i> are potential targets for anti-cancer therapeutics and that their relevance stretches beyond CML to other types of cancers. In the present study, we analyzed <i>PSMD1</i> and <i>PSMD3</i> mRNA and protein expression in cancerous tissue versus normal controls using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), comparing expression with overall survival. Altogether, our data suggest that PSMD1 and PSMD3 may be novel putative targets for cancer prognosis and therapy that are worthy of future investigation."
