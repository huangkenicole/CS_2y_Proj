        "Cancer is a complex disease with many contributing factors, and researchers have gained extensive knowledge that has helped them understand the diverse and varied nature of cancer. The altered patterns of DNA methylation found in numerous types of cancer imply that they may play a part in the disease's progression. The human cancer condition involves dysregulation of the DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B) gene, a prominent de novo DNA methyltransferase, and its abnormal behavior serves as an indicator for tumor prognosis and staging. The expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which include microRNAs (miRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), is critical in controlling targeted gene expression and protein translation and their dysregulation correlates with the onset of tumors. NcRNAs dysregulation of is a critical factor that influences the modulation of several cellular characteristics in cancerous cells. These characteristics include but are not limited to, drug responsiveness, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, proliferation, and properties of tumor stem cell. The reciprocal regulation of ncRNAs and DNMT3B can act in synergy to influence the destiny of tumor cells. Thus, a critical avenue for advancing cancer prevention and treatment is an inquiry into the interplay between DNMT3B and ncRNAs. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the ncRNAs/DNMT3B axis in cancer pathogenesis. This brings about valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and provides a foundation for developing effective therapeutic interventions."
