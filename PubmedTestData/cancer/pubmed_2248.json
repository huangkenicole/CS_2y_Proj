        "Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are a major cause of the frequent relapse observed in glioma, due to their high drug resistance and their differentiation potential. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the 'cancer stemness' of GSCs will be particularly important for improving the prognosis of glioma patients.",
        "We previously established cancerous neural stem cells (CNSCs) from immortalized human neural stem cells (F3 cells), using the H-Ras oncogene. In this study, we utilized the EGFRviii mutation, which frequently occurs in brain cancers, to establish another CNSC line (F3.EGFRviii), and characterized its stemness under spheroid culture.",
        "The F3.EGFRviii cell line was highly tumorigenic in vitro and showed high ERK1/2 activity as well as expression of a variety of genes associated with cancer stemness, such as SOX2 and NANOG, under spheroid culture conditions. Through meta-analysis, PCR super-array, and subsequent biochemical assays, the induction of MEK partner-1 (MP1, encoded by the LAMTOR3 gene) was shown to play an important role in maintaining ERK1/2 activity during the acquisition of cancer stemness under spheroid culture conditions. High expression of this gene was also closely associated with poor prognosis in brain cancer.",
        "These data suggest that MP1 contributes to cancer stemness in EGFRviii-expressing glioma cells by driving ERK activity."
