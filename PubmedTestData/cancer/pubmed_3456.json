        "Molecular alterations in tumor-adjacent tissues have recently been recognized in some types of cancer. This phenomenon has not been studied in endometrial cancer. We aimed to analyze the expression of genes associated with cancer progression and metabolism in primary endometrial cancer samples and the matched tumor-adjacent tissues and in the samples of endometria from cancer-free patients with uterine leiomyomas. Paired samples of tumor-adjacent tissues and primary tumors from 49 patients with endometrial cancer (EC), samples of endometrium from 25 patients with leiomyomas of the uterus, and 4 endometrial cancer cell lines were examined by the RT-qPCR, for <i>MYC</i>, <i>NR5A2</i>, <i>CXCR2</i>, <i>HMGA2</i>, <i>LIN28A</i>, <i>OCT4A</i>, <i>OCT4B</i>, <i>OCT4B1</i>, <i>TWIST1</i>, <i>STK11</i>, <i>SNAI1</i>, and miR-205-5p expression. The expression levels of <i>MYC</i>, <i>NR5A2</i>, <i>SNAI1</i>, <i>TWIST1</i>, and <i>STK11</i> were significantly higher in tumor-adjacent tissues than in the matched EC samples, and this difference was not influenced by the content of cancer cells in cancer-adjacent tissues. The expression of <i>MYC</i>, <i>NR5A2</i>, and <i>SNAI1</i> was also higher in EC-adjacent tissues than in samples from cancer-free patients. In addition, the expression of <i>MYC</i> and <i>CXCR2</i> in the tumor related to non-endometrioid adenocarcinoma and reduced the risk of recurrence, respectively, and higher <i>NR5A2</i> expression in tumor-adjacent tissue increased the risk of death. In conclusion, tissues proximal to EC present higher levels of some cancer-promoting genes than the matched tumors. Malignant tumor-adjacent tissues carry a diagnostic potential and emerge as new promising target of anticancer therapy."
