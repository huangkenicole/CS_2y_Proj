        "From June 5 through June 8, 2004, the American Society of Clinical Oncology held its 45th Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The meeting was devoted to the presentation of advances in management of malignant diseases with a variety of therapeutic modalities. The meeting brings together investigators, clinicians, policy makers and professionals interested in the science and impact of novel treatments on cancerous disease. This report will examine the advances in combined modality approaches (i.e., the use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy) for the treatment of malignant disease. This review will summarize the advances reported in the use of chemoradiation for sarcomas and tumors of the genitourinary tract, brain, gastrointestinal tract, breast and lung."
