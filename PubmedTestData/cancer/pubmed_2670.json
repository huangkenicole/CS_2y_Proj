        "Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) has made a huge contribution to clinical practice. However, acquiring skill at ME-NBI diagnosis of early gastric cancer (EGC) requires considerable expertise and experience. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), using deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN), has made remarkable progress in various medical fields. Here, we constructed an AI-assisted CNN computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, based on ME-NBI images, to diagnose EGC and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system.",
        "The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system (ResNet50) was trained and validated on a dataset of 5574 ME-NBI images (3797 EGCs, 1777 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, a separate test dataset of 2300 ME-NBI images (1430 EGCs, 870 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions) was assessed using the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system.",
        "The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system required 60\u00a0s to analyze 2300 test images. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CNN were 98.7%, 98%, 100%, 100%, and 96.8%, respectively. All misdiagnosed images of EGCs were of low-quality or of superficially depressed and intestinal-type intramucosal cancers that were difficult to distinguish from gastritis, even by experienced endoscopists.",
        "The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system for ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC could process many stored ME-NBI images in a short period of time and had a high diagnostic ability. This system may have great potential for future application to real clinical settings, which could facilitate ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC in practice."
