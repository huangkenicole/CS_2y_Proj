        "The aim of this study was to ascertain the 5-year survival figures of 171 consecutive colorectal cancer patients in southwestern Finland, the differences between various age groups, and which clinical variables predict poor outcome. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 67 years in men and 69 years in women. The 5-year survival was lower in older patients, especially in those over 80 years with concomitant diseases. However, the colorectal cancer mortality did not differ between the three age groups: < 65, 65-80, > 80 years. Employing univariate analysis, a poor 5-year outcome was associated with metastases, and the outcome was excellent if the cancer was confined locally (p = 0.0001). As many as 26% of the patients in whom the cancer was confined to the bowel wall (Dukes B) at the time of operation died within 5 years. A poor survival rate was also found if the patients had emergency operations (p = 0.021). The postoperative mortality was 6%. Using logistic regression analysis, the poor 5-year survival rate was correlated strongly with metastasized cancer (p = 0.000) but less so with age (p = 0.040)."
