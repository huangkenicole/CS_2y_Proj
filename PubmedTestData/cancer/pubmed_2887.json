        "This paper reports a case of gastric carcinoma in which cancerous tissue was not found in the resected specimen, apparently due to preoperative tegafur administration. The patient was a 56-year-old woman who was diagnosed by initial endoscopic examination including endoscopic biopsy as having an advanced gastric cancer of Borrmann type 2. During the waiting period for operation, she was placed on oral administration of tegafur (Futrafur capsule) 600 mg 3 times a day for 31 days. The second endoscopic examination 14 days later showed reduction of both marginal elevation and central excavation of the lesion, and biopsy at this time was negative for carcinoma. Because of the initial definite diagnosis of cancer, a gastric resection was performed 31 days later, but no cancerous tissue was found in the resected specimen. This case was considered to be a carcinoma especially sensitive to tegafur."
