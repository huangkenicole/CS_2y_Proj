        "The \"bystander effect\" is a transmission phenomenon mediating communication from target to non-target cells, as well as cell-to-cell interactions between neighboring and distantly located cells. In this narrative review, we describe the fundamental and clinical significance of the bystander effect with respect to cell-to-cell interactions in carcinogenesis, therapeutic response, and tissue regeneration. In carcinogenesis, the bystander effect mediates communications between tumor microenvironments and non-malignant epithelial cells and has been suggested to impact heterogeneous tumorigenic cells in tumors and cancerized fields. In therapeutic response, the bystander effect mediates communications between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells and may transmit both drug efficacy and resistance. Therefore, control of therapeutic response transmission via the bystander effect might offer a promising future cancer treatment. Finally, in tissue regeneration, circulating cells and stromal cells may differentiate into various cells for the purpose of tissue regeneration under direction of the bystander effect arising from surrounding cells in a defective space. We hope that the findings we present will promote the development of innovative cancer therapies and tissue regeneration methodologies from the viewpoint of cell-to-cell interactions through the bystander effect."
