        "Cancer's high incidence and death rate jeopardize human health and life, and it has become a global public health issue. Some members of NPCs have been studied in a few cancers, but comprehensive and prognostic analysis is lacking in most cancers. In this study, we used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data genomics and transcriptome technology to examine the differential expression and prognosis of NPCs in 33 cancer samples, as well as to investigate NPCs mutations and their effect on patient prognosis and to evaluate the methylation level of NPCs in cancer. The linked mechanisms and medication resistance were subsequently investigated in order to investigate prospective tumor therapy approaches. The relationships between NPCs and immune infiltration, immune cells, immunological regulatory substances, and immune pathways were also investigated. Finally, the LUAD and KICH prognostic prediction models were built using univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of NPCs were also identified."
