        "Cancer represents a compilation of diseases characterized by rapidly dividing, invasive cells. Worldwide data indicate that over 14 million new cancers were diagnosed in 2012, with a projected increase of more than 19 million diagnosed cases by 2025 [1]. Survival rates for some cancers have increased dramatically, but there are still cancer types for which the prognosis is poor and few treatments exist. Thus, there is a growing need for new therapies targeting these difficult-to-treat cancers."
