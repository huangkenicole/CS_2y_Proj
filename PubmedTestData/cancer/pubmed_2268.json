        "Studies have suggested that cancerous tissue has a lower <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratio than benign tissue. However, human data have been inconclusive, possibly due to constraints on experimental design. Here, we used high-sensitivity nitrogen isotope methods to assess the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratio of human breast, lung, and kidney cancer tissue at unprecedented spatial resolution. In lung, breast, and urothelial carcinoma, <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N was negatively correlated with tumor cell density. The magnitude of <sup>15</sup>N depletion for a given tumor cell density was consistent across different types of lung cancer, ductal in situ and invasive breast carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, suggesting similar elevations in\u00a0the anabolism-to-catabolism ratio. However, tumor <sup>15</sup>N depletion was higher in a more aggressive metaplastic breast carcinoma. These findings may indicate the ability of certain cancers to more effectively channel N towards growth. Our results support <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N analysis as a potential tool for screening biopsies and assessing N metabolism in tumor cells."
