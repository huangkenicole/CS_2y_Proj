        "Cortactin is commonly expressed in several human cancers, which may alter their invasive or metastatic properties. Eighty five kilodalton form (p85) and 80-kDa form (p80) of cortactin are two separate bands in SDS-PAGE representing different conformational states. The objective of this study was to investigate cortactin expression in colorectal cancer (CRC).",
        "Cortactin expression was studied in an eight paired laser capture microdissection (LCM) CRC tissues and matched non-cancerous epithelia by immunoblotting. The expression in 58 CRC and two cell lines, HCT8 and HCT116, was studied respectively by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence.",
        "Dominant expression of p85 was identified in LCM-procured CRC tissues compared with equal intensity of p85 and p80 forms in non-cancerous tissues, while the amount of total cortactin was approximate. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that cortactin located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells and adjacent non-cancerous cells, and its expression was negatively correlated with TNM staging and lymphatic invasion status. However, the invasion fronts in 3 of 58 primary tumors and 28 of 39 available lymph node metastases were intensively stained. Further, immunofluorescence analysis showed that cortactin was distributed in cytoplasm and enriched in the front of the extending lamellipodia at adhering side of cultured cancer cells.",
        "Our results demonstrated the dominant expression of p85 form of cortactin in CRC for the first time. The enrichment of cortactin in the invasion front of some tumor cells and in the extending lamellipodia of cultured cancer cells suggests that cortactin may help cancer cell movement."
