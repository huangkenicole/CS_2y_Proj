        "The exact risk of second cancer (S.C.) following treatment of testicular seminoma is not well determined in most series. At our institution, 122 patients with pure seminoma were treated by orchidectomy followed by radiation therapy from 1951 to 1986. Six were lost to follow-up. For the 116 remaining patients, the overall 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-year survival probability was 95%, 90%, 87%, and 84%, respectively. Eleven patients developed 12 second cancers, with a cumulative risk of 7%, 16%, and 16% at 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Overall, the risk of second cancer was increased (O/E = 1.97, p = 0.023). There were 3 controlateral seminoma (O/E = 50, p = 0.001), 2 transitional carcinoma of the bladder (O/E = 6.9, p = 0.035), 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (N.S.), 1 acute myeloblastic leukemia, 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 intracranial dysgerminoma, 1 rectal and 1 lung adenocarcinoma. Four tumors developed within the previously irradiated field (O/E = 2.2, N.S.). Excluding second seminoma, the overall risk of second cancer was not significant (O/E = 1.33). Five of the 11 patients with second cancer are currently alive without recurrent cancer. We conclude that patients treated for seminoma have an increased risk of second cancer but the overall prognosis remains excellent. The potential factors responsible for second cancer, including irradiation, are discussed."
