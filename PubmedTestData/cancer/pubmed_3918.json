      "AbstractText": [
        "TRPM7, a divalent cation-selective channel with kinase domains, has been widely reported to potentially affect cancers. In this study, we conducted multiple bioinformatic analyses based on open databases and reviewed articles that provided evidence for the effects of TRPM7 on cancers. The purposes of this paper are 1) to provide a pan-cancer overview of TRPM7 in cancers; 2) to summarize evidence of TRPM7 effects on cancers; 3) to identify potential future studies of TRPM7 in cancer. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that no cancer-related TRPM7 mutation was found. TRPM7 is aberrantly expressed in most cancer types but the cancer-noncancer expression pattern varies across cancer types. TRPM7 was not associated with survival, TMB, or cancer stemness in most cancer types. TRPM7 affected drug sensitivity and tumor immunity in some cancer types. The in vitro evidence, preclinical in vivo evidence, and clinical evidence for TRPM7 effects on cancers as well as TRPM7 kinase substrate and TRPM7-targeting drugs associated with cancers were summarized to facilitate comparison. We matched the bioinformatics evidence to literature evidence, thereby unveiling potential avenues for future investigation of TRPM7 in cancers. We believe that this paper will help orient research toward important and relevant aspects of the role of TRPM7 in cancers."
