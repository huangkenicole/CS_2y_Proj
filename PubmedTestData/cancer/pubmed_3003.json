        "To explore the expression of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 protein in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to clarify its clinical significance.",
        "Paraffin embedded tissues from 158 primary non-small cell lung cancers and para-cancerous lung tissues were investigated for the expression of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 protein by immunohistochemistry, as well as in freshly-taken NSCLC tissues by Western blot. The relationship between the expression of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 and the biological features of lung cancer was analyzed.",
        "The positive rate of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 protein expression in lung cancer tissues was 65.19% and 51.27%, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that the level of of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 protein in NSCLC tissues was remarkably higher than that in normal tissues (P < 0.01). The expression of III \u03b2-tubulin in stage III-IV cases was significantly higher than that in stage I-II cases (P < 0.05), while the expression of MDR1 protein showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). The positive rate of III \u03b2-tubulin expression in well-moderate pathological grades was lower than that in poor ones. The positive rate of MDR1 expression in adenocarcinoma was higher than that in squamous cell carcinoma and large cell undifferentiated cancers (P < 0.01). The positive rate of expression of MDR1 protein and III \u03b2-tubulin was not correlated with sex, age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05).",
        "The expression of III \u03b2-tubulin and MDR1 may play an important role in the development and progression of human non-small cell lung cancer, and could be looked as an important index for judging the prognosis of lung cancer."
