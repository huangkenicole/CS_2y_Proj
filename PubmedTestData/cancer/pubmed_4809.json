        "The current research concerns the clinicopathological significance of MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA) expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). The expression and location of MICA protein in 14 normal oral mucous and 45 cancerous and para-cancerous tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry and levels of MICA mRNA expression in 29 cancerous and para-cancerous tissues were determined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed with the SPSS16.0 software package. MICA was found to be located in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Expression was higher in para-cancerous than in cancerous tissues (P<0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between the following: 1) para-cancerous tissue with normal mucosa; 2) normal mucosa with cancerous tissue;and 3) among different clinicopathological parameters in OSCC (P>0.05). The level of MICA mRNA was higher in OSCCs than in para-cancerous tissues, and was correlated with the regional lymph node status and disease stage (P<0.05). The levels of MICA protein and mRNA expression differ among normal oral mucosa, para-cancerous tissue, and cancerous tissue. MICA may contribute to the tumorigenesis and progression of OSCC."
