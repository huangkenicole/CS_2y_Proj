        "The occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistep development process through precancerous lesions. A precancerous lesion of HCC is classified into hepatocyte dysplasia at the cytological level and dysplastic nodules at the histological level, and the corresponding lesion subtypes have different risks of canceration. Pathology is the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of early stage HCC and its precancerous lesions. However, it also faces many difficulties and challenges, such as the accumulation of experience in the pathological diagnosis, the understanding and grasp of key points of histopathological diagnosis and differential diagnosis, the combination application of immune and molecular diagnostic markers, and many others. This article briefly discusses the key points of pathological features and differential diagnosis of precancerous lesions of HCC."
