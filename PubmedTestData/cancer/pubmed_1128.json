        "Esophageal cancer is an increasingly common type of neoplasm with a very poor prognosis. This prognosis could improve with more early tumor detection. We have previously shown that we can use an optical spectroscopy to detect field cancerization in the buccal mucosa of patients with laryngeal cancer. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether we could detect field cancerization of buccal mucosa of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).",
        "Optical measurements were performed in vivo using a novel optical technique: multidiameter single-fiber reflectance (MDSFR) spectroscopy. MDSFR spectra were acquired by a handheld probe incorporating three fiber diameters. Multiple absorption and scattering parameters that are related to the physiological and ultrastructural properties of the buccal mucosa were derived from these spectra. A linear discriminant analysis of the parameters was performed to create a combined biomarker \u03c3 to discriminate oncologic from non-oncologic patients.",
        "Twelve ESCC, 12 EAC, and 24 control patients were included in the study. The median value of our biomarker \u03c3 was significantly higher in patients with ESCC (2.07 [1.93-2.10]) than control patients (1.86 [1.73-1.95], p\u2009=\u20090.022). After cross-validation \u03c3 was able to identify ESCC patients with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 70.8%. There were no significant differences between the EAC group and the control group.",
        "Field cancerization in the buccal mucosa can be detected using optical spectroscopy in ESCC patients. This may be the first step towards non-invasive ESCC cancer screening."
