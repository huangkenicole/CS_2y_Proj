        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous mediators of RNA interference and have key roles in the modulation of gene expression under healthy, inflamed, stimulated, carcinogenic, or other cells, and tissues of a pathological state. Many studies have proved the association between miRNAs and cancer. The role of miR-326 as a tumor suppressor miRNA in much human cancer confirmed. We will explain the history and the role of miRNAs changes, especially miR-326 in cancers and other pathological conditions. Attuned with these facts, this review highlights recent preclinical and clinical research performed on miRNAs as novel promising diagnostic biomarkers of patients at early stages, prediction of prognosis, and monitoring of the patients in response to treatment. All related publications retrieved from the PubMed database, with keywords such as epigenetic, miRNA, microRNA, miR-326, cancer, diagnostic biomarker, and therapeutic target similar terms from 1899 to 2018 with limitations in the English language. Recently, researchers have focused on the impacts of miRNAs and their association in inflammatory, autoinflammatory, and cancerous conditions. Recent studies have suggested a major pathogenic role in cancers and autoinflammatory diseases. Investigations have explained the role of miRNAs in cancers, autoimmunity, and autoinflammatory diseases, and so on. The\u00a0miRNA-326 expression has an important role in cancer conditions and other diseases."
