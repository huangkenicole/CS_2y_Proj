        "Early and proper diagnosis of cancer is the most critical factor for the survival and treatment of veterinary cancer patients. In this study, we evaluated extracellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (ECPKA) level in serum as a useful cancer biomarker in dogs.",
        "ECPKA levels were detected in sera from dogs with cancers (n\u2009=\u200948), benign tumours (n\u2009=\u200918), and non-tumour diseases (n\u2009=\u2009102) as well as healthy control dogs (n\u2009=\u200954) utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",
        "Sera from dogs bearing various types of cancer exhibited markedly increased levels of ECPKA by up to 7.1-, 8.8-, and 10.9-fold compared with those from dogs harbouring benign tumours, dogs with non-tumour diseases, and healthy control dogs, respectively (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). In addition, serum ECPKA level did not show statistically significant correlation with gender, breed, or age of dogs or their non-cancerous disease conditions.",
        "Our data strongly propose that detection of serum ECPKA level is a potential and specific diagnostic tool for cancer in dogs."
