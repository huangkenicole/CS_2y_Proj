        "Objective To investigate the expression of interleukin 33 (IL-33) in cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of IL-33 in 61 pairs of cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression and location of IL-33 on paraffin sections in selected 12 cases with different pathological types, to analyze the correlation of IL-33 expression with clinicopathological variables and overall survival. Results The expression of IL-33 mRNA in cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The immunohistochemical results showed that IL-33 protein was mainly localized in the nucleus, and was obviously down-regulated in NSCLC. Besides, the expression of IL-33 was associated with histological type, but was not associated with age, gender, smoking history, differentiation status and pathological TNM stage. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the expression of IL-33 mRNA was evidently associated with post-operative overall survival of patients suffering from NSCLC. Conclusion IL-33 may play an important role in the development of NSCLC and the targeted therapy."
