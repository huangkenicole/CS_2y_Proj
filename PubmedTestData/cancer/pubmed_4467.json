        "E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor EHF plays a tumor suppressor role in prostate cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), whereas it is overexpressed and may act as an oncogene in ovarian and mammary cancers. However, its biological role in thyroid cancer remains totally unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the biological functions of EHF and its potential as a therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay, we evaluated mRNA expression of EHF in a cohort of primary papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) and matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues. The functions of knockdown and ectopic expression of EHF in thyroid cancer cells were determine by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to identify its downstream targets. Our data showed that EHF expression was significantly increased in PTCs compared with matched non-cancerous thyroid tissues. EHF knockdown significantly inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic potential in nude mice and induced cell cycle arrested and apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling pathways. On the other hand, ectopic expression of EHF in thyroid cancer cells notably promoted cell growth and invasiveness. Importantly, EHF was identified as a new transcription factor for HER2 and HER3, contributing to thyroid tumorigenesis. Altogether, our findings suggest that EHF is a novel functional oncogene in thyroid cancer by transcriptionally regulating HER2 and HER3, and may represent a potential therapeutic target for this cancer."
