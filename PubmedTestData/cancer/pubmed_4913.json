      "AbstractText": [
        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) about 22 nucleotides in size, which play an important role in gene regulation and are involved in almost all major cellular physiological processes. In recent years, the abnormal expression of miRNAs has been shown to be associated with human diseases including cancer. In the past ten years, the link between miRNAs and various cancers has been extensively studied, and the abnormal expression of miRNAs has been reported in various malignant tumors, such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Due to the high malignancy grade of these cancers, it is more necessary to develop the related diagnostic and prognostic methods. According to the study of miRNAs, many potential cancer biomarkers have been proposed for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, especially cancer, thus providing a new theoretical basis and perspective for cancer screening. The use of miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis of cancer has the advantages of being less invasive to patients, with better accuracy and lower price. In view of the important clinical significance of miRNAs in human cancer research, this article reviewed the research status of miRNAs in the above-mentioned cancers in 2021, especially in terms of diagnosis and prognosis, and provided some new perspectives and theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers."
