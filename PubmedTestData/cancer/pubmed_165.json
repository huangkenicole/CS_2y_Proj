        "Over the previous2 decades, there have been numerous advancements in the diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic management, and postoperative assessment of genitourinary malignancies.",
        "To present a review of current and novel imaging modalities and their utility in the assessment of therapeutic response in the systemic management of renal, testicular, and prostate cancers.",
        "A PubMed/Medline search of the current published literature inclusive of prospective and retrospective original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses was conducted evaluating imaging modalities for renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and testicular cancer. All relevant literature was individually reviewed and summarized to provide a concise description of the currently available imaging modalities and their efficacy in assessing treatment response of the genitourinary malignancies targeted in this review.",
        "Conventional imaging techniques play a pivotal role in predicting the treatment response of genitourinary malignancies and have, therefore, been incorporated into clinical guidelines. Advancements in imaging technology have led to increased utilization for prognostication of a genitourinary cancer's response to therapy.",
        "A good understanding of current recommended imaging techniques to evaluate treatment response in genitourinary malignancies is of paramount importance for today's clinician, who faces increasing treatment modalities.",
        "In this review, we summarize available imaging modalities in the evaluation of treatment response in kidney, prostate, or testicular tumors. We believe that a good understanding of current imaging modalities is of paramount importance for healthcare providers treating these cancers."
