        "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been extensively identified in eukaryotic genomes and have been shown to play critical roles in the development of multiple cancers. Through the application and development of ribosome analysis and sequencing technologies, advanced studies have discovered the translation of lncRNAs. Although lncRNAs were originally defined as noncoding RNAs, many lncRNAs actually contain small open reading frames that are translated into peptides. This opens a broad area for the functional investigation of lncRNAs. Here, we introduce prospective methods and databases for screening lncRNAs with functional polypeptides. We also summarize the specific lncRNA-encoded proteins and their molecular mechanisms that promote or inhibit cancerous. Importantly, the role of lncRNA-encoded peptides/proteins holds promise in cancer research, but some potential challenges remain unresolved. This review includes reports on lncRNA-encoded peptides or proteins in cancer, aiming to provide theoretical basis and related references to facilitate the discovery of more functional peptides encoded by lncRNA, and to further develop new anti-cancer therapeutic targets as well as clinical biomarkers of diagnosis and prognosis."
