      "AbstractText": [
        "The MTH1 (NUDT1) gene, because it is frequently upregulated in many types of human cancers, has been considered a general marker of carcinogenesis for over two decades. The MTH1 protein hydrolyzes the oxidized mutagenic DNA precursor, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), to the corresponding 5'-monophosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate. This prevents its incorporation into DNA by DNA polymerases and protects cells from the accumulation of 8-oxo-dGTP-induced point mutations. Elevated MTH1 mRNA and protein in many types of human cancer indicate a worse prognosis. However, the enzymatic activity of MTH1 has remained largely uninvestigated in this context. Therefore, we have set out to determine the specific 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of MTH1 in 57 pairs of human colorectal cancers (CRC) and adjacent cancer-free tissues (CFCF). The goal was to ascertain the potential for measuring this enzymatic activity as a way to differentiate cancerous from non-cancerous specimens of the intestine, as well as defining its capabilities as a prognostic value for disease-free survival. We found that 79% of CRC tumors exhibited a higher MTH1 activity than did CFCF, with a significant 1.6-fold increase in overall median value (p\u00a0<\u00a01E-6). The 8-oxo-dGTPase in both tissues was proportional to the corresponding levels of MTH1 protein, as assayed by Western blotting. Activity higher than the ROC-optimized threshold (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.71) indicated cancerous tissue, with a 54% sensitivity and an 83% specificity. Postoperative fate followed for up to 100 months showed that higher 8-oxo-dGTPase, in either the CFCF or the CRC tumor, clearly lowered the probability of a relapse-free survival, although borderline statistical significance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was crossed only for the CFCF."
