        "Multidrug resistance to anticancer drugs proved to be related to the MDR1 gene which encodes the P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug-efflux pump for lipophilic drugs. We investigated the expression of the MDR1 gene in clinical samples by RT-PCR. The subjects were all resected cases of 14 colorectal cancers, five gastric cancers, two esophageal cancers, two gallbladder cancers and 20 lung cancers. Adrenal gland was used as a positive control. Total RNA was extracted from a fresh tissue sample. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 microgram of total RNA using reverse transcriptase. With the above cDNA as the template, amplification of the 157-bp fragment of the MDR1 gene was performed using PCR. The PCR product was polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresed and ethidium bromide-stained. In addition, a dot blot analysis was performed to quantify the amount of PCR product. Since PCR was performed simultaneously under the same conditions, the PCR product was quantified at four stages, from (3+) to (-), to indicate the degree of expression of MDR1 mRNA. Adrenal gland showed (3+)-(2+) and colorectal cancer exhibited mostly (2+)-(1+). Both cancerous and non-cancerous areas evidenced a similar degree of expression in the cases of colorectal cancer. The MDR1 gene was expressed at low levels in other digestive tract cancers and in lung cancer. The levels of MDR1 expression revealed no correlation to either histological type or clinical stage. The present method may contribute to designing anti-cancer protocols."
