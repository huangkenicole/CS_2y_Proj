      "AbstractText": [
        "Gastric cancer (GC) is a complicated multifactorial neoplasm with a high fatality and prevalence rate around the globe that required the discovery of many unknown mechanisms involved in its inception and progression. The aim of this project was to investigate the alterations of GClnc1 expression in cancerous tissues relative to marginal non-cancerous tissues of patients with GC and its association with clinicopathological features.",
        "In this research, the expression level of GClnc1 was assessed using the qRT-PCR. For this, 80 pairs of cancerous and marginal non-cancerous GC samples tissues were gathered. Then RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were carried out. Eventually, the difference of GClnc1 expression levels in tumor tissue relative to marginal non-tumor tissue specimens of GC patients and its association with pathological characteristics, as well as biomarker's performance of GClnc1, was investigated.",
        "Expression data examination of GClnc1 indicates increased expression in GC tumor tissues relative to marginal non-cancerous tissues (p < 0.0001). GClnc1 overexpression was significantly linked with pathological features of patients with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.037) and H. pylori infection (p = 0.029). Based on ROC analysis, the GClnc1 as a biomarker has AUC, sensitivity%, and specificity% of 0.8228, 90%, and 61.67%, respec-tively (p < 0.0001).",
        "Due to the GClnc1 increased expression in tumor tissues of GC patients, our research proposed that GClnc1 may be involved in the promotion and development of GC cells as a novel oncogene. Besides, in the molecular targeted therapies of GC patients, GClnc1 can be considered as a potential biomarker."
