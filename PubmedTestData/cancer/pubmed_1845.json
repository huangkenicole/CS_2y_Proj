        "Colon and gastric cancers are the widespread benign types of cancers which are synchronous and metachronous neoplasms. In terms of the progression and progress of the disease, metabolic processes and differentiation in protein structures have an important role in for treatment of the disease. In this study we proposed to investigate the metabolic process and the differentiation of protein secondary structure among colon and gastric cancer as well as healthy controls using biochemistry and Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) methods. For this purpose, we measured blood serum of 133 patients, which were conducted upon oncology department (45 colon cancer, 45 gastric cancer and 43 control individuals). The obtained spectroscopic results and biochemical assays showed significant reduction in the amount of functional groups in cancer groups contrary with total protein measurements and structure of protein differences between colon and gastric cancers. Differentiations were visible in serum levels of CEA, CA-125, CA-15-3, CA-19-9 AFP (Alpha fetoprotein) of gastric and colon cancer patients as well as in amide III and secondly described amide I regions. Our findings suggest that amide I bonds in colon cancer cells can be helpful in diagnosis of colon cancer. Indeed, our results showed that metabolic processes were higher in gastric cancer group than in colon cancer. Hence, FTIR spectroscopy and curve-fitting analysis of amide I profile can be successfully applied as tools for identifying quantitative and qualitative changes of proteins in human cancerous blood serum. However, what is very important, in PCA analysis we see, that the scatter plot of PC1 (variability 80%) and PC2 (variability 15%) show that the data related to the control and two cancer groups are clustered together with different magnitudes and directions."
