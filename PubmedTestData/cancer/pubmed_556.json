        "There are biological distinctions between gastric cancers from Eastern and Western nations, and therapeutic strategies may differ regionally. Perioperative chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) have all been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of gastric cancer. The goal of this study was to do a meta-analysis of published studies that were eligible to see if adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was helpful for gastric cancer based on the cancer's histology.",
        "From inception to May 4, 2022, manual searches were conducted to identify all eligible literature using the PubMed database for the published phase III clinical trial and a randomize-controlled trial testing the role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in operable gastric cancer.",
        "Two trials with a total of 1004 patients were selected as a result. Adjuvant CRT was found to have no effect on disease-free survival (DFS) in gastric cancer patients treated with D2 surgery (HR: 0.70 (0.62-1.02), p: 0.07). However, patients with intestinal-type gastric cancers exhibited significantly longer DFS (HR: 0.58 (0.37-0.92), p\u2009=\u20090.02).",
        "After D2 dissection, adjuvant CRT improved DFS in patients with intestinal-type gastric cancers but not in those with diffuse-type gastric cancers."
