        "Apelin, a regulatory peptide, is a ligand of the APJ receptor that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family. Apelin and APJ are widely distributed in the body and play potential physiological roles in the cytoprotection of many internal organs. This review article summarizes information about the roles of the apelin/APJ system in neurological, metabolic, hypertension, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, kidney and cancerous diseases. It is suggested that apelin positively affects the treatment of non-cancerous diseases and may be considered as a therapeutic drug in many illnesses. However, in cancers, apelin appears as a tumour growth stimulator, and its suggested role is as a marker in the diagnosis of tumour cancers in tissues. In summary, apelin has certain therapeutic abilities and can be useful in the treatment of, e.g., insulin resistance, hypertension, etc., but it also can sometimes serve as a negative factor."
