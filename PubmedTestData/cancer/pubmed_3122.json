        "Bone tumors are relatively rare, which are complex cancers and primarily involve the long bones and pelvis. Bone cancer is mainly categorized into osteosarcoma (OS), chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Of these, OS is the most intimidating cancer of the bone tissue, which is mostly found in the log bones in young children and older adults. Conspicuously, the current chemotherapy modalities used for the treatment of OS often fail mainly due to (i) the non-specific detrimental effects on normal healthy cells/tissues, (ii) the possible emergence of drug resistance mechanisms by cancer cells, and (iii) difficulty in the efficient delivery of anticancer drugs to the target cells. To impose the maximal therapeutic impacts on cancerous cells, it is of paramount necessity to specifically deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor site and target the diseased cells using advanced nanoscale multifunctional drug delivery systems (DDSs) developed using organic and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs). In this review, we provide deep insights into the development of various DDSs applied in targeting and eradicating OS. We elaborate on different DDSs developed using biomaterials, including chitosan, collagen, poly(lactic acid), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), polycaprolactone, poly(ethylene glycol), polyvinyl alcohol, polyethyleneimine, quantum dots, polypeptide, lipid NPs, and exosomes. We also discuss DDSs established using inorganic nanoscale materials such as magnetic NPs, gold, zinc, titanium NPs, ceramic materials, silica, silver NPs, and platinum NPs. We further highlight anticancer drugs' role in bone cancer therapy and the biocompatibility of nanocarriers for OS treatment."
