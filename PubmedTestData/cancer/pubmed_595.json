        "To study the cancer blocking effect of the Qi-lan granulates in SD rats.",
        "A total of 150 SD rats were divided into five groups A,B,C,D,E. Rats in group A, B, C, D were fed with 0.002% 4NQO dissolved in drinking water to induce tongue carcinogenesis in rats. Different concentration of the herb Qi-lan granulates was given to the rats of group B, C, D during oral carcinogenesis. Group A was model group, group E was normal group. The rats were sacrificed at 9, 18, 27 and 36 weeks respectively from the beginning of the experiment. The samples were collected for histophology and PCNA immunohistochemistry. The date was analyzed by Chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test using SPSS13.0 software package.",
        "The overall canceration rate of group B (14.29%), C (3.57%), D (14.29%) was significantly lower than group A (39.29%) (P<0.05), the effect of Qi-lan granulates in group C was the best. Immunohistochemistry result showed that 6 cases of normal oral mucosa in group A had positive expression of PCNA. In 11 cases of dysplasia, 8 had positive express of PCNA, 11 rats with oral cancerous tissues had positive expression of PCNA.In group A, the expression of PCNA was normal tissue<dysplasia tissue<tongue cancer tissue (P<0.05). The expression rate of PCNA in tongue dysplasia from rats in group A(8/11) was significantly higher than the other group B (6/15), C (4/14) and D(3/13) (P<0.05). But in cancer tissues, the expression of PCNA in group A was not significantly different from group B,C and D (P>0.05). In general, the expression of PCNA in group A was significantly higher than the Qi-lan granulates group, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression of PCNA in group E was negative.",
