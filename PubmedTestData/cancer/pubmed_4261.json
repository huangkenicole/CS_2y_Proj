        "ITGA2 (Integrin alpha-2) has been detected to be over-expressed in a number of cancers and has been suggested to be involved in cell adhesion and cell-surface mediated signaling. Our previous study using bioinformatic analyses has shown that ITGA2 might be a key gene being involved in the Cadmium-induced malignant transformation of liver cells. In the present study, we firstly aimed to learn the possible functions of ITGA2 via bioinformatics analysis, and then test its expression and clinical significance in liver carcinoma specimens through laboratory experiments. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis has been conducted in Genecards. Then, a tissue microarray containing 90 cases of liver cancer and 90 paired adjacent non-cancerous samples was used for detection of ITGA2 expression by immunohistochemistry assay. Consequently, ITGA2 may be enriched in pathways regarding cell adhesion and migration. PPI analysis suggests that ITGA1, ITGB2, FLT4, LAMB1 and AGRN may have a close relationship with ITGA2. No association between ITGA2 expression and clinical parameters was observed. However, the data showed that ITGA2 might be an independent prognostic factor for liver cancer patients. In conclusion, the data suggest that ITGA2 over-expression might be a potential unfavorable prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for liver carcinoma."
