        "A family history of certain malignancies, especially breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancers, can place persons at increased risk of developing these cancers. By constructing a pedigree that includes 3 generations, family physicians can identify patients at increased risk because of family cancer history. Persons at increased cancer risk because of family history warrant a surveillance strategy for early detection. Genetic professionals represent an important resource in assessing genetic risk and possible testing. Persons identified as being at increased risk of various cancers based on their family history should understand the surveillance plan that is recommended and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and remaining up to date on other cancer screening tests."
