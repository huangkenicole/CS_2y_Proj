        "We have investigated mammary gland tissues of female rats treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene in sesame oil by a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy finding that the DNA and water contents in the cancerous tissues were larger than those in the normal tissues but that the lipid content in the former was less than that in the latter. With protein contents, however, little difference was observed between the two. Thus, we used a lipid band around 1725 nm (the first overtone of n-alkane) and a protein band around 2054 nm (a combination band of amide A and amide II of polypeptides) for a quantitative evaluation of malignant changes in the mammary gland tissues. The lipid/protein band intensity ratios were calculated from the spectra of the mammary glands in the control animals and those of the noncancerous and cancerous sites in the treated animals. The lipid/protein ratios in the control animals, in the noncancerous sites, and in the cancerous sites were 1.452 +/- 0.221 (n = 5), 0.728 +/- 0.069 (n = 5), and 0.362 +/- 0.060 (n = 5), respectively. These values were significantly different from each other (P < 0.001). The lipid changes observed by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy were confirmed by the results obtained from chemical methods for the evaluation of lipid levels in the same samples. Thus, our NIR spectroscopic method would be able not only to discriminate between cancerous and normal tissues but also to distinguish animals with cancers from normal animals. In addition, as the cancer grew, the lipid band intensity decreased, this band was shifted to higher wavelengths, and collagen peaks appeared in the tissues. These findings were supported by histological examinations of the cancerous and normal tissues. The present study indicates that NIR spectroscopy has high specificity and sensitivity in discriminating cancerous tissues from normal mammary glands in animals and it may offer potential for noninvasive, in vivo diagnosis of female breast cancer in the near future."
