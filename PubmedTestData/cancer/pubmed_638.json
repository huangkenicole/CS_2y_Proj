      "AbstractText": [
        "Using the simple thin layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, serum alkaline phosphatase could be separated 5 isozyme bands in various digestive diseases, consisting of 54 cases of gastric cancer, 11 of colonic cancer, 12 of hepatoma, 4 of cholangioma, 14 of pancreatic cancer, 81 of benign hepatobilliary diseases, 13 of cancers of other organs and 61 of control. The obtained results were as follows: 1) The electrophoretic analysis of serum alkaline phosphatase showed the specific band remaining at the origin, already reported as \"alkaline phosphatase O\", in primary and metastatic cancer of the liver and cholelithiasis. On the contrary, alkaline phosphatase O was never found in gastric and colonic cancer without cholelithiasis. On the contrary, alkaline phosphatase O was never found in gastric and colonic cancer without cancerous metastasis to the liver, and it was also inclined to be positive with the progress of liver metastasis among them. 2) Intestinal alkaline phosphatase was usually found in higher frequency in blood group B and O than in the others, and it was apt to disappear in gastric or colonic cancer with an exacerbation of its cancerous lesions. 3) Heat-stable alkaline phosphatase was found in 10% of gastric or colonic cancer, all of which were histologically proved to be well differentiated adenocarcinoma."
