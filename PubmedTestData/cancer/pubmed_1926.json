        "Cyclin D1 is associated with cell cycle regulation and has more recently been shown to stimulate the transcriptional functions of the oestrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore, in normal breast there is a negative association between expression of ER and the proliferation marker Ki67 indicating that either ER positive cells are non-dividing or that the receptor is down-regulated as cells enter cycle. This important relationship breaks down in many ER-positive cancers and precancerous breast lesions where the receptor is often detected on proliferating cells. The aims of the present study were to determine the interplay between ER, Ki67 and cyclin D(1)in individual cells within the spectrum of human breast lesions ranging from normal to invasive carcinoma by using dual staining immunofluorescence. We found that in normal breast there was a strong positive association between ER and cyclin D(1)expression. In contrast there was a strong negative association between cyclin D(1)and Ki67 expression. Similar findings were seen for the other precancerous and cancerous breast lesions. Thus immunodetectable cyclin D(1)within individual cells does not appear to be associated with cell cycle progression in the benign or malignant breast but instead may have important interactions with ER."
