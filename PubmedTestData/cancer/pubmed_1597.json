        "A 65-year-old woman with a 20-year history of metrorrhagia had been treated with estrogens since menopause. In December 1974, a tumor was discovered and treated with medroxyprogesterone 250 mg/day. In 10 days the abnormal image on the X-ray was almost gone. After 1 month the thoracic image was normal. The treatment was similar until April; then 250 mg every 2 days, 20 days/month. A hysterectomy was done in September 1975. From the time of removal, 500 mg/week were given without side effects. In June 1976, the woman was in good health and the thoracic X-ray was normal. All X-rays indicating a metastatic lung should prompt a search for a uterine tumor in monopausal women because many are curable. Total histologic recoveries have been reported in cases considered too late for radiotherapy or surgery. Doses of 1 gm/week are recommended for 6 months and 500 mg/week if tolerance is high. The progesterone makes the cancerous tissue sensitive to radiotherapy and indicates 90% survival to 5 years and 100% if accompanied by surgery. Medroxyprogesterone is especially useful for cancers of the endometrium occurring in postmenopausal women who have had long-term use of estrogens."
