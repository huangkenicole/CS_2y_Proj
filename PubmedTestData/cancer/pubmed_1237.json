        "Matrilysin is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family which is believed to play an important role in tumor progression. Expression of matrilysin mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction combined with Southern blot analysis in 46 human primary gastric cancers. Overexpression of matrilysin was observed in 28 (61%) of gastric cancer tissues. The positive expression ratio of matrilysin was significantly higher in the gastric cancers of subserosa or beyond it than in those within the submucosal layer. Immunohistochemical study with anti-matrilysin monoclonal antibody revealed that matrilysin was mainly expressed on cancer cells but not or very weakly expressed on other cells. In addition, an activated form of matrilysin detected by zymographic analysis was observed in gastric cancer tissues whereas none was detected in non-cancerous tissues, suggesting that matrilysin may directly and powerfully contribute to the invasion step of human gastric cancer. In order to gain more insight into the relationship of this metalloproteinase to invasive activity, we also modulated the expression of matrilysin in gastric cancer cells by DNA transfection using gastric cancer cell lines. Overexpression of matrilysin rendered the gastric cancer cells more invasive in vitro. Concomitant with clinical investigations, matrilysin may be an important metalloproteinase in the progression of gastric cancer."
