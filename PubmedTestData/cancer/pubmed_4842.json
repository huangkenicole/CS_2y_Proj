        "Cancer is a multistep disease incorporating physical, chemical, environmental, metabolic and genetic factors, which play direct or indirect role in the induction and deterioration of cancer. Many of the platinum based drugs were synthesized but due to their systemic toxicity, broad spectrum of action, intrinsic and acquired drug resistivity, it has become necessary to search for the effective anticancer drugs with superior efficiency. Among non-platinum metal compounds with antitumor activity, organotin complexes have proven effective management of toxicity, specific targeted drug uptake by the cancerous cell line and significant potential in the pharmaceutical chemistry. So this article provides a critical review from 2010 onwards of the anticancer activity of the organotin complexes reported by the authors worldwide and explores the landmarks for their future projection as novel anticancer chemotypes with high therapeutic indices."
