        "The genetic mutations that contribute to the transformation of healthy cells into cancerous cells have been the subject of extensive research. The molecular aberrations that lead to cancer development are often characterised by gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations in a variety of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. In this study, we investigate the genomic sequences of 20,331 primary tumours representing 41 distinct human cancer types to identify and catalogue the driver mutations present in 727 known cancer genes. Our findings reveal significant variations in the frequency of cancer gene mutations across different cancer types and highlight the frequent involvement of tumour suppressor genes (94%), oncogenes (93%), transcription factors (72%), kinases (64%), cell surface receptors (63%), and phosphatases (22%), in cancer. Additionally, our analysis reveals that cancer gene mutations are predominantly co-occurring rather than exclusive in all types of cancer. Notably, we discover that patients with tumours displaying different combinations of gene mutation patterns tend to exhibit variable survival outcomes. These findings provide new insights into the genetic landscape of cancer and bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the development of various forms of cancer."
