        "To observe the distribution of the pre-cancerous condition and pathological changes of esophageal cancer of the community residents in high-incidence area, and to provide etiological evidences for secondary prevention.",
        "An iodine-staining endoscope census was conducted in 9536 residents with high-risk factors at Feicheng, a high esophageal cancer incidence community in Shandong province. Of which, 1507 pathologic biopsies were performed and chi2 test administrated.",
        "There was no statistical significance found in biopsy pathologic diagnosis between females and males among 1507 samples. The mild and medium atypical hyperplasia was taken as pre-cancerous condition and severe atypical hyperplasia was taken as pre-cancerous lesion. Taking all the population attending census as denominator, the detection rate of the precancerous state and precancerous lesion were 6.98% (294/4214) and 1.23% (52/4214) for the males, and 3.68% (196/5322) and 0.47% (25/5322) for the females, respectively. A statistical significance was observed when comparing males with females (chi2 were 52.349 and 15.267, respectively, P < 0.05). Analyzed by age group, severe atypical hyperplasia pathological changes were mainly distributed in the age group of 50- and 65-. The constituent ratio between 45 - and 50 - was the highest for CIS. Early carcinoma was mainly distributed in five age groups from 45- to 65-. It showed that high incidence town had a high detection rate of cancer and pathological changes of esophageal cancer in the analysis of urban and rural distribution.",
        "The distribution of the pre-cancerous state and pathological changes of esophageal cancer of the residents should have provided a scientific basis for the primary and secondary prevention."
