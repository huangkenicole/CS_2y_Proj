        "To evaluate the effect of resisting canceration of herba erigerontis and that of angiopoiesis.",
        "Carcinomatous conversions of golden hamster cheek pouches induced by Salley way and obstructed by herba erigerontis were studied. Ink perfusion, analysis of images, resin cast form of micro-vessel, alpha-SMA detection and histopathological examination were applied to observe their changing patterns.",
        "The rate of leukoplakia canceration of herba erigerontis group was one time lower than that of model group. The rate of normal cells was about four times more than that of model. alpha-SMA of herba erigerontis was higher than that of model (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between angeion vessel area and density (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the resin cast form of micro-vessel showed that its configuration and spacious arrangement was similar to control group.",
        "Herba erigerontis has the function of preventing leukoplakia canceration. It has no obvious effect on angio-hyperplasia and expansion in the course of leukoplakia canceration. However, it has the protecting function on angio-configuration and spacious arrangement and the complete of angeion vessel wall. Probably its mechanism is to promote blood circulation by removing blood stasis and benign angiopoiesis so as to resist canceration."
