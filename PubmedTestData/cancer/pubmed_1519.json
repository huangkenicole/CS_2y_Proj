        "During the initial stages of gastrulation during embryonic differentiation and wound healing, Cripto-1 is a critical protein for human growth. The epithelial adhesion molecules' downregulation, the mesenchymal overexpression, and mobile proteins are important mechanisms by which Cripto-1 initiates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). As a result, the function of Cripto-1 for\u00a0inducing\u00a0EMT to increase cell migration is advantageous during embryogenesis; however, it is deleterious during the formation, growth, and\u00a0malignant tumor metastasis. The majority of malignancies are reported to have elevated levels of\u00a0Cripto-1. Cripto-1 can modify cancerous cells through its function in EMT, which enables these cells to migrate via the extracellular matrix, bloodstream, and lymphatic vessels, on their way for metastasizing to other organs. The goal of this review is to explain what role Cripto-1 plays in common cancers and to summarize how therapeutic strategies are used to interfere with this molecule to target cancers."
