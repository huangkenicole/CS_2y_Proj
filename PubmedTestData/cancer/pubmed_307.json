        "We had clinicopathologically studied early cancer-like advanced gastric cancer in relation to peptic ulcer (UI). Early cancer-like advanced cancers with the difficulty to distinguish from early gastric cancer were selected for materials. Result were as followed: 1) Early cancer-like advanced cancers were consisted of 133 lesions, of which 128 lesions (96.2%) had peptic ulcer in cancerous lesion (73 lesions were active stage and 55 lesions were scarring stage). 2) Early cancer-like advanced cancers were 17.0% in all advanced gastric cancers. Proper muscle cancer (in which depth of cancerous invasion is up to proper muscle coat) was more common in early cancer-like advanced cancers than in Borrmann type advanced cancers. 3) Early cancer-like advanced cancers with peptic ulcer showed wide intramucosal cancerous infiltration. Thus, average of maximum diameter was 51.8 mm. 4) Those ulcer were commonly reaching to proper muscle coat or subserosa. Submucosal fibrosis was prominent and scattered proliferation of tumor cells were often seen within fibrosis. 5) Extent of cancerous infiltration in mucosa was more wide than that in submucosa. The above findings have led us to consider that early cancer-like advanced cancers have grown because of high degree submucosal fibrosis by the deep ulcerations due to \"malignant cycle\"."
