        "Despite significant advances in early detection and personalized treatment, cancer is still among the leading causes of death globally. One of the possible anticancer approaches that is presently receiving a lot of attention is the development of nanocarriers capable of specific and efficient delivery of anticancer drugs. Graphene-based materials are promising nanocarriers in this respect, due to their high drug loading capacity and biocompatibility. In this review, we present an overview on the interactions of graphene-based materials with normal mammalian cells at the molecular level as well as cellular and subcellular levels, including plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and membrane-bound organelles such as lysosomes, mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisome. In parallel, we assemble the knowledge about the interactions of graphene-based materials with cancerous cells, that are considered as the potential applications of these materials for cancer therapy including metastasis treatment, targeted drug delivery, and differentiation to non-cancer stem cells. We highlight the influence of key parameters, such as the size and surface chemistry of graphene-based materials that govern the efficiency of internalization and biocompatibility of these particles in vitro and in vivo. Finally, this review aims to correlate the key parameters of graphene-based nanomaterials specially graphene oxide, such as size and surface modifications, to their interactions with the cancerous and non-cancerous cells for designing and engineering them for bio-applications and especially for therapeutic purposes."
