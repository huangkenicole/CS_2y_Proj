        "Cancer has become one of the leading causes of increased mortality. The currently employed diagnostic and therapeutic modality offers only minimal specificity towards cancerous cells and affects normal healthy cells. Targeted drug delivery systems have shown an improved efficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, as the targeted molecules specifically reach the tumor cells without exerting any undesirable effects on the normal healthy cells. Recent findings have shown that disruption of blood vasculature and lymphatics is efficient in treating various cancers. As these vessels supply nutrient and oxygen, remove wastes and help in the metastasis; therapeutic agents targeting them will be highly useful. Of the various ligands used for targeting blood vasculature and lymphatics, peptides possess great advantage over other molecules. This review article is aimed at focusing the recent findings and developments on the peptides as targeting ligands for the improved anti-angiogenesis therapy."
