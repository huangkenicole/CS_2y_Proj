        "Ciliated multinodular papilloma tumor (CMPT), a subtype of proximal bronchiolar adenoma (BA), is a rare mucin-producing papillary tumor arising in the peripheral lung. The nature of CMPT is so far controversial. The hypothesis that CMPT is a precancerous lesion that can lead to mucinous adenocarcinoma requires further research. A 61-year-old man with a ground-glass opacity (GGO) suspected to be lung adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe of his lung underwent surgical treatment. Postoperative pathology suggested that the patient had mucinous adenocarcinoma caused by cancerization from CMPT. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was utilized to detect driver mutations in tumor DNA. Among the identified mutated genes, there were regrettably no high frequency mutations. This report describes a case of mucinous adenocarcinoma caused by cancerization from CMPT, indicating that CMPT may be a neoplasm rather than a metaplastic process and provides histological evidence for the hypothesis that CMPT is a precancerous lesion of mucinous adenocarcinoma."
