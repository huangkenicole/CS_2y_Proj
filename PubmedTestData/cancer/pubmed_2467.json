        "Using the technique of atomic absorption spectrophotometry copper level was determined in cancerous tissues and in unchanged homologous tissues and in the plasma of 32 patients with digestive tract cancer (17 patients with squamous oesophageal cancer and 15 with large bowel adenocarcinoma). For examination the tissues were used, removed during operation. In the control group plasma copper concentration was determined. The purpose of the work was to establish whether the increased metabolism of cancerous tissue caused cumulation of copper in cancerous cells (as it was found in cases of many other microelements), and whether it caused a significant fluctuation of plasma copper level. It was found that in patients with large bowel cancer and oesophageal cancer the mean copper concentration in cancerous tissues was lower than that in unchanged homologous tissue. It was also found that the plasma copper level in patients with cancer was not differing from normal values."
