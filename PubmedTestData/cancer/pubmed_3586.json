        "Cancer accounts for 22 percent of all deaths in the United States and it remains the second leading cause of death across this country. The majority of these deaths are cancers of six major sites, i.e., lung, prostate, large intestine, urinary bladder, uterus and female breast. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological research indicate that approximately three-fourths of all cancer deaths are attributable to lifestyle factors. For this reason some specific cancers are, indeed, preventable. With a few straightforward changes in lifestyle behaviors such as smoking cessation, increasing fiber content and decreasing fat content of diet, reductions in certain cancers can be attained. National cancer prevention priorities should center around efforts to control and/or reduce those cancers that are pervasive and for which the evidence for preventive potential is indisputable."
