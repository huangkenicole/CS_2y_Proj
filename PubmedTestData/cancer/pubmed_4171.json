        "The mechanical properties of tissue change significantly during the progression from healthy to malignant. Quantifying the mechanical properties of breast tissue within the tumor microenvironment can help to delineate benign from cancerous stages. In this work, we study high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma in comparison with their matched tumor adjacent areas, which exhibit benign morphology. Such paired tissue cores obtained from eight patients were indented using a MEMS-based piezoresistive microcantilever, which was positioned within pre-designated epithelial and stromal areas of the specimen. Field emission scanning electron microscopy studies on breast tissue cores were performed to understand the microstructural changes from benign to malignant. The normal epithelial tissues appeared compact and organized. The appearance of cancer regions, in comparison, not only revealed increased cellularity but also showed disorganization and increased fenestration. Using this technique, reliable discrimination between epithelial and stromal regions throughout both benign and cancerous breast tissue cores was obtained. The mechanical profiling generated using this method has the potential to be an objective, reproducible, and quantitative indicator for detecting and characterizing breast cancer."
