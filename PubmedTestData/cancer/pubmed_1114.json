        "More than 35% Ib stage lung cancers have metastasised or recurrenced after operation, whose prognosis still remain poor. There're much controversy over the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy to them. This aim of this study is investigated the clinical and pathological characters influencing prognosis of the stage Ib non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the indication of postoperative chemotherapy.",
        "NSCLC patients (281 cases) who underwent lobectomy were examined. Cox proportional-hazards ratios were used to identify independent prognostic factors for survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated to estimate survival rates.",
        "Kaplan-Meier analysis show that, cancerous embolus in the blood vessel or lymphatic vessel, histologic grade and tumor location were remarkerbly associated with mortality risk (P<0.05). The poor histologic grade and cancerous embolus in the blood vessel were closely associated with increased mortality risk on multivariate analysis in stage Ib NSCLC.",
        "The low histologic grade and cancerous embolus in the blood vessel or lymphatic vessel are closely correlated with survival in the stage Ib NSCLC and can be an index for the postoperative chemotherapy."
