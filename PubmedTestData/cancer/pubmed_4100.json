        "There have been few reports on clinical characteristics of lung cancer patients with previous or simultaneous urologic cancers. Additionally, it was scarcely reported whether these patients could tolerate standard therapy. To evaluate them, we conducted a retrospective study.",
        "The records of patients with lung cancer who had previously or simultaneously urological cancers seen in our division between January 1985 and August 2007 were reviewed.",
        "During the study period, 1,105 patients with lung cancer were seen at our division. Thirteen (1.2%) had previous or simultaneous urological cancers (11 males). Eleven patients were smokers. The diagnosis of urological cancers preceded the diagnosis of lung cancer in all but three patients, for whom the diagnosis of urologic cancers was made during the workup of primary lung cancer. Histologically, the lung cancers included six squamous cell carcinomas, four adenocarcinomas, and three small cell lung cancers. Four underwent surgical resection. Six were treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy, but none of them developed severe renal toxicity. The median survival following the diagnosis of lung carcinoma for NSCLC patients was 18 months, and for SCLC it was 24 months. The cause of death in the 12 patients who died in the study period was directly related to lung cancer, and recurrence of urological cancers was observed in none of the patients.",
        "For patients with urological cancers, smoking cessation, a chest radiograph or CT scan at least yearly and swift evaluation of signs or symptoms that are suggestive of lung cancer should be recommended."
