        "An increasing number of studies indicate that cancer patients' histidine (HIS) circulating levels have changed. However, the causality between HIS and cancer is still not well established. Thus, to ascertain the causal link between HIS and cancers, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Summary-level data are derived from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The causal effects were mainly estimated using the inverse-variance weighted method (IVW). The weighted-median (WM) method and MR-Egger regression were conducted as sensitivity analyses. In the forward-MR, we found malignant neoplasm of respiratory system and intrathoracic organs (OR: 1.020; 95% CI: 1.006-1.035; p<sub>IVW</sub>\u2009=\u20090.007) genetically associated with circulating HIS. And there was no significant genetic correlation between HIS and another 11 site-specific cancers using IVW method. In the reversed-MR, we did not observe the causal relationship between HIS and 12 site-specific cancers. Our findings help clarify that HIS, as a biomarker for malignant neoplasms of respiratory system and intrathoracic organs, is causal rather than a secondary biomarker of the cancerous progression. The mechanism between histidine and cancer progression deserves further investigation."
