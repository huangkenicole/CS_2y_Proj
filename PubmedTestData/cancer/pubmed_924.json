        "S100A11, one secreted protein, is overexpressed in certain cancers. We investigated S100A11 expression in various subtypes of lung cancer and explored its role in cell proliferation. S100A11 mRNA level was examined in 45 pairs of frozen lung cancer tissues by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The specific expression and subcellular distribution of S100A11 were examined in 78 paraffin-embedded lung cancers, 2 benign lung diseases as well as 22 healthy lung tissues by immunohistochemistry. S100A11 protein level was further analyzed in the sera of 86 lung cancer patients and 50 healthy individuals by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that both mRNA and protein levels of S100A11 were overexpressed in adenocarcinomas (ADC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) compared with paired non-cancerous lung tissues, while S100A11 was detected downregulated in small cell lung cancers (SCLC). Further immunohistochemistry staining was positive for S100A11 only in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (ADC, SCC, large cell carcinomas, et al.), but not SCLC. Conclusively, we found S100A11 protein level increased in the sera of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, when S100A11 expression was knocked down in lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and LTEP-a-2, the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in vitro and in vivo."
