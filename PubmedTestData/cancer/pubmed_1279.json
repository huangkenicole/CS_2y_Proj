        "Serial biopsy specimens of gastric lesions of patients in whom cancer was diagnosed at follow-up examination were reexamined retrospectively; the source materials were 17,429 gastric biopsies carried out on 14,779 patients from 1971 to 1985 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. Among these cases, cancers were found at follow-up in 34 cases at locations distinct from the initially biopsied lesions, and in 41 cases, cancerous changes were detected at follow-up at the locations of the original lesions. These 41 cases amounted to 0.5% of the total biopsied cases with negative results. The average interval from the first to the last endoscopic examination in these 41 cases was 52.1 months and the longest interval was 150 months in the case of a scarred lesion. Based on the reexamination of the histology of the biopsy specimens taken at the first examination, these 41 cases were classified into three subgroups: 1) no precancerous atypical changes were observed, 2) doubtful precancerous changes were observed and 3) minute or slight malignant changes did exist but had been overlooked. The number of cases in the first category was 33 (80.5%), among which ulcer or its scar was most common, the number in the second category was 6 (14.6%), most of them being polypoid lesions, and the number in the third category was 2 (4.9%). Histological features of some cases in each subgroup are presented and the results are discussed."
