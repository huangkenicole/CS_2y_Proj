        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Consequently, it is essential to identify biomarkers for treatment response and the prognosis prediction. We investigated whether ABL1 can function as a biomarker or a drug target for HCC. We assessed the ABL1 expression, genetic alterations and patients' survival from LinkedOmics, GEO, TCGA and Human Protein Atlas. We analyzed PPI, GO and KEGG pathways. GSEA was analyzed for functional comparison. The current drugs targeting ABL1 were statistically analyzed using DRUGSURV and DGIdb database. We found ABL1 is overexpressed in HCC and its higher expression reduces survival probability. Genetic changes of ABL1 are not frequent. We screened out 25 differentially expressed genes correlated with ABL1. The top functions of ABL1 are biological regulation, metabolic process, protein-containing, and protein binding. KEGG pathways showed that ABL1 and correlated with ABL1 significantly genes markedly enriched in the ErbB signaling pathway, and pathways in cancer. We counted the existing drugs targeting ABL1, which indicates that inhibiting ABL1 expression may improve the survival probability of HCC. In conclusion, ABL1 plays a crucial role in the development and progression of this cancerization and is a potential drug target."
