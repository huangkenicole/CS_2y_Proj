        "The association between venous thrombosis and cancer has been known for a long time. Thrombophlebitis often occurs during the course of a known cancer, but sometimes constitutes the presenting sign. Based on a series of 10 cases of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) revealing an underlying cancer, the authors analyse the various aspects of this association and the elements which help to guide the diagnosis towards a cancer. A simple assessment comprising clinical examination, full blood count and differential white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, protein electrophoresis, chest x-ray and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was performed on admission in 75 cases of presumably idiopathic DVT and revealed a cancer in 10 cases: 6 women and 4 men with a mean age of 53 years. Cancers were located in the urogenital tract in 5 cases, in the bronchi in 2 cases, in the stomach in one case, and there was one case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and another case of liposarcoma of the left iliac fossa. The histological type most frequently encountered was adenocarcinoma in 6 cases. In 9 out of 10 cases, the cancer was discovered at the stage of metastases. However, a localized cancer was detected in one case, in which surgical treatment allowed cure of the patient. Comparison of the various characteristics of DVT between the group of DVT revealing a cancer and the group of DVT which remained idiopathic did not reveal any statistically significant difference. A simple, inexpensive assessment looking for a cancer must be systematically performed in all cases of idiopathic DVT in patients between the ages of 50 and 85 years. Other more elaborate examinations may be requested on the basis of the results of the preliminary assessment."
