        "To observe the expression of differentiation inhibiting factor 1 (DIF1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and explore the relation between them and microvessel density (MVD) in gastric cancer tissue.",
        "The expression of DIF1, VEGF, CD34 and MVD in gastric cancer and peri-cancerous tissues was qualitatively analyzed with immunohistochemistry. The protein expression of DIF1 and VEGF in gastric cancer and peri-cancerous tissue was semi-quantitatively analyzed with Western blot.",
        "The expression of DIF1 and VEGF, and MVD were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in peri-cancerous tissue (p<0.05). MVD was significantly higher in DIF-positive gastric cancer tissue than in DIF-negative gastric cancer tissue (p<0.001).",
        "In gastric cancer, DIF1 expression is related to VEGF expression and MVD. DIF1 may promote angiogenesis in gastric cancer."
