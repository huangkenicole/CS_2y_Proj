        "The aim was to evaluate factor XIII activity (FXIIIa) and monocyte-derived microparticles (MDMPs) in cancer patients.",
        "In total, 138 cancer patients (31 malignant lymphomas, 39 multiple myelomas, and 68 lung cancers) were analyzed. We measured various biomarkers including FXIIIa and MDMPs.",
        "The values of endothelial activation markers, monocyte chemoattractant peptide (MCP)-1, soluble (s)CD14, and MDMPs were higher in cancer patients than in non-cancerous controls. MCP-1, sCD14, and MDMPs were significantly correlated with FXIIIa in multivariate analysis in cancer patients. In addition, MCP-1, sCD14, and MDMP levels were significantly increased in the high\u00a0FXIIIa group of patients. Finally, the survival rate of the high\u00a0FXIIIa group was significantly poor in the Kaplan-Meier analysis.",
        "These results suggest that abnormal levels of FXIIIa and MDMPs may offer promise as poor prognostic factors in cancer patients."
