        "Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases in humans and most common cause of death in twenty-first century. New cancer therapies are urgently required because of the existing pharmacological side effects of the conventional chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Newer modalities such as cancer vaccines and biological therapies are proving very helpful in the treatment of cancer along with the conventional therapies. The success of these novel cancer therapies is attributed to their lesser toxicity and the specific killing of the cancer cells. Bacterial therapy for cancer has been recognized a century ago. Live, attenuated, or genetically modified obligate or facultative anaerobic bacterial species exhibit the inherent property of colonizing the tumors and are capable of multiplying selectively inside the tumors, thereby inhibiting cancerous growths. The bacteria and their spores are used in the target specific therapies, delivering the prodrugs and the various proteins to the tumors. Albeit bacterial treatment of cancer is providing new perspective in the treatment of disease, the use of microorganisms to target tumors has certain confinements. The biosafety, genetic instability and the confounded interaction of the bacteria with treatment drugs, requires the more noteworthy consideration regarding the use of this novel treatment in the cancer treatment."
