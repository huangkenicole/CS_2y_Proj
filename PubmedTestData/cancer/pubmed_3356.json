        "Retrospective study of 189 cases of ovarian cancer admitted in our hospital from Jan, 1987 to Dec, 1997. All of these cases had postoperative pathological diagnosis.",
        "Of 31 recurrent cases, 19 cases had first cytoreductive surgery in our hospital, while other 12 cases were done in other hospitals. According to FIGO criteria, stage I, II 4 cases (12.9%), III, IV 27 cases (87.1%). The mean recurrent time of no-residual disease was 17.2 months, while that of residual disease < or = 2 cm was 10.1 months (P < 0.01). The mean recurrent time of those having chemotherapy > or = 6 cycles was 13.1 months, while that of those having chemotherapy < 6 cycles was 10.1 months (P > 0.05). The five-year survival rate of 18 cases having secondary cytoreductive surgery was 27.3%, while that of 4 cases having chemotherapy only was 7.1% (P < 0.01). The five-year survival rate of 7 cases abandoning any therapy was 4.8% (P < 0.01). 2 cases had only irradiation therapy.",
        "Histology, stage, degree of tumor differentiation, chemotherapy and the residual disease of cytoreductive surgery all influence recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer. Secondary cytoreductive surgery along with chemotherapy can raise recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer's five-year survival rate."
