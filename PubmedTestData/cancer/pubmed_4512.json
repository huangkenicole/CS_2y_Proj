        "Ginseng is commonly used as an herbal medicine for improvement of life quality. It is also used as a supplemental medication with anti-cancer drugs to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and shows some beneficial effects. Ginsenosides, also known as saponins, are the major active pharmacological compounds found in ginseng and have been extensively using in treatment of not only cancers but also the other inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, acute lung injury, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases. The anti-cancer activities of ginsengs and ginsenosides in different types of cancers have been well studied experimentally and clinically. The major anti-cancer mechanisms of ginseng compounds include inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis as well as induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Herein, we review and summarize the current knowledge on the pharmacological effects of ginsengs and ginseng-derived compounds in the treatment of cancers. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which ginsengs and ginsenosides modulate the immune response in cancer diseases as well as ginsengs-drugs interaction are also discussed."
