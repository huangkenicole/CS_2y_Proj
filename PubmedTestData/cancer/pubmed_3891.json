        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play indispensable roles in mediating regulation of epigenetics, and their dysregulation is strongly associated with the initiation and progression of human cancers. Recently, lncRNA bladder cancer-associated transcript 1 (BLACAT1) has been observed to exert oncogenic effects on cancers, including glioma, breast cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and osteosarcoma. Additional mechanical analyses have uncovered that lncRNA BLACAT1 is positively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis of primary tumors via involvement with various cellular activities, thus leading to poor overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS). In this review, we generalize the oncogenic roles of BLACAT1 in multiple human cancers through correlation with clinical implications and cellular activities. Moreover, we forecast its potential clinical application as a novel biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for cancers."
