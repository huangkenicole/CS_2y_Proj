        "Stem cell therapy consisted in the use of cells to treat damaged tissue, especially in cancer cases. Several cancer treatment techniques are developed today. However, the effectiveness of the treatments as well as the results remain too limited. We will discuss in this work the main advantages of the use of several categories of cells in the treatment of various cancerous diseases. The analysis of the obtained results related to cell therapy across the world over a period of twenty years can help to orient the researchers to the objectives in a more relevant and more reliable manner. The complex challenges of funded cancer care are discussed to provide a clear perspective on the future of administration and current treatment methods."
