        "Proteins of avian egg albumin have been suggested to play various biological roles during the development of chick embryo to confer protection. Recently, we have shown that ovotransferrin (OTf), the second major protein in egg albumin, undergoes thiol-linked autocleavage at distinct sites upon reduction. This study explores the physiological significance of OTf autocleavage by examining the effect of the reduced autocleaved OTf (termed rac-OTf) on modulation of cell proliferation, lethality, and apoptosis in two human cancer cell lines, colon cancer (HCT-116) and breast cancer (MCF-7). The rac-OTf was prepared by reduction of OTf with a non-thiol reductant (TCEP), to avoid reductive alkylation and produce highly soluble fragments. Unlike OTf, rac-OTf remarkably inhibited the proliferation of cancerous MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effect on HCT-116, but had no effect on normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Cytofluorometric and trypan blue exclusion analyses indicated that rac-OTf exhibits cytotoxicity to HCT-116 in a dose-dependent fashion. The cytotoxic mechanism of rac-OTf against cancer cells was found to be induction of apoptosis as judged by changes in cell morphology, annexin-V binding, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-9 and -6 activation, indicating the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. This finding is the first to describe the reduction-dependent autocleaved OTf as an anticancer molecule, providing insights into a novel physiological function of OTf, suggesting its therapeutic potential in the treatment of human cancers and health benefit in nutraceuticals."
