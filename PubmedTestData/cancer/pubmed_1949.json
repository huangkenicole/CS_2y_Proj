      "AbstractText": [
        "Although cancer can be cured if detected early and treated effectively, it is still a leading cause of death worldwide. Tumor development can be limited by an appropiate immune response, but it can be promoted by chronic extensive inflammation through metabolic dysregulation and angiogenesis. In the past decade, numerous efforts have been made in order to identify novel candidates with predictive values in cancer diagnostics. In line with this, researchers have investigated the involvement of pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) in cellular proliferation and immune escape in various types of cancers, although it has not been clearly elucidated. PTX-3 is a member of the long pentraxin subfamily which plays an important role in regulating inflammation, innate immunity response, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Increased synthesis of inflammatory biomarkers and activation of different cellular mechanisms can induce PTX-3 expression in various types of cells (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, myeloid dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells). PTX-3 has both pro- and anti-tumor functions, thus dual functions in oncogenesis. This review elucidates the potential usefulness of PTX-3 as a serum biomarker in cancer. While future investigations are needed, PTX-3 is emerging as a promising tool for cancer's diagnosis and prognosis, and also treatment monitoring."
