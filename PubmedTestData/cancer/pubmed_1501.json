        "A goal the authors always pursue is to realize diagnosis of precancer in vivo, real-time and non-invasive. In the present paper, results of diagnosis of certain cancer were obtained by pathological analysis of several samples, and then the visible light reflectance spectrum property of cancerous tissue was acquired by the comparison with the reflectance spectrum of normal tissue in the same organ. It was found that the main result of change in the reflectance spectrum was caused by the increases in hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The cancerous tissue has a lower reflectance in visible spectrum and has the strongest change in the absorption at 630 nm. Absorption peaks in the reflectance spectrum indicated that there are abundant of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the cancerous tissue. It is the same characteristics as in the cancerous tissue. It was fully indicated experimentally that visible light reflectance spectrum can distinguish normal and cancerous tissue."
