        "Multiple primary tumors are not rare: they are encountered in 3-5% of malignant tumors. They are particularly frequent in the head and neck [20]. They are most often met with secondary malignant tumors; triple tumors occur in only 0.5%, quadruple tumors in 0.3% of malignant tumors. The possibility of developing a second metachronous cancer 5 years after undergoing treatment of the initial head and neck cancer is approximately 22%. Multiple metachronous tumors often appear 3-4 years after the observation of the primary tumor, or even after 5-10 years in the case of laryngeal tumors. The frequency of multiple primary tumors in the head and neck region supports the \"field cancerization\" theory, according to which the inducing agents (primarily smoking and alcohol consumption) can initiate the tumorous degeneration at a number of sites in the oropharyngeal region. The authors report on a case in whom surgery for bladder tumor was followed 101 months later by tumor development in the region of the head and neck: 3 such tumors were treated within a period of 21 months. The histologic result on the bladder tumor was transitiocellular carcinoma, while the latter ones were squamous cell carcinomas. Three of the tumors were treated effectively (no local recurrence or metastasis developed), but the fourth led to the death of the patient. The literature on multiple tumors of the head and neck is reviewed, and possible etiologic factors are discussed. It is pointed out that, besides primary and secondary prevention, close observation of these patients is required, repeated panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract and genetic examinations are recommended."
