        "Cancer remains a major and leading health problem worldwide. Lack of early diagnosis, chemoresistance, and recurrence of cancer means vast research and development are required in this area. The complexity of the tumor microenvironment in the biological milieu poses greater challenges in having safer, selective, and targeted therapies. Existing strategies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapies moderately improve progression-free survival; however, they come with side effects that reduce quality of life. Thus, targeting potential candidates in the microenvironment, such as extracellular cathepsin D (CathD) which has been known to play major pro-tumorigenic roles in breast and ovarian cancers, could be a breakthrough in cancer treatment, specially using novel treatment modalities such as immunotherapy and nanotechnology-based therapy. This chapter discusses CathD as a pro-cancerous, more specifically a proangiogenic factor, that acts bi-functionally in the tumor microenvironment, and possible ways of targeting the protein therapeutically."
