        "Men have greater incidence and mortality rates than women for bladder cancer. Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas.",
        "To determine the epidemiologic features of urinary bladder cancer cases presenting at a cancer hospital, from Dec. 1994 through Dec. 2004.",
        "Six-hundred and seven medical records were evaluated retrospectively at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. Gender, age, histologic types, grade, stage, symptoms, risk factors, and patient follow-up were studied. Staging was done through the American Joint Commission on Cancer's criteria. Class of Case was established using the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards, 2004.",
        "Mean age: 55.5 years; men: 83%. Transitional cell- in 86%, squamous cell- in 4%, adeno- in 3%, and undifferentiated carcinoma in 7% of the cases. Stage: II in 18.3%, I in 17.3%, III in 14.2%, IV in 26%, 0 in 6.3%, and not evaluable in 17.8% of the cases. Grades: G3 in 37.9%, G2 in 25.2%, G1 in 9.7%, G4 in 2.8%, and undetermined in 24.4% of the subjects. Commonest presenting symptom: hematuria in 54.7% men and 52.9% women; risk factor: positive smoking history in nearly 35% males and 2% females. Average interval between diagnosis and last contact: 26.5 months; for analytic cases, 34.9 months.",
        "Urinary bladder cancer was seen primarily in males; transitional cell type was dominant. The majority of the patients were symptomatic; smoking history was recorded mostly in men. Further, improving in staging could be useful in addressing the concerns about data reproducibility over time and use for surveillance purposes."
