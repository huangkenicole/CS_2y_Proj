        "To assess the value of DNA ploidy, flow cytometric analysis was performed on unfixed fresh materials obtained from 86 patients with gastric cancer who underwent stomach resection. We evaluated the DNA content of gastric carcinoma cells from four different sites and compared it with Ki-67 proliferating activity, and other pathologic parameters. The incidence of aneuploid and diploid was similar (48.8% vs. 51.1%). Early gastric carcinoma showed a higher rate of the diploid pattern (75%) compared to that of advanced gastric carcinoma (47.3%). DNA diploidy was noted increasingly in diffuse-type tumors according to Lauren, in signet ring cell type tumor according to WHO classification and in poorly differentiated tumors (p<0.05). Well and moderately differentiated carcinomas revealed the aneuploid pattern more frequently than poorly differentiated tumors. The aneuploidy was associated with high S phase fraction and high proliferative index. Aneuploidy was noted in the mucosa adjacent to the tumor (26%), in the close normal-looking mucosa (7%) and in the remote normal-looking mucosa (3%). This result suggest the possible role of field cancerization in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma."
