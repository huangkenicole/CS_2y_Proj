      "AbstractText": [
        "Accumulating studies have revealed that microRNA (miR)-93 may exert an oncogenic role in various cancers via inhibiting CDKN1A. However, the involvement of miR-93/CDKN1A axis in cervical cancer remains unclear. We aimed to investigate expression pattern, clinical significance and potential functions of miR-93/CDKN1A axis in cervical cancer.",
        "Expression levels of miR-93 and CDKN1A mRNA in 100 pairs of cervical cancer and matched non-cancerous tissue samples were detected by quantitative-PCR. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations of miR-93 and/or CDKN1A expression with various clinicopathologic features and patients' prognosis. The functions of miR-93/CDKN1A axis on cell proliferation and invasion were also examined.",
        "Compared to non-cancerous tissues, the expression levels of miR-93 and CDKN1A were dramatically increased and decreased in cervical cancer tissues, respectively (both P\u202f<\u202f0.01). High miR-93 and/or low CDKN1A expression were significantly associated with advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, the presence of lymph node metastasis and recurrence (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Importantly, patients with high miR-93 and/or low CDKN1A expression had shorter overall survival than those with low miR-93 and/or high CDKN1A expression. The multivariate analysis identified miR-93 and/or CDKN1A expression as independent prognostic factors of cervical cancer. Functionally, miR-93 promoted cell proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells via inhibiting CDKN1A.",
        "miR-93 upregulation and CDKN1A downregulation may be both associated with the development, progression and patients' prognosis of cervical cancer. miR-93/CDKN1A axis may also play an important role in the malignancy of cervical cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for this cancer."
