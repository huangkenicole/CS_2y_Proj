        "ABC and immunohistochemical methods were used to compare the location of 8 lectin receptors (LRS) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 100 cancerous and 56 non-cancerous tissues of the human breast. The results showed that the positive rates of peanutagglutinin (PNA) in the normal breast tissues, benign lesions and breast cancers were 38.1%, 37.1% and 73.7%, respectively (P < 0.005). The positive rates of Bardeiraea simpoicifolia receptors (BSL) in these 3 tissues were 14.3%, 17.1% and 75% (P < 0.005). The positive rates of CEA in these 3 tissues were 42.86%, 51.43% and 78.13% (P < 0.005). Analysis of the differences among the positive rates in cancerous tissues, normal breast tissue and non-cancerous tissues showed that CEA was not superior to BSL or PNA in its specificity in detecting breast cancers. Comparing the location of LRSs in the CEA positive specimens, we had discovered obvious differences in BSL and WGA in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues of the human breast. This implies that there may be a subtype CEA which is highly specific for breast cancers."
