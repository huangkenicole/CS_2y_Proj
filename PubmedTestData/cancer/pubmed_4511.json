      "AbstractText": [
        "Breast cancer (BC) is primarily triggered by estrogens, especially 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), which are synthesized by the aromatase enzyme. While all steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis is mediated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Herein, we demonstrate that <i>StAR</i> mRNA expression was aberrantly high in human hormone-dependent BC (MCF7, MDA-MB-361, and T-47D), modest in hormone-independent triple negative BC (TNBC; MDA-MB-468, BT-549, and MDA-MB-231), and had little to none in non-cancerous mammary epithelial (HMEC, MCF10A, and MCF12F) cells. In contrast, these cell lines showed abundant expression of aromatase (<i>CYP19A1</i>) mRNA. Immunofluorescence displayed qualitatively similar patterns of both StAR and aromatase expression in various breast cells. Additionally, three different transgenic (Tg) mouse models of spontaneous breast tumors, i.e., MMTV-Neu, MMTV-HRAS, and MMTV-PyMT, demonstrated markedly higher expression of StAR mRNA/protein in breast tumors than in normal mammary tissue. While breast tumors in these mouse models exhibited higher expression of <i>ER\u03b1</i>, <i>ER\u03b2</i>, and <i>PR</i> mRNAs, their levels were undetected in TNBC tumors. Accumulation of E2 in plasma and breast tissues, from MMTV-PyMT and non-cancerous Tg mice, correlated with StAR, but not with aromatase, signifying the importance of StAR in governing E2 biosynthesis in mammary tissue. Treatment with a variety of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) in primary cultures of enriched breast tumor epithelial cells, from MMTV-PyMT mice, resulted in suppression of StAR and E2 levels. Importantly, inhibition of StAR, concomitant with E2 synthesis, by various HDACIs, at clinical and preclinical doses, in MCF7 cells, indicated therapeutic relevance of StAR in hormone-dependent BCs. These findings provide insights into the molecular events underlying the differential expression of StAR in human and mouse cancerous and non-cancerous breast cells/tissues, highlighting StAR could serve not only as a novel diagnostic maker but also as a therapeutic target for the most prevalent hormone-sensitive BCs."
