        "Much progress has been made in introducing immunological treatment approaches for cancer, with lessons learned from both the successes and failures of immunotherapy. Among the challenges of immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer are the multitudes of mechanisms by which cancers are known to subvert the immune defenses. This has led to the incorporation into the immunotherapeutic arsenal strategies by which to overcome the cancer's immunological blockades. What has been only superficially explored is the immunological milieu of premalignant lesions and the possibility of immunological approaches for the treatment of premalignant lesions so as to prevent secondary premalignant lesions and their progression to cancer. This review discusses the immunological environment associated with premalignant lesions, and the possible missed opportunity of utilizing immunological treatment strategies in the less hostile environment of premalignant lesions as compared to the immune subversive cancer environment."
