        "We examined the localization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 185 specimens of primary human gastric cancer using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemical method on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Thirty-four per cent of the gastric cancer specimens were positive for EGF, which was mainly located in the cytoplasm of the cancer cells and occasionally in the stromal cells, but was not detected in non-cancerous gastric epithelium. Moreover, the presence of EGF in gastric cancer was correlated with gastric wall invasion and lymph node metastasis. EGF was found more often in advanced cancers than in early ones (p less than 0.01), and also more often in cancers with lymph node metastasis than in those without (p less than 0.05). The five-year survival of patients with EGF-positive tumors was worse than that of patients with EGF-negative tumors (p less than 0.05). The presence of EGF in human gastric cancer may thus represent higher malignant potential."
