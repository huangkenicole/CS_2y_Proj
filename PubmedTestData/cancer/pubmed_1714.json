        "There is a higher incidence of colorectal cancer in young African-American patients compared with white Americans. This study examines the incidence, demographic pattern, and distribution of neoplastic lesions identified by flexible sigmoidoscopy in an African-American population. A sample of charts was reviewed from an urban gastroenterology practice that serves predominantly African Americans. A total of 455 patients were found who underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy. The sample included 391 symptomatic patients and 64 asymptomatic patients. Two hundred fifty-five patients were < 50 years old and 200 patients were > or = 50 years. More neoplastic lesions were found among older patients (21 patients: 14 with polyps and 7 cancers) than among younger patients (7 patients: 3 with polyps and 4 cancers); the difference of all positive findings between the two groups was significant. However, the cancerous rate for younger patients was not statistically different from that for older patients. These findings suggest that young African-American patients with colorectal symptoms should undergo aggressive approaches to detect cancer early."
