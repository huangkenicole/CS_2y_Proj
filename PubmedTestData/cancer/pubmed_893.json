        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. miRNA-3652, though relatively less explored, has recently emerged as a potential key player in ovarian cancer's molecular landscape. This review aims to delineate the functional significance and tumor progression role of miRNA-3652 in ovarian cancer, shedding light on its potential as both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. A comprehensive literature search was carried out using established databases, the focus was on articles that reported the role of miRNA-3652 in ovarian cancer, encompassing mechanistic insights, functional studies, and its association with clinical outcomes. This updated review highlighted that miRNA-3652 is intricately involved in ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, its dysregulation was linked to altered expression of critical genes involved in tumor growth and metastasis; furthermore, miRNA-3652 expression levels were found to correlate with clinical stages, prognosis, and response to therapy in ovarian cancer patients. miRNA-3652 holds significant promise as a vital molecular player in ovarian cancer's pathophysiology. Its functional role and impact on tumor progression make it a potential candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in ovarian cancer. Given the pivotal role of miRNA-3652 in ovarian cancer, future studies should emphasize in-depth mechanistic explorations, utilizing advanced genomic and proteomic tools. Collaboration between basic scientists and clinicians will be vital to translating these findings into innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, ultimately benefiting ovarian cancer patients.
