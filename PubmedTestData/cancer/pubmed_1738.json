      "AbstractText": [
        "The endogenous molecular biology of cancer cells involves autocrine and paracrine secretion of insulin and insulin-like growth-factors I and II, which subserve energy production and growth stimulation, respectively, in these cells. These activities confer on cancer its malignant potential, working as they do autonomously, free from higher levels of integrated control. Taking advantage of cancer's mechanisms of malignancy by employing exogenous insulin as a biologic response modifier, it is possible to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents for improved treatment of cancer. A synergy between certain membrane and metabolic effects of insulin on cancer cell molecular biology increases anticancer drug efficacy, and it does so with reduced doses of the drugs, enhancing their safety. This treatment strategy has been applied abroad over the last five decades with very promising clinical results."
