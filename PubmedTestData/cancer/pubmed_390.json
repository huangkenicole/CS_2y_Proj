      "AbstractText": [
        "The fibroblastic growth factor (FGF)-2 has been shown to induce angiogenesis in several tumor types. To date, the activity of FGF during the development of oral pre-cancerous lesions has not been analyzed. We herein evaluated the role of FGF-2 in the pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions in the hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model.",
        "Expression of FGF-2 and its receptors FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 was assessed by immunohistochemistry at different stages of the carcinogenesis protocol. Activity of FGF-2 isoforms was analyzed by Western blots.",
        "Increase and abnormal localization of FGF-2 expression was evident in cancerized epithelium before it was possible to detect morphologic alterations. The changes in FGF-2 are concomitant with the evolution of subepithelial fibrosis. Immunolabeling of carcinomas was faint or completely negative. Increases of FGF-2 activity are mainly due to the increase in the 18 kDa isoform. Receptors 2 and 3 of FGF are present in epithelium, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelia of control samples and in all stages of malignant transformation.",
        "Our results would suggest a role for FGF-2 in the epithelium-connective interactions and a deregulation of its expression in the early stages of oral cancerization. In pre-cancerous tissue FGF-2 would play a central role in the development of fibrosis and a more collateral role in the induction of angiogenesis. The data would indicate its involvement in the process via the 18 kDa isoform."
