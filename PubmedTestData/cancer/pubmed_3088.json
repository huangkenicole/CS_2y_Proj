        "To determine the efficacy of PHOTOFRIN-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of diffuse \"field cancerization\" of the oral cavity and Cis-T2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma (SqCCa) of the larynx in patients not amenable or that have failed conventional head and neck treatment.",
        "Over the past 15 years 10 patients with early stage Tis-T2N0M0 SqCCa of the oral cavity and oropharynx and 10 patients with Tis-T2N0M0 SqCCa of the larynx were treated. Intravenous PHOTOFRIN (porfimer sodium) (dose 2.0 mg/kg) was administered outpatient, followed 48-60 hours later by intraoperative light photoactivation at 630 nm via fiberoptic microlens (ML) delivery (surgical light dose, 50-100 J/cm(2)) and/or cylindrical diffuser (CD) delivery (80-100 J/cm).",
        "Complete responses (CRs) (follow up 6 months-9 years) were achieved in eight of 10 patients with diffuse field cancerization of the oral cavity. CRs (follow up 6 months-8 years) were achieved in eight of 10 patients with superficial laryngeal cancer obviating the need for total laryngectomy in previously treated radiation therapy patients.",
        "PHOTOFRIN-mediated PDT provides a surgical oncologic modality for potentially curative treatment of early stage oral cavity and laryngeal malignancies with minimal side effects, absence of systemic toxicity, preservation of oral function and voice quality, with multiple drug administration, and laser light retreatment capability."
