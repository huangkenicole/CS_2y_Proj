        "Cancer is a global health problem and the continuous rise in incidence and mortality due to cancer carries a real economic burden to all countries. Accumulation of genetic mutation, exposure of environmental carcinogens and food habits due to change in lifestyles are the key reasons for cancer. Targeting cancer cells, we need a multitargeting molecule with low/no toxicity.",
        "To review the current update of the research status of chemopreventive/therapeutic molecule, Apigenin.",
        "Compare the results of the published articles and granted patents on this compound. We also discuss the pros and cons of the present research and future direction.",
        "Cancer cells have characteristic alterations and dysregulation of various cell signaling pathways that control cell homeostasis, proliferation, motility, and survival in normal cells. Natural flavonoids are the compounds well known for their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancerous properties. Apigenin, along with several other physiological effects, has a very low intrinsic toxicity and striking effects on the proliferation of cancer cells. Interestingly, this multitargeting molecule is getting wide acceptance among researchers. It is evident from the recent patents filed in this compound. At present, three patents have been granted only on the anticancer properties of apigenin.",
        "This mini-review will explain the present research status of apigenin and will further shine some light on how apigenin performs its anti-cancerous actions by interfering with the key cellsignaling pathways."
