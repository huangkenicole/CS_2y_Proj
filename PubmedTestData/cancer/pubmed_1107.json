        "Endoscopic laser treatment was initially applied for gastrointestinal bleeding, but has been actively extended, especially in Japan, to the curative treatment of early upper gastrointestinal cancers. We have treated 10 cases of early gastric cancer and 1 case of early esophageal cancer by Nd-YAG laser radiation, and 2 cases of early gastric cancer by photochemical therapy (PCT) with argon laser + hematoporphyrin derivative. Also, 62 cases of advanced cancer were treated, 10 of the esophagus and 52 of the stomach, for bleeding (18 cases) or stenosis (34 cases). The cases were nonresectable or they were patients who refused surgery. Satisfactory results were obtained by treatment with YAG laser, but have not yet been obtained with PCT. In order to find indications for the possible extension of endoscopic laser therapy to operable cases of early gastric cancer, we studied lymph node metastases in 200 cases of early gastric cancer surgically treated by us. It was found that early gastric cancers (both mucosal and submucosal) measuring less than 2 cm in diameter, of type I, IIa, and IIc (without ulcer scar), had no lymph node metastases and such cases can be treated by local therapy--such as endoscopic laser therapy. In palliative endoscopic laser therapy for complications of advanced gastrointestinal cancers, there are no major problems with active performance. We obtained a high (90%) hemostatic rate in bleeding cases of upper gastrointestinal cancer and a satisfactory (65%) rate of dilating effect in cases of cancerous stenosis at the esophagus and cardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
