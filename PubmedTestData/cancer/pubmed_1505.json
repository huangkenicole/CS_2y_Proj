        "Resistance to steroid hormones presents a serious problem with respect to their mass use in therapy. It may be caused genetically by mutation of genes involved in hormonal signaling, not only steroid receptors, but also other players in the signaling cascade as co-regulators and other nuclear factors, mediating the hormone-born signal. Another possibility is acquired resistance which may develop under long-term steroid treatment, of which a particular case is down regulation of the receptors. In the review recent knowledge is summarized on the mechanism of main steroid hormone action, pointing to already proven or potential sites causing steroid resistance. We have attempted to address following questions: 1) What does stay behind differences among patients as to their response to the (anti)steroid treatment? 2) Why do various tissues/cells respond differently to the same steroid hormone though they contain the same receptors? 3) Are such differences genetically dependent? The main attention was devoted to glucocorticoids as the most frequently used steroid therapeutics. Further, androgen insensitivity is discussed with a particular attention to acquired resistance to androgen deprivation therapy of prostate cancer. Finally the potential causes are outlined of breast and related cancer(s) resistance to antiestrogen therapy."
