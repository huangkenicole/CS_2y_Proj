        "This is a review regarding different types of cancer treatments. We aimed at analyzing the tumor microenvironment and the recent trends for the therapeutic applications and effectiveness for several kinds of cancers. Traditionally the cancer treatment was based on the neoplastic cells. Methods such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, which were targeted on the highly proliferating mutated tumor cells, have been investigated. The tumor microenvironment describes the non-cancerous cells in the tumor and has enabled to investigate the behavior and response of the cancer cells to a treatment process; it consists in a tissue that may have a predictive significance for tumor behavior and response to therapy. These include fibroblasts, immune cells and cells that comprise the blood vessels. It also includes the proteins produced by all of the cells present in the tumor that support the growth of the cancer cells. By monitoring changes in the tumor microenvironment using its molecular and cellular profiles as the tumor progresses will be vital for identifying cell or protein targets for the cancer prevention and its therapeutic purposes."
