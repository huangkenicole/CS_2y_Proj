        "Metastatic cancer is usually an incurable disease. Cancers have a broad repertoire of subversive tactics to defeat the immune system. They mimic self, they down-regulate MHC molecules so that T cells are blind to their presence, they interfere with antigen presentation, and they produce factors that can kill T cells or paralyze their response to antigens. Furthermore, the same powerful machinery designed to prevent harmful autoimmune responses is also acting to protect cancers. In particular, cancer is protected with the help of so-called regulatory immune cells. These unique subsets of cells, represented by almost every immune cell type, function to control responses of effector immune cells. In this review, we will discuss the evidence that cancer actively promotes cross-talk of regulatory immune cells to evade immunosurveillance. We will also discuss the role of a newly described cell type, regulatory B cells, by emphasizing their importance in suppression of antitumor immune responses. Thus, cancer not only directly suppresses immune function, but also recruits components of the immune system to become traitors and protect the tumor from immune attack."
