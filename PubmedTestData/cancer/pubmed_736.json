        "The human genome encodes for 11 papain-like endolysosomal cysteine peptidases, collectively known as the cysteine cathepsins. Based on their biochemical properties and with the help of experiments in cell culture, the cysteine cathepsins have acquired a reputation as promotors of progression and metastasis of various cancer entities. However, tumors are known to be complex tissues in which non-cancerous cells are also critical for tumorigenesis. Here we discuss the results of the intense investigation of cathepsins in mouse models of human cancers. We focus on models in immunocompetent mice, because only such models allow for analysis of cathepsins in a fully functional tumor microenvironment. An important outcome of those studies was the identification of cancer-promoting cathepsins in tumor-associated macrophages. Another interesting outcome of these animal studies was the identification of a homeostatic tumor-suppressive role for cathepsin L in skin and intestinal cancers. Taken together, these in vivo findings provide a basis for the use of cysteine cathepsins as therapeutic targets, prodrug activators, or as proteases for imaging tumors."
