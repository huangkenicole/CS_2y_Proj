        "Exercise and physical activity have been shown to reduce the risk of many common cancers and strongly influence tumor biology. A cause-effect mechanism explaining this relationship is dependent on cellular pathways that can influence tumor growth and are exercise responsive. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is reported to promote the development and progression of carcinomas through cellular signaling in cancerous tissues. This review summarizes the physiologic basis of the role of the IGF axis in oncology and the influence of exercise on this process. We examined the effects of exercise prescription on the IGF axis in cancer survivors by evaluating the current scope of the literature. The current research demonstrates a remarkable heterogeneity and inconsistency in the responses of the IGF axis to exercise in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors. Finally, this review presents an in-depth exploration of the physiologic basis and mechanistic underpinnings of the seemingly disparate relationship between exercise and the IGF axis in oncology. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to categorize the effects of exercise prescription on the IGF axis in cancer survivors, the inconsistency of results suggests a multifaceted relationship, the complexities of which are considered in this review."
