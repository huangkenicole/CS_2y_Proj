        "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in children. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 13 patients with pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor between October 2009 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed, including 9 boys and 4 girls aged 1 to 12 years 4 months (mean 4 years 9 months). Seven patients underwent total tumor resection, 4 had lobectomy, 1 had partial tumor resection and 1 had biopsy. The follow-up time ranged from 2 months to 6 years and 2 months. <b>Results:</b> Among the 13 patients, 9 were cured. Two patients lived with tumor. One of them had tumor which shrinked gradually and the other had stable disease. One patient with multiple lesions encountered recurrence after 3 operations and developed suspicious hepatic metastasis. One died during the operation because of airway mismanagement. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in children has rather good prognosis while a few cases have the potential of recurrence and canceration. Surgery is the primary therapeutic approach. Close post-operative follow up is necessary."
