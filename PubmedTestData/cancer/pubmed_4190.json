        "BACKGROUND The transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) was found to be expressed abnormally in a variety of tumors and is associated with unfavorable prognosis in human cancers. However, its clinical significance in pancreatic cancer (PC) is mostly unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of TRPM8 in 110 pairs of PC tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The association of TRPM8 expression with the clinical characters of PC patients was analyzed using the chi-square test. Furthermore, the prognostic value of TRPM8 was determined with Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS We found that the expression level of TRPM8 was significantly elevated in PC tissues compared to the non-cancerous controls (P<0.001). In addition, a close relationship was observed between elevated TRPM8 expression with large tumor size (P=0.001), advanced TNM (P=0.013), and distant metastasis (P=0.034). Survival analysis suggested that patients with high TRPM8 expression has worse OS (P=0.001) and DFS (P<0.001) than those with low TRPM8 expression. Moreover, TRPM8 was confirmed as a valuable prognostic biomarker for OS (HR=1.913; 95% CI: 1.020-3.589; P=0.043) or DFS (HR=2.374; 95% CI: 1.269-4.443; P=0.007) of PC patients. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that TRPM8 expression is significantly up-regulated in PC and it might be a useful prognostic factor for patients with PC."
