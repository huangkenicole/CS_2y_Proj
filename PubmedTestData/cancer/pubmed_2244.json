        "Pain is one of the most feared symptoms of cancer. Bad pain not properly relieved contributes to the suffering of the patient and family. This may encourage them to seek additional complementary and alternative therapies, such as the one in our literature review. Reiki is understood as a healing method that uses universal energy to achieve balance and harmony of body, mind and soul, through the laying on of hands. Reiki is a relatively new the rapyin relation to the relief of the symptoms of cancer. In fact, there are still a few articles in this field. Currently, the authors explore the evidence on the effectiveness of Reiki in relation to cancer pain and symptom control. Due to the increased interest deposited in Reiki by the health professionals--especially for oncology professionals--to relieve the symptoms of cancer, there has been a synthesis of recent studies to provide the evidence so far. After our literature review, we can conclude that there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of Reiki in relieving the cancer's symptoms due to the small sample size used, the paucity of studies and the abandonment of the study participants and others."
