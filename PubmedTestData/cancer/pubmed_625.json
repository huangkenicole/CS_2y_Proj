        "The patient was an 81-year-old man. Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was performed for a sigmoid colon cancer(S, type 2, pT3[SS], INF a, Ly0, V0, BD1, Pn0, pPM0, pDM0, RM0, pN0, pM0, pStage \u2162a, R0, Cur A). One year after the surgery, a blood test showed CEA as high as 68.9 ng/mL, and an abdominal enhanced computed tomography revealed a hepatic tumor showing marginal contrast in the 4th liver segment. Positron emission tomography showed an accumulation of SUVmax 19.0 at the same site, and a metastatic liver tumor was diagnosed. A laparoscopic medial hepatectomy was performed. Bleeding from the hepatectomy site increased significantly after completion. Subcutaneous emphysema spreading from the face to the trunk and thigh was observed, and blood tests revealed a pH of 7.172, PaCO2 of 71.0 mmHg, lactate of 67 mg/dL, mixed acidosis, D-dimer of 118 \u03bcg/mL, and a disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC)syndrome was diagnosed. Following the difficulty of hemostasis, the surgery was changed to laparotomy and terminated by gauze packing. We encountered a case of acidosis exacerbated by hypercapnia that progressed to DIC during laparoscopic medial hepatectomy."
