        "The object of the present study was the ultrafast photodynamic processes of hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) for diagnosis and therapy of cancer. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra of cancerous and normal cells were measured using an ultrashort pulse laser spectral technique and picosecond time-correlated single-photon counting system. The fast part of cancerous and normal cells fluorescence decay was approximately 150 and 300 ps, the fluorescence peak intensity of cancerous and normal cells decayed about 10% and 55% in 12 hour, the lifetime of cancerous and normal cells was about 824 and 1 798 ps by calculating date of fluorescence decay, and HPD stay time was about 17 and 6 days in the cancerous and normal cells sample respectively. The data show that cancerous cells were greatly intimate with HPD. The results obtained can be used as an important basis for the diagnosis of cancer based on ultrashort pulse laser spectral technique. The results will contribute to feebleness ultrafast fluorescence of biology sample for real time measurement."
