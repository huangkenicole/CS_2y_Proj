        "Nowadays, the potential therapeutic role of various bioflavonoids including Curcumin, Luteolin and Resveratrol has currently been well-documented in a vast range of fatal complications including synaptic failure and cancers. These bioflavonoids are widely being implemented for the treatment of various cancers as they possess anti-cancerous, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, they are also used as a better alternative to conventional therapies since; these are non-toxic to cells and having no or least side effects. Notably, the pertinent therapeutic role of Rutin in cervical cancer is still unsettled however, its anti-cancerous role has already been reported in other cancers including prostate and colon cancer. Rutin (Vitamin P or Rutoside) is a polyphenolics flavonoid exhibiting multi-beneficial roles against several carcinomas.",
        "Despite the evidence for its several biological activities, the anticancer effects of Rutin on human cervical cancer (C33A) cells remain to be explored. In this study, the anticancer potential of Rutin was investigated by employing the key biomarkers such as nuclear condensation reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).",
        "Our findings showed that Rutin treatment reduced the cell viability, induced significant increase in ROS production and nuclear condensation in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Rutin provoked apoptosis by inducing decrease in MMP and activation of caspase-3. Cell cycle analysis further confirmed the efficacy of Rutin by showing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase.",
        "Thus, our study is envisaged to open up interests for elucidating Rutin as an anticancerous agent against cervical cancer."
