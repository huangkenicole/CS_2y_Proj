        "Immune effector and regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment are key factors in tumor development and progression as the pathogenesis of cancer vitally depends on the multifaceted interactions between various microenvironmental stimuli provided by tumor-associated immune cells. Immune regulatory cells participate in all stages of cancer development from the induction of genomic instability to the maintenance of intratumoral angiogenesis, proliferation and spreading of malignant cells, and formation of premetastatic niches in distal tissues. Dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment serve as a double-edged sword and, in addition to initiating potent anti-tumor immune responses, may mediate genomic damage, support neovascularization, block anti-tumor immunity and stimulate cancerous cell growth and spreading. Regulatory dendritic cells in cancer may directly and indirectly maintain antigen-specific and non-specific T cell unresponsiveness by controlling T cell polarization, MDSC and Treg differentiation and activity, and affecting specific microenvironmental conditions in premalignant niches. Understanding the mechanisms involved in regulatory dendritic cell polarization and operation and revealing pharmacological means for harnessing these pathways will provide additional opportunities for modifying the tumor microenvironment and improving the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches to cancer."
