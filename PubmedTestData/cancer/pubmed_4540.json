        "A 62-year-old man with synchronous multiple primary cancers involving the lung, stomach, and thyroid was admitted. Initially the patient's chest X-ray showed an abnormal shadow in the right middle-lobe indicating lung cancer. During preoperative examination, gastric cancer of the antrum and angle were detected. Excisional biopsy of the lymph node in the neck after chest surgery revealed thyroid cancer. A middle lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed for lung cancer and the histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT4N2M0, stage IIIB. Gastric cancer was treated by endoscopic mucosal resection. Considering the relatively better prognosis of papillary thyroid cancer, we concluded that no further treatment to the thyroid lesion was necessary. In Japan, according to autopsy reports, triple primary cancers are gradually increasing. During the periods 1994 to 1996, the incidence of triple cancers was 0.81% of all autopsy cases reported."
