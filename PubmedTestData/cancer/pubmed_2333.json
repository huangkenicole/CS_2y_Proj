        "Mounting evidence has shown that miR-23b-3p, which is associated with cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, acts as a biomarker for diagnosis and outcomes in numerous cancers. However, the clinicopathological implication of miR-23b-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma\u00a0(HCC) remains unclear. Our study evaluated the role of miR-23b-3p in HCC and investigated its potential application as a marker for preliminary diagnosis and therapy in HCC. High-throughput data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus\u00a0(GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas\u00a0(TCGA) were collected and analyzed. One hundred and one tissue sections of HCC were paired with adjacent non-cancerous HCC as further supplements. miR-23b-3p expression was detected using quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, the relationship between miR-23b-3p expression and HCC progression and Time-to-recurrence (months) was explored. Ten algorithms were applied to predict the prospective target genes of miR-23b-3p. Next, we conducted bioinformatics analysis for further study. miR-23b-3p expression was pronouncedly decreased in HCC tissues in contrast with their paired adjacent non-cancerous HCC (P<0.001) with RT-qPCR. In total, 405\u00a0targets, acquired with consistent prediction from at least five databases, were used for the bioinformatics analysis. According to the Gene Ontology\u00a0(GO) analysis, all targets were classified into biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. In the pathway analysis, targets of miR-23b-3p were primarily enriched in the signaling pathways of renal cell carcinoma, hepatitis\u00a0B and pancreatic cancer (corrected P-value\u00a0<0.05). In the protein-protein interaction\u00a0(PPI) network for miR-23b-3p, a total of 8 targets, including SRC, AKT1, EGFR, CTNNB1, BCL2, SMAD3, PTEN and KDM6A, were located in the key nodes with high degree (>35). In conclusion, this study provides impressive illumination of the potential role of miR-23b-3p in HCC tumorigenesis and progression. Furthermore, miR-23b-3p may act as a predictor of HCC and could be a new treatment target."
