        "Legume lectins are carbohydrate-binding protein and widely distributed in a variety of species of leguminous plants and have drawn increased attention toward cancer. Nowadays, the lectins have been studied for the screening of potential biomarkers which increased its importance in cancer research. Few plant lectins have been shown to destroy cancer cells, suggesting that lectins may have biological potential in cancer treatments. In this review, we present a focused outline of legume lectins in descriptive their complex anti-cancer mechanisms on the bases of their properties of recognition and interacting specifically with carbohydrates binding sites. Existing reports suggested the binding of lectins to cancerous cells with their cell surface markers speculated by histochemistry in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we illuminate the use of legume lectins as a natural source for diagnostics and therapeutics purpose against cancer."
