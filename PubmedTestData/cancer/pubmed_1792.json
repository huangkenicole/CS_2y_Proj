        "Viruses are the intracellular pathogens that reproduce only in the living cell and manipulate the cellular machinery to produce more viruses. Viral replications can affect cellular genes of the host in multiple cancerous ways. Approximately, 20% of all human oncogenesis is caused by cancer-causing viruses known as oncoviruses. Viral infection causes chronic inflammation leading to cell death, uncontrollable proliferation, and modulated expression of some of the regulatory proteins. Oncogenesis is a multistep phenomenon in which normal host cells are transformed into cancerous cells on the basis of host genetic variability. Oncogenic viruses encode genes that cause viral replication and transformation of the host cells to produce viral proteins and protein complexes. The phenomenon from basic viral infection to tumorigenesis is lengthy due to the involvement of factors like immunity complications, cellular mutations, and exposure to other cancerous agents. The viruses that are involved in human cancer development are Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), and Human T lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1). This review article summarizes advanced knowledge related to human oncogenic viruses and the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis in humans."
