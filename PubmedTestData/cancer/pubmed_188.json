      "AbstractText": [
        "The theory of field effect suggests that the tumor-adjacent area, besides histopathologically normal, undergoes genetic and epigenetic changes that can eventually affect epithelial homeostasis, predisposing the patient to cancer development. One of the many molecular changes described in cancer are microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulates the expression of important genes during carcinogenesis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the field effect in oral cancer.",
        "We investigated the differential expression profile of four miRNAs (hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-135b, and hsa-miR-29c) in cancerous oral tissue, in tumor-adjacent tissue and and in non-cancerous tissue samples from healthy volunteers.",
        "Our results showed significant overexpression profiles of all four studied miRNAs in cancerous oral tissue compared to non-cancerous samples, as well as in tumor-adjacent tissue compared to cancer-free tissue. No significant difference was found when comparing the expression profile of cancerous and tissue-adjacent tissue groups. We found a negative correlation between the expression of hsa-miR-21 expression and STAT3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",
        "These results suggest that the tissue adjacent to cancer cannot be considered a normal tissue because its molecular aspects are significantly altered. Our data corroborates the hypothesis of field cancerization."
