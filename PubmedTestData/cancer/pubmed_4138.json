        "Heat shock protein 90 beta was mainly located in the cell cytoplasma and weakly expressed in non-cancerous gastric mucosa. The expression rates of HSP90 beta in normal gastric mucosa, gastritis and paracancer tissues were 11.76%, 13.04% and 11.42% respectively, and there were no significant differences between them (P > 0.05). The expression of HSP90 beta was increased in gastric cancer. The positive rate of HSP90 beta in gastric cancer tissue was 30.00%, and was higher than non-cancerous gastric mucosa (P < 0.05). The expression rates of HSP90 beta in well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated gastric cancer and mucinous carcinoma were 15.38%, 31.25%, 33.33%, and 42.85% respectively. The expression of HSP90 beta in SGC7901/VCR of MDR-type gastric cell line was higher than in its parental cell line SGC7901. In situ hybridization showed that the positive signal of HSP90 beta was mainly located in the cell cytoplasma.",
        "The expression of HSP90 beta was higher in gastric cancer tissue than in non-cancerous gastric mucosa. In gastric cancer tissue, the expression of HSP90 beta was greater in poorly differentiated cancer tissue, and in SGC7901/VCR of MDR-type gastric cancer cell line the expression of HSP90 beta was higher than that in its parental cell line SGC7901."
