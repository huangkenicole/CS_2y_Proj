        "A prior study indicated that differences in the x-ray linear attenuation coefficients of cancerous and normal breast tissues tend to increase as the energy of the incident beam decreases. The authors investigated x-ray energies down to 20 keV. In the current study, the linear attenuation coefficients for normal and selected cancerous breast tissues within the energy range of 14 to 18 keV were determined.",
        "Fifty breast biopsy specimens consisting of a mixture of breast malignancies, normal tissues, fat specimens, and tumors grown in rats were used. X-ray linear attenuation coefficients were measured for each sample within the energy range of 14.15 to 18 keV, using monoenergetic x-rays from beamline X-19A at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Each sample was measured at 130 different energies starting at 14.15 keV with step sizes of 0.030 keV. Correlation of the measured attenuation coefficients for cellular makeup was performed.",
        "The mean of linear attenuation coefficients for samples classified as \"cancers\" was 10.9% higher than the mean of samples classified as \"normal\" breast tissues and was 66.5% higher than the mean of samples classified as normal breast fat.",
        "Differences in the linear attenuation coefficients of monochromatic x-rays between 14.15 and 18 keV do exist between normal and cancerous tissues, but there is some degree of overlap."
