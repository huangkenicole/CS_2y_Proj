        "The investigated data indicated that inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased mortality from different types of cancers. In the present study, biological samples (blood and scalp hair) of male subjects having lung and bladder cancers and non-cancerous subjects belonging to arsenic (As)-exposed area of southern parts of Pakistan were analysed for As contents. The As levels in drinking water of understudy area showed that sections of understudy population are exposed to arsenic concentrations, which was 3-15-fold higher than the permissible level (<10 \u03bcg/L). For comparative purposes the biological samples of matched male cancer patient, as referent patients belonging to big city (Hyderabad) who had used municipal treated water with low arsenic levels <10 \u03bcg/L, were also collected. The exposed cancer patients have 2-3-fold higher level of As in both biological samples compared to non-exposed case-matched cancerous male subjects. This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between arsenic-contaminated water, food and cigarette with different types of risks of cancer."
