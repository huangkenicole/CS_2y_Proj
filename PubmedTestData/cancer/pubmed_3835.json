        "Nine male patients with separate primary cancers of the esophagus and head and neck (pharynx, larynx) presented with a mean age of 56 years (41-69). They included 7 pharyngeal cancer patients and 2 laryngeal ones. Esophageal cancer was discovered synchronously in 6 patients and metachronously in 3 (1, 4, and 11 years later, respectively). The head and neck cancer was stage-I in one patient, stage-II in 4 and stage-IV in 4. The esophageal cancer was cervical in 2, thoracic in 6 and abdominal in 1. It was early cancer (stage-0) in 6 patients and advanced (stage-IV) in 3. The esophageal cancer was more advanced in the metachronous group, while it was early in the synchronous group. Since the head and neck cancer was advanced, all patients underwent a total laryngectomy for their head and neck cancers. As for esophageal surgery, a transhiatal esophagectomy was, in principle, performed for early cancers while a total thoracic esophagectomy was done for advanced cancers. For the reconstruction of the esophagus, a gastric tube was used. Four patients are still alive with a mean survival time of 25 months, whereas five died of cancer recurrence of either type a mean of 19 months after surgery. As compared with the survival rates of the patients with esophageal cancer alone, the 5-year survival rate was 18.2% for patients with double cancers in this series and 27.9% for those with esophageal cancer alone."
