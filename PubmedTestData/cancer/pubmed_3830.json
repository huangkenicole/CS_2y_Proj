        "The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been studied widely because it exists in various isozymic forms. The association of A and B subunits of LDH can generate five tetrameric isozymes, but the finding of the sixth isozyme in mature human testis and sperm indicated the presence of an additional subunit of LDH, designated as LDH-X (also termed LDH-C4 due to tetrameric nature of C-subunit). LDH-C4 isozyme is an iso-, allo-, and auto-antigen present in mammalian sperm cells. The synthesis of LDH-C4 in the testis takes place during sexual maturation, and it is the predominant fraction in mature spermatozoa. Though, originally considered to be testis specific, LDH-C or Ldh3 in mice was later detected in the murine oocyte and early embryo. Ldh3 in mouse supports its role in energy production in spermatids that favor lactate as substrate and in spermatozoa with a characteristic aerobic glycolytic path to yield ATP. During last two decades, cancer/testis-associated genes (CTAs) which are expressed only in the germinal epithelium of the testis are also expressed in some cancer cells, but not in non-cancerous somatic tissues. The CTAs are considered promising candidates for diagnosis and immunotherapy of cancer. The sperm-specific Ldh-c gene has been shown to express in a broad spectrum of human tumors, with high frequency in lung cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer; the protein being expressed virtually in all tumor types tested. Accordingly, LDH-C4 is the unique target for contraception in both males and females and offers potential future for immunotherapy of different types of cancers. As LDH-C has a preference for lactate as a substrate, LDH-C activation in cancer may depend on lactate for ATP production. The major aim of this article is to review the salient features of LDH-C subunit and the immune responses of LDH-C4 in homologous and heterologous species in relation to its role in acceptance or rejection of the allograft and its application in contraception and immunotherapy of cancer, directly or indirectly through the regulation of its substrate, the lactate."
