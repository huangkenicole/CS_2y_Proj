        "BACKGROUND To evaluate the role of double-lung transplantation (DLT) for lung cancer, the survival outcomes of patients who underwent DLT for lung cancer and the incidence of de novo lung cancer after DLT were assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from all cases reported in the literature were pooled for analysis and additional data were collected from the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) registry. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients who underwent DLT for lung cancer were determined. Moreover, the incidence of de novo lung cancer and associated OS in lung transplant recipients were examined. RESULTS Of the 20 cases series and 15 cases from the OPTN registry, the 5-year RFS was 55.0% and 66.7% and the 5-year OS was 55.0% and 26.7%, respectively, and the median CSS was 48.0 (range, 2.0-144.0) and 27.7 (range, 0.2-66.6) months, respectively. In the OPTN data, the incidence of post-transplant lung cancer in patients who underwent DLT for the non-cancerous disease was 0.8% and the 5-year OS was 47.3%. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our integrated analysis of the case series and the OPTN registry demonstrated promising survival outcomes for patients with refractory bilateral lung cancer who underwent DLT. Although there are limitations to consider, the results of this study underscore the potential benefits of DLT in managing refractory lung-limited lung cancer."
