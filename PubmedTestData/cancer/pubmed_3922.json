        "This study assessed cancer knowledge, beliefs, and awareness of signs, symptoms, and early detection methods in immigrant Salvadorean women in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (DCMA). A face-to-face survey sampled 843 females aged 20 and above. Descriptive statistics were used to compute frequency of response for sociodemographic characteristics, beliefs, and awareness of signs, symptoms, and early detection methods. The sample's mean age was 34.5 years; 10% had no schooling, and 7.4% had more than a high school education. Sixty-six percent of the women worked full- or part-time; 16% had an annual income of $20,000 or more; and 26% reported having medical insurance. Thirty percent of the sample lacked knowledge of the etiology and spread of cancer. The statement, \"Bumps on your body can cause cancer\" was endorsed by 61.6%. Beliefs that \"destiny cannot be changed\" or \"just about anything can cause cancer\" were prevalent among 18.5%. \"Cancer is a punishment from God\" was believed by 10.9%. A general physical examination was the most frequent (82%) early detection method mentioned. The Pap test was identified by 24.2%, and mammography by 14%; 5.6% mentioned breast self examination. Similar to other Hispanics, immigrant Salvadorean women in DCMA demonstrated a lack of knowledge of cancer's signs and symptoms, and early detection methods of and beliefs about cancer. Educational programs designed specifically for immigrant Salvadorean women to increase their knowledge of cancer and prevention methods are essential."
