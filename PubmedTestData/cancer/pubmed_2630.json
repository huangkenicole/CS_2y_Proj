        "A novel tumor-associated antigen, RCAS1 (receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells) is expressed at a high frequency in human uterine and ovarian cancer cells as well as in other mammalian cancer cells. We investigated a relationship between RCAS1 expression and clinicopathological features in gastric cancer. Immunohistochemically, RCAS1 was detected in 98.4% of gastric carcinomas. However, its expression was also observed in non-cancerous gastric epithelial cells including gastric adenomas (100%), gastric ulcers (66.7%) and normal gastric epithelia (100%). Striking difference was observed in the pattern of RCAS1 expression between benign and malignant cells. In cases of normal gastric mucosae, gastric ulcers and gastric adenomas, RCAS1 was localized only in the perinuclear region of the mucosal epithelial cells (PN pattern), while, in most of gastric cancers (83.9%), it was detected diffusely in the cytoplasm and cell membranes of the tumor cells (DC pattern). In semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, RCAS1 mRNA levels in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues were significantly higher than those in non-neoplastic tissues (p=0.038). The PN pattern of RCAS1 expression was more frequently observed in well differentiated adenocarcinoma (25%) than in moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (0%) (p=0.01). In addition, it is noteworthy that DC pattern of RCAS1 expression was more frequently recognized in carcinomas which invaded beyond the submucosa (100%) compared to intramucosal carcinoma (67.7%) (p=0.0026). These findings suggest that altered intracellular distribution of RCAS1 is strictly associated with tumor progression of gastric cancer and is a useful marker for the diagnosis and prognosis in gastric cancer."
