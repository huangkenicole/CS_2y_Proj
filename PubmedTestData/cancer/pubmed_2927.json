        "Early detection and differential analysis of premalignant lesions are very important for both prognosis and therapy of cancer patients. A good source of diagnostic tools is the natural antibody pool of humans. Tumor-specific antibodies can be established by using hybridoma technology. The fully human germline-coded monoclonal IgM antibody PAM-1 was isolated from a patient with a stomach carcinoma. PAM-1 reacts with a post-transcriptionally modified isoform of membrane receptor CFR-1 which is overexpressed on almost all epithelial cancers of all types and origins. The expression of CFR-1/PAM-1 on precancerous stages of breast and prostate cancer was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and compared with normal breast and prostate tissue as well as adenocarcinomas of both. In addition FACS analysis was performed to detect receptor expression on benign and malign prostate cells. 73 different tissue samples of prostate and breast precancerous stages and prostate and breast carcinomas were analysed for CFR-1/PAM-1 expression immunohistochemically. The CFR-1/PAM-1 receptor was expressed on nearly all precancerous stages and carcinomas while normal breast and prostate tissue showed negative results. These results were confirmed by FACS analysis showing a CFR-1/PAM-1 expression only on prostate carcinoma cells but not on benign prostate hyperplasia cells. The unique expression of this new CFR-1/PAM-1 receptor makes the PAM-1 antibody an ideal diagnostic and even therapeutic tool for precancerous and cancerous epithelial lesions of the breast and the prostate."
