        "Because of tremendous advances in HIV care, the survival of many people living with HIV (PLWH) now approaches that of the general population. This has led to a shift in the types of malignancies diagnosed among PLWH from AIDS-defining cancers during the height of the HIV epidemic toward more non-AIDS-defining cancers and age-related incidental cancers in the last 2 decades. Despite these trends, positive cancer outcomes still lag behind patients without HIV, and many PLWH never receive appropriate cancer therapy. We explore the reasons for the epidemiologic shift that has been observed, as well as the factors that influence treatment disparities. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated similar cancer survival rates when PLWH and certain cancers receive the same treatment as those who are HIV-negative. Among possible solutions to improve cancer outcomes include increasing the inclusion of PLWH in clinical trials, using guidelines specific for the treatment of HIV-associated malignancies, and incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to cancer management in PLWH."
