        "The purpose of this study is to assess the risk factors, biomarkers of stroke, mechanism, and outcomes of cerebral infarction among cancerous diseases.",
        "156 patients presented by acute ischemic stroke were divided into two groups: the first group included 78 ischemic stroke patients associated with different types of cancer and the second group (control group) included 78 ischemic stroke patients not associated with cancer. Both groups were compared regarding the risk factors, previous thrombotic activity, subtypes, biomarkers of stroke, and outcomes.",
        "Cancer patients presented by acute ischemic stroke were accompanied by a significantly less incidence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease, and atrial fibrillation than non-cancer patients (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). While, levels of biomarkers of inflammation like erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and stroke biomarkers like fibrinogen, and D-dimer, all together were highly elevated in cancerous disease group of patients (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). The prevalence of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction was significantly higher in patients with cancer than in control patients without cancer (P\u202f=\u202f0.008, P\u202f<\u202f0.01 and P\u202f<\u202f0.01 respectively). The most common stroke etiologies were atherosclerosis of large arteries and stroke of undetermined cause in a cancerous group of patients. Cancer patients were accompanied by significant higher mortality rate (P\u202f=\u202f0.005), and more disability as determined by mRS (P\u202f<\u202f0.005) CONCLUSIONS: Pathophysiology and mechanism of ischemic stroke in cancerous disease patients were due to different risk factors, biomarkers of stroke, and subtypes in comparison with non- cancerous cases."
