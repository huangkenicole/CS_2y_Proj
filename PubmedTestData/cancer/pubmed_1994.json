        "Case 1: A man in his sixties underwent extended right lobectomy of the liver for hepatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma (stage III, fCur B)in July2002. CT scans revealed cancerous pleuritis in March 2005, and he was treated with the chemotherapy of GEM alone as first-line, combined chemotherapy of S-1 and GEM as second-line, and CDDP and GEM as third-line treatment. These therapies have been effective for about 20 months. Case 2: A woman in her sixties was diagnosed with advanced gallbladder cancer(stage IVb)in September 2005. She was given combined chemotherapy of S-1+GEM as first-line, and CDDP+GEM as second-line treatment. The main tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were shrunk, allowing us to perform extended hepatectomy. Histopathologic examinations of the resected specimen of the liver involved by the tumor showed the increased infiltration of inflammatorycells and fibrosis. These patients have been managed on an outpatient basis with good QOL and cancer controlled. Although there has been no established standard regimen, the combined chemotherapy based on GEM will be a provisional standard regimen for patients with advanced biliarytract cancers."
