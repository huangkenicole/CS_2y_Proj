        "Some markers of angiogenic endothelial cells are emerging as targets for cancer therapy. The present study compared the expression of CD105 with that of other endothelial markers in cancers from various organs. Surgically resected cancer tissues from 188 patients comprising brain (n = 17), lung (n = 38), breast (n = 30), stomach (n = 30), colon (n = 31), liver (n = 32), and kidney (n = 10) cancers were immunohistochemically analyzed on tissue microarrays using a panel of eight endothelial markers. CD31 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells in cancer lesions as well as in non-cancerous areas (30-100%) in all core tissue samples. CD105 expression was intense and restricted to capillary endothelial cells in cancer lesions (>73%). In contrast, positive expression of CD105 was seen in <20% of non-cancerous areas in the same organs. However, no significant difference in CD105 expression in vascular endothelial cells between cancer lesions and non-cancerous areas from liver and renal cancer samples was found. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flt1, and Flk1 were also expressed, but only sporadically and in few samples (<30%), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and TGF-betaRII were negative in vascular endothelial cells but generally positive in cancer cells. CD44 was strongly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver (90-100%). These results show that CD105 is expressed specifically in the tumor angiogenesis of brain, lung, breast, stomach, and colon cancers."
