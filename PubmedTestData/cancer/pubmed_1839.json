        "The epidemiology of lung cancer has changed in the last years in several countries all over the world. In the 19th century, the lung cancer was rare but it incidence increase drastically during the 20th century, and the tendency is to continue in the 20th century. Actually the lung cancer's incidence and mortality are higher in the developed countries, especially in Europe and Unites States of America, with a increasing in the women incidence. These geographic differences and gender differences are related with smoking habits. Women begin to smoke earlier and have more difficulty to stop, because of problems related with obesity; they have more sensibility to the carcinogens and the risk of lung cancer is 1.5 times higher than the men with the same habits. Adenocarcinoma is the more frequent histological type in young people, in the total of the women and in non-smokers. Many factors since tobacco, home and professional pollution, nutritional, associated diseases even genetic and hormonal factors have been investigated to define its influence in development in women lung cancer. It specificity in women with lung cancer is the common problem for the medical people to treat this disease (pathology).The literature about this problem is not clear, and is necessary to advance with many studies in this area with the objective to clarify this important question."
