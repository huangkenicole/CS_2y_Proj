        "High frequency electromagnetic fields are used currently in clinical therapy of cancer. A considerable research effort is spent on improving field application techniques. The main difficulty encountered is the establishment of a sufficient temperature difference between normal and cancerous tissue for effective therapy. Therefore I propose a temperature cycling technique in field applications which should permit achieving higher temperatures in the tumor region while temperatures in normal tissue remain within a physiological range. It is expected that by this technique an improvement in cancer cure rate could be obtained."
