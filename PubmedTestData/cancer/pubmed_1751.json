        "Cancer is the one of the fatal and dreaded disease responsible for huge number of morbidity and mortality across the globe. It is expected that the global burden will increase to 21.7 million fresh cancer cases as compared to present estimate of 18.1 million cancer cases in addition to nearly 9.6 million cancer deaths worldwide. In response to cancerous or certain benign conditions; specific type of tumor or cancer markers (biomarkers) are produced at much higher levels which are secreted into the urine, blood, stool, tumor or other tissues. Therefore, the efficient and early detection of cancer biomarkers is necessary which can offer a reliable way for cancer patient screening and diagnosis. This process not only helps in the evaluation of pathogenic processes but also the prognosis of different cancers and pharmacological responses to therapeutic interventions are secured. Over the past several years, electrochemical detection methods have proved to be the most attractive methods among many, due to the advantages, such as simple instrumentation, portability, low cost and high sensitivity. Furthermore, the modifications of these electrochemical immunosensors by utilizing various types of nanomaterials enable these systems to detect trace amount of target tumor markers. Hence, herein, we intend to review the selective works on electrochemical detection of various biomarkers using wide range of nanomaterials with a particular focus on graphene."
