        "Among 22,868 autopsied adults were 7,411 cases with cholelithiasis or cholecystectomy. In the cancerous gallbladders pigment-stones, pure crystalline cholesterol stones and lobulates stones were seldom found but multiple faceted stones and solitary combined stones are more frequent. If the partial volume of gallstones increased, there were more cases with cholecystitis or later carcinoma. Nevertheless in males with all forms of gallstones, carcinoma of the lung, the stomach, the colon and rectum and the prostatic gland were more frequent then carcinoma of the gallbladder. Only in female with multiple faceted stones and solitary combined stones, carcinoma of the gallbladder was the most frequent cancer. The \"St\u00f6rfeld\" of the gallbladder with stones is more important for the localisation of a later carcinoma in female then for men. If the gallbladder with stones should be resected in good time, the patient is protected of the risk of cancer of gallbladder, but the percentage of all cancers among inoperated cases with gallstones is not higher than among cases with previons cholecystectomy. Instead of carcinoma of the gallbladder other cancers develop after cholecystectomy."
