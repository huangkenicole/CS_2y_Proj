      "AbstractText": [
        "The Cu, Cd, Ni, and Pb contents of blood and tissue samples of some cancer patients in a Pakistani population were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results were compared with those found in the blood samples of healthy controls selected from persons with known previous health record. The trace element contents were found to be different in various cancer types, age groups, and between male and females. The results of this investigation showed that the average Cd and Ni concentrations were higher in the blood of cancer patients as compared to controls. Copper levels in the blood of male cancer patients were higher than the controls and the opposite was the case for females. The concentration levels of Pb in the blood were almost the same in all groups. In cancerous tissues the concentrations of Cu were found to be lower as compared to the unaffected part of the same organ of the same patient. The relationship of Cd and Ni to carcinogenesis is well established now and their abnormal levels could indicate an exposure to them. Changes in copper levels could be due to the altered metabolic requirements of the subjects under biological stress i.e. presence of cancer."
