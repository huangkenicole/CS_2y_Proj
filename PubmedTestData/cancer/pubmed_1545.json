        "Amino acid deprivation therapy (AADT) is emerging as a promising strategy for the development of novel therapeutics against cancer. This biological therapy relies upon the differences in the metabolism of cancer and normal cells. The rapid growth of tumors results in decreased expression of certain enzymes leading to auxotrophy for some specific amino acids. These auxotrophic tumors are targeted by amino acid-depleting enzymes. The depletion of amino acid selectively inhibits tumor growth as the normal cells can synthesize amino acids by their usual machinery. The enzymes used in AADT are mostly obtained from microbes for their easy availability. Microbial L-asparaginase is already approved by FDA for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Arginine deiminase and methionase are under clinical trials and the therapeutic potential of lysine oxidase, glutaminase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase is also being explored. The present review provides an overview of microbial amino acid depriving enzymes. Various attributes of these enzymes like structure, mode of action, production, formulations, and targeted cancers are discussed. The challenges faced and the combat strategies to establish AADT in standard cancer armamentarium are also reviewed.Key Points \u2022 Amino acid deprivation therapy is a potential therapy for auxotrophic tumors. \u2022 Microbial enzymes are used due to their ease of manipulation and high productivity. \u2022 Enzyme properties are improved by PEGylation, encapsulation, and genetic engineering. \u2022 AADT can be employed as combinational therapy for better containment of cancer."
