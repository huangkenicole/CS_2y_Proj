        "Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a histopathologically-defined, potentially premalignant condition of the oral cavity. The rate of transformation to frank carcinoma is relatively low (12% within 2 years) and prediction based on histopathological grade is unreliable, leading to both over- and under-treatment. Alternative approaches include infrared (IR) spectroscopy, which is able to classify cancerous and non-cancerous tissue in a number of cancers, including oral. The aim of this study was to explore the capability of FTIR (Fourier-transform IR) microscopy and machine learning as a means of predicting malignant transformation of OED. Supervised, retrospective analysis of longitudinally-collected OED biopsy samples from 17 patients with high risk OED lesions: 10 lesions transformed and 7 did not over a follow-up period of more than 3 years. FTIR spectra were collected from routine, unstained histopathological sections and machine learning used to predict malignant transformation, irrespective of OED classification. PCA-LDA (principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis) provided evidence that the subsequent transforming status of these 17 lesions could be predicted from FTIR data with a sensitivity of 79 \u00b1 5% and a specificity of 76 \u00b1 5%. Six key wavenumbers were identified as most important in this classification. Although this pilot study used a small cohort, the strict inclusion criteria and classification based on known outcome, rather than OED grade, make this a novel study in the field of FTIR in oral cancer and support the clinical potential of this technology in the surveillance of OED."
