        "Correlations between the malignant potential and prognosis of cancer and abnormal control mechanisms of apoptosis have been discovered in a variety of cancers. Survivin is a member of the inhibiting apoptosis protein family that is abundant in embryonic and carcinoma tissues. We measured the expression of survivin mRNA in gastric cancer to determine whether levels of survivin mRNA expression could serve as an index of malignancy.",
        "Expression of survivin mRNA was measured in samples of both gastric cancer and noncancerous tissue from 107 patients. Survivin mRNA was detected by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and then the relationship between the survivin mRNA level and histological diagnosis was analyzed.",
        "Expression of survivin mRNA was observed in 105 of 107 cancerous tissues and in 101 of 107 noncancerous tissues. The Mean value of survivin mRNA expression in cancerous tissue was 5.18 +/- 1.30, significantly higher ( P < 0.01) than that in noncancerous tissue, at 4.21 +/- 1.48. No significant differences were found in the values of survivin mRNA expression according to histological classification or according to increasing depth of tumor invasion. However, survivin mRNA expression was significantly higher ( P < 0.01) in patients displaying lymph node metastasis (5.48 +/- 1.01) than in patients without the metastasis (4.70 +/- 1.55).",
        "These results indicate that increased survivin mRNA expression begins in the early stages of gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, the level of survivin mRNA expression may indicate the potential for lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer. Correlations between the malignant potential and prognosis of cancer and abnormal control mechanisms of apoptosis have been discovered in a variety of cancers. Survivin is a member of the inhibiting apoptosis protein family that is abundant in embryonic and carcinoma tissues. We measured the expression of survivin mRNA in gastric cancer to determine whether levels of survivin mRNA expression could serve as an index of malignancy."
