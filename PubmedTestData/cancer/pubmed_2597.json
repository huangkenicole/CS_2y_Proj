        "Recently, the impact of microorganisms on tumor growth and metastasis has attracted great attention. The pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer are related to an increase in respiratory bacterial load as well as changes in the bacterial community because the microbiota affects tumors in many ways, including canceration, metastasis, angiogenesis, and treatment. The microbiota may increase tumor susceptibility by altering metabolism and immune responses, promoting inflammation, and increasing toxic effects. The microbiota can regulate tumor metastasis by altering multiple cell signaling pathways and participate in tumor angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), endothelial cells (ECs), inflammatory factors and inflammatory cells. Tumor angiogenesis not only maintains tumor growth at the primary site but also promotes tumor metastasis and invasion. Therefore, angiogenesis is an important mediator of the interaction between microorganisms and tumors. The microbiota also plays a part in antitumor therapy. Alteration of the microbiota caused by antibiotics can regulate tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, the microbiota also influences the efficacy and toxicity of tumor immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, the effects of air pollution, a risk factor for lung cancer, on microorganisms and the possible role of respiratory microorganisms in the effects of air pollution on lung cancer are discussed."
