        "The development of colorectal cancer is characterized by a multitude of molecular events that can occur through the pathways of loss of heterozygosity, microsatellite instability, and CpG-island methylation. The accumulation of these molecular events ultimately results in polyps formed from previously normal mucosa to develop the fundamental characteristics of cancerization: uncontrolled proliferation, growth, and invasion. Advances in the understanding of molecular events leading to colorectal cancer have led to the development of biomarkers, patient-specific and tumor-specific molecular signatures that have potential as tools for accurate risk assessment, personalized treatment planning, development of targeted agents, and evaluation of treatment response."
