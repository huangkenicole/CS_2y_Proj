        "In this study, we evaluate the clinical significance of the PRSS3 and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) by immunohistochemistry.In current study, all adjacent non-cancerous tissues showed absent or low expression of PRSS3. The expression of PRSS3 was significantly increased in the EOCs than adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, the expression of WAVE1 was significantly observed in all EOC tissues when compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, WAVE1 expression was absent in 35 (89.74\u00a0%) adjacent non-cancerous tissues.Our findings showed that high expression of PRSS3 was markedly linked to FIGO stage (P\u2009=\u20090.02), advanced grade (P\u2009=\u20090.017), and lymph node metastases (P\u2009=\u20090.001), but no relationship was determined with other clinicopathological parameters. Furthermore, high expression of WAVE1 was significantly correlated with FIGO stage (P\u2009=\u20090.001), grade of tumor (P\u2009=\u20090.011), and residual tumor size (P\u2009=\u20090.041), but no significant associations were found between WAVE1 expression and age, lymph node metastasis, and histological subtypes (all P\u2009>\u20090.05). In conclusion, our study showed that increased expression of PRSS3 and WAVE1 may be involved in development of EOC."
