        "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinicopathological features of early gastric cancers after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 26 cases of gastric cancer that were diagnosed after H. pylori eradication and 45 cases without H. pylori eradication in the 989 Hospital of the Joint Logistics Support Force of the People's Liberation Army (the former 152 Hospital), Pingdingshan, China from 2013 to 2021 were collected. The histological, immunophenotypic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared, and discussed with review of the related literature. <b>Results:</b> Among the gastric cancer patients with H. pylori eradication, there were 20 males and 6 females with a median age of 65 years (range 53 to 77 years). The cancer involved the upper part of the stomach in 12 cases, the middle part of the stomach in 4 cases, and the lower part of the stomach in 10 cases. The median diameter of the tumors was 12 mm (range 4-29 mm). According to the Paris Classification, 4 cases were 0-\u2161a, 4 cases were 0-\u2161b, 18 cases were 0-\u2161c. White light endoscopy showed that the lesions were reddish to yellowish. The lesion boundary was clear in 12 cases and was unclear or gastritis-like changes in 14 cases, while the irregular microvascular structure and microsurface structure, as well as the relatively visible spinous boundary, were visible under narrow-band imaging. There were 20 cases of well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, 4 cases of highly to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and 2 cases of well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with papillary adenocarcinoma. Compared with gastric cancers without H. pylori eradication, gastric cancers diagnosed after H. pylori eradication was associated with lower nucleus-cytoplasm ratio (<50%), normal epithelial coverage on the cancer surface, mild atypical epithelial coverage on the cancer surface, elongation of non-cancerous glands in the cancer tissue and subepithelial progression of cancerous glands were higher (<i>P</i><0.05). The cellular immunophenotypes were gastric type in 6 cases, intestinal type in 4 cases and gastrointestinal mixed type in 16 cases. <b>Conclusions:</b> The early gastric cancers diagnosed after H. pylori eradication are more subtle clinically and mostly well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. The important morphological features of gastric cancer diagnosed after H. pylori eradication are decreased cytological atypia and overlying normal epithelium or mildly atypical epithelium of the cancer. Understanding and recognizing these morphological features are helpful to make correct endoscopic and pathological diagnoses."
