        "Members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family including survivin, are expressed in many tumors. However, age-related changes in their expression in cancer have not been clarified. Thus, we investigated the expression of mRNA-coding for IAP family proteins in colon cancer samples from young (<70 years of age) and elderly (>70 years) patients by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Samples were collected from cases with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and their adjacent normal epithelial tissue. Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma tended to express higher levels of survivin than normal mucosa, and expression in moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was significantly greater than in normal mucosa in samples from both groups of patients ( p<0.05, respectively). When samples were compared between the different age groups, the normal mucosa exhibited similar levels of survivin expression. However, samples from older patients showed a significantly higher level of expression than those from younger patients in well and moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas ( p<0.05, respectively). In contrast, the levels of expression of cIAP1, cIAP2, and NAIP in the cancerous tissues were lower than those found in normal mucosa regardless of age. As for age-related changes, the expression of cIAP2 in normal mucosa and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was stronger in the elderly group than the young group ( p<0.05, respectively), and NAIP expression in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was higher in the young group than the elderly group ( p<0.05). XIAP expression was similar in normal and cancerous tissues in both the young and elderly groups. These results suggest that the expression of IAP family proteins, especially survivin, is associated with the age-related biological characteristics of colon cancer."
