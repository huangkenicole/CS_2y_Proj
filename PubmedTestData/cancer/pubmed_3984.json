        "Aims of this study were to (1) compare anti-proliferative activity between aqueous and ethanol Kaempferia parviflora (KP) extracts in both cancer (Human urinary bladder cancer cell, T24) and normal cell lines (Human umbilical vein endothelial cell, HUVEC). (2) confirm selective cytotoxicity of ethanol KP extract to normal and different cancer cell lines (3) investigate its cellular mechanism through p53 and SIRT1 gene expression.",
        "Phytochemical difference between aqueous and ethanol extract was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Screening for cytotoxic activity in human cell lines was performed by cell viability assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent. P53 and SIRT1 gene expression were quantified using RT-PCR.",
        "Results from the cell viability assay were shown as follows: (1) ethanol extract possessed higher toxicity to cancerous cells than aqueous extract (2) ethanol extract exhibited higher cytotoxicity to cancerous cells than normal cells (3) ethanol extract also showed cytotoxicity, with different levels, to three prostate cancer cell lines varying in aggressiveness. (4) ethanol KP extract induced cell death in T24 via p53 gene expression and prolonged cell survival in HUVEC through SIRT1 gene expression.",
        "These findings implied that ethanol KP extract might possibly be an alternative for cancer adjuvant therapy through the mechanism of selective p53 and SIRT1 gene expression."
