        "The term field cancerization was proposed by Slaughter in 1953 to describe multifocal neoplastic lesions in the oral mucosa. Currently, it is well known that field cancerization can occur also in the skin. There is no one, universal and generally accepted management for the patients with multiple actinic keratosis and field cancerization. We presented two cases with large field cancerization on the face and the scalp. In both patients, we performed one stage surgery with split thickness skin graft with good final esthetic and functional result. Available literature on the role of classical surgical removal in treating field cancerization is very limited. We believe that surgery can be consider as an option for the treatment in some high risk patients with very large field cancerization, but further observation and evaluation of this method is needed."
