        "Early stage of gastric cancers were divided into two subtypes; differentiated and undifferentiated adenocarcinomas, histologically. We examined the involvement of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in the development and progression of cancer, and presence or absence of peptic ulcer (UL+/UL-). From the results, these findings obtained as follows; 1) Hp positive rate of UL+ group was significantly higher than that of UL-group. 2) Neither of gross features nor depth of the tumor did not correlate with Hp positive rates. 3) Hp positive rate of undifferentiated type carcinoma was significantly higher than that of differentiated type, contrarily to our expectation. These findings suggested that Hp infection might relate with ulcer formation in the cancerous lesion. The hypothesis which is \"gastritis-intestinal metaplasia-differentiated type carcinoma sequence\" was not supported by present study. Hence, Hp infection was suggested as an important factor of the gastric cancer development and progression, not only in differentiated type but also in undifferentiated type."
