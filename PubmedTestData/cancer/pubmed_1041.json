        "The transcription factor GLI3 is a member of the Hedgehog (Hh/HH) signaling pathway that can exist as a full length (Gli3-FL/GLI3-FL) or repressor (Gli3-R/GLI3-R) form. In response to HH activation, GLI3-FL regulates HH genes by targeting the GLI1 promoter. In the absence of HH signaling, GLI3 is phosphorylated leading to its partial degradation and the generation of GLI3-R which represses HH functions. GLI3 is also involved in tissue development, immune cell development and cancer. The absence of Gli3 in mice impaired brain and lung development and GLI3 mutations in humans are the cause of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (GCPS) and Pallister Hall syndromes (PHS). In the immune system GLI3 regulates B, T and NK-cells and may be involved in LPS-TLR4 signaling. In addition, GLI3 was found to be upregulated in multiple cancers and was found to positively regulate cancerous behavior such as anchorage-independent growth, angiogenesis, proliferation and migration with the exception in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and medulloblastoma where GLI plays an anti-cancerous role. Finally, GLI3 is a target of microRNA. Here, we will review the biological significance of GLI3 and discuss gaps in our understanding of this molecule. Video Abstract."
