        "Cancer cells exhibit a wide range of metabolic phenotypes, ranging from strict aerobic glycolysis to increased mitochondrial respiration. The cause and utility of this metabolic variation is poorly understood. Given that cancer cells experience heavy selection within their microenvironment, survival requires metabolic adaptation to both extracellular and intracellular conditions. Herein, we suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a key determinant of cancer's metabolic phenotype. Intracellular ROS levels can be modified by an assortment of critical parameters including oxygenation, glucose availability and growth factors. ROS act as integrators of environmental information as well as downstream effectors of signaling pathways. Maintaining ROS within a narrow range allows malignant cells to enhance growth and invasion while limiting their apoptotic susceptibility. Cancer cells actively modify their metabolism to optimize intracellular ROS levels and thereby improve survival. Furthermore, we highlight distinct metabolic phenotypes in response to oxidative stress and their tumorigenic drivers."
