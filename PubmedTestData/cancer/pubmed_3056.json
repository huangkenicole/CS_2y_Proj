        "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women, and most breast cancer related deaths are due to metastases. Uterine metastases from breast cancer are uncommon and rarely reported in the literature. We described the case of a 50 years-old-woman who developed a uterine metastasis, 6 years after the diagnosis of an invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Indeed, although the patient was asymptomatic, the monitoring imaging examinations, particularly the computed tomography (CT) and the positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), showed a myometrial lesion. Non-conservative total hysterectomy was performed. The anatomo-pathological examination revealed a myometrial metastasis from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Seventeen months after surgery, the patient had no pelvic recurrence, but lungs and bones metastases progressed despite chemotherapy. In the lack of guidelines of uterine metastases from breast cancer's management, we reviewed the existing literature with the aim to provide a rational framework for clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, histological findings and treatment of this rare and heterogeneous pathology. Uterine metastases of breast cancer are frequently revealed with metrorrhagia. They occur preferentially in tumours with initial lobular carcinoma, initial lymph node involvement and positive hormonal receptors."
