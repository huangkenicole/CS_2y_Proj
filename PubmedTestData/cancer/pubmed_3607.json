        "The small sized lesion of the large bowel advanced cancer has been noticed in the development of the large bowel cancer. In this study, 17 lesions of the large bowel advanced cancer within less than 2 cm in diameter were studied clinicopathologically and histologically, according with PG(polypoid growth), NPG(non polypoid growth) classification and the subclassification of NPG, in which NPG-1 was defined that the height of the adjacent mucosa to the carcinomatous lesion was taller than that of the cancerous lesion, and the NPG except for NPG-1 was defined as NPG-2. And all of 17 lesions were NPG type(NPG-1:9 lesions, NPG-2:8 lesions). The results revealed that NPG-1 lesions were significantly smaller in maximum diameter, the invasion depth of its were deeper, these degree of venous invasion were higher and these carcinomatous differentiation were lower, comparing with those of NPG-2 lesions. In conclusion, it was indicated that the NPG-1 lesion was the large bowel advanced cancer which deeply invaded at the small-sized condition."
