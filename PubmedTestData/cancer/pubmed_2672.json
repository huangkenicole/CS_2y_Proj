        "Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the leading cancers in terms of incidence and mortality in the Western world. Currently, there are no sufficient diagnostic markers that would enable an early diagnosis and efficient therapy. Unfortunately, a significant number of new CRC cases is detected in late stages, with distant metastases, therefore, new therapeutic approaches, which would alleviate the prognosis for advanced stages of CRC, are highly in demand. SNHG6 belongs to the group of long non-coding RNAs, which are a larger entity of RNAs consisting of >200 nucleotides. SNHG6 is expressed mainly in the cell cytoplasm, where it acts as a regulator of numerous processes: modulation of crucial protein hubs; sponging miRNAs and upregulating the expression of their target mRNAs; and interacting with various cellular pathways including TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. SNHG6 is an oncogene, substantially overexpressed in CRC tissues and cancerous cell lines as compared to healthy samples. Its overexpression is associated with higher grade, lymphovascular invasion and tumor size. Taking into consideration the role of SNHG6 in the colorectal tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis, we summarized its role in CRC and conclude that it could serve as a potential biomarker in CRC diagnosis and prognosis assessment."
