        "To investigate the effectiveness and indication of intranasal endoscopic resection of sinonasal benign tumors.",
        "A retrospective comparative study was made of intranasal endoscopy among twelve patients with benign tumors and twelve patients with inverting papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses between October 1996 and June 2001. A follow-up was made for ten months to five years.",
        "Of the twelve cases of benign tumors, five cases of hemangioma including one case of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, one case of fibroma and one case of neurofibroma as well as one case of benign fibromatosis of nasal ethmoid sinus were completely excised without any evidence of recurrence so far. Of the four patients with ossifying fibromas, two cases with ethmoid sinus invasion underwent successful total removal without any recurrence three years after operation, one case was completely ablated after second procedure and another case had her tumor subtotally resected with symptom remission. Of the twelve cases of inverting papilloma among which two patients had cancerated, eight achieved complete resection at first attempt, and the remaining four cases having either persistence or recurrence of tumor also got cured via endoscopic YAG laser or revision procedure. All these 12 patients except one were followed up for two to five years without any recurrence.",
        "With excellent visualization, a less operative invasiveness and no scar on face the endoscopic approach appears to be the method of choice for the treatment of some benign tumors including inverting papilloma of nose and paranasal sinuses."
