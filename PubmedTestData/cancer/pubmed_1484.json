        "Our understanding of breast cancer and its therapeutic approach has improved greatly due to the advancement of molecular biology in recent years. Clinically, breast cancers are characterized into three basic types based on their immunohistochemical properties. They are triple-negative breast cancer, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive-HR positive breast cancer, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Even though these subtypes have been characterized, assessment of a breast cancer's receptor status is still widely used to determine whether or not a targeted therapy could be applied. Moreover, drug resistance is common in all breast cancer types despite the different treatment modalities applied. The development of resistance to different therapeutics is not mutually exclusive. It seems that tumor could be resistant to multiple treatment strategies, such as being both chemoresistant and monoclonal antibody resistant. However, the underlying mechanisms are complicated and need further investigation. In this chapter, we aim to provide a brief review of the different types of breast cancer and their respective treatment strategies. We also review the possible mechanisms of potential drug resistance associated with each treatment type. We believe that a better understanding of the drug resistance mechanisms can lead to a more effective and efficient therapeutic success."
