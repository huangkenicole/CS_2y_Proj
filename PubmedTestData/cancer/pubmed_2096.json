      "AbstractText": [
        "Epithelial Protein Lost In Neoplasm (EPLIN), also known as LIMA1 (LIM Domain And Actin Binding 1), was first discovered as a protein differentially expressed in normal and cancerous cell lines. It is now known to be key to the progression and metastasis of certain solid tumours. Despite a slow pace in understanding the biological role in cells and body systems, as well as its clinical implications in the early years since its discovery, recent years have witnessed a rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms of this protein in cells, diseases and indeed the body. EPLIN has drawn more attention over the past few years with its roles expanding from cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics, to cell cycle, gene regulation, angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and lipid metabolism. This concise review summarises and discusses the recent progress in understanding EPLIN in biological processes and its implications in cancer."
