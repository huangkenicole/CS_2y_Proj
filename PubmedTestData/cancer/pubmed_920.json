      "AbstractText": [
        "Human mucin core cDNA-MUC-2 has been cloned and sequenced. Its major portion consists of amino acids tandem in arrangement with repetition in its sequence, locating at the 11th chromosome. Antibody against polypeptide MUC-2 was used for immunohistochemical SABC staining in order to investigate the expression of MUC-2 in human normal and cancerous tissues. The results revealed that MUC-2 was expressed in normal intestine and prostate, and accumulated in the colorectal cancer tissues, but not in other normal tissues or only weakly expressed in a few cases of pancreas, lung and breast cancers. If used in combining with monoclonal antibody against MUC-1, which is known to be expressed in normal and cancer tissues of pancreas, lung and breast, it is considered to be valuable for the differential diagnosis in detecting the origin of metastatic adenocarcinoma."
