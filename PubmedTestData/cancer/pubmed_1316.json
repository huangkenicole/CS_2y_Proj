        "Ovarian cancer's poor progression is closely associated with overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which belongs to the class of enzymes believed to be involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of MMP-9 are not completely understood. STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family of transcription factors is well known to be engaged in diverse cellular functions. Activation of STAT3 has been observed in a number of cancers, promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis via transcriptional activation of its target genes. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that STAT3 regulates MMP-9 gene expression in epithelial ovarian cancer. Using epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines as in vitro model, we show an abundance of phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705 (p-STAT3) in SKOV3 cell line. We further show that MMP-9 gene promoter was significantly enriched by p-STAT3, and IL-6 treatment led to a significant increase of MMP-9 at mRNA and protein levels, in addition to an association of p-STAT3 with MMP-9 gene. By using luciferase reporter assay, we determined that the STAT3 DNA responsive element of MMP-9 was sufficient to regulate transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of STAT3 regulates MMP-9 production in ovarian cancer, which might be responsible for its invasiveness and metastasis."
