      "AbstractText": [
        "Histopathology images of tumor biopsies present unique challenges for applying machine learning to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The pathology slides are high resolution, often exceeding 1GB, have non-uniform dimensions, and often contain multiple tissue slices of varying sizes surrounded by large empty regions. The locations of abnormal or cancerous cells, which may constitute a small portion of any given tissue sample, are not annotated. Cancer image datasets are also extremely imbalanced, with most slides being associated with relatively common cancers. Since deep representations trained on natural photographs are unlikely to be optimal for classifying pathology slide images, which have different spectral ranges and spatial structure, we here describe an approach for learning features and inferring representations of cancer pathology slides based on sparse coding.",
        "We show that conventional transfer learning using a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture pre-trained on ImageNet (RESNET) and fine tuned for a binary tumor/no-tumor classification task achieved between 85% and 86% accuracy. However, when all layers up to the last convolutional layer in RESNET are replaced with a single feature map inferred via a sparse coding using a dictionary optimized for sparse reconstruction of unlabeled pathology slides, classification performance improves to over 93%, corresponding to a 54% error reduction.",
        "We conclude that a feature dictionary optimized for biomedical imagery may in general support better classification performance than does conventional transfer learning using a dictionary pre-trained on natural images."
