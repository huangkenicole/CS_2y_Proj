        "The authors have used the cytological investigation of the liquid discharge from the breast to search systematically for cancerous states and, more usually, for borderline conditions in the breast. Using a simple technique it has been possible to obtain some discharge from the breast more or less easily. In 15 per 1000 cases cytological abnormalities have been found, which means that there were 39 pathological discharges in the 2490 women who were examined over five years. 27 of these were benign lesions and 12 of them were suspect. Of these latter three borderline conditions were found and one invasive cancer was found. All four were asymptomatic. It is therefore worth while examining discharges from the breast in screening for borderline conditions in young women."
