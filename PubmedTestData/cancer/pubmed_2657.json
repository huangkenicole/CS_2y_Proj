        "The brisk remodeling in healthcare delivery observed after the COVID-19 outbreak led us to evaluate how the pandemic affected non-melanoma skin cancer's (NMSC) care and tumor burden. To address this topic, we set up a retrospective real-life multi-center study based on the cities of Bergamo and Varese, whose provinces were the worst hit in Italy by the pandemic. We analyzed medical and pathological data from patients that underwent surgery in the two months preceding the outbreak in Italy and compared them to those who did in the corresponding bimester of the following year, reaching 214 patients and 274 lesions. We observed a considerable and significant increase in NMSC's diameter, as well as in the proportion of squamous cell carcinomas. Both the average waiting time to obtain an evaluation visit and the average time in the surgical waiting list was shorter after the COVID-19 outbreak: the reason is that we evaluated and operated near-exclusive patients affected by high-priority lesions, who benefited from \"fast-track\" referrals. Conversely, less-concerning lesions were, and still are, left on hold, until they will become advanced enough to be labeled as \"urgent\". Plastic surgery departments should evade as soon as possible from this downward spiral, in order to provide our patients with timely cancer care and to be able to treat all plastic surgery-requiring pathologies."
