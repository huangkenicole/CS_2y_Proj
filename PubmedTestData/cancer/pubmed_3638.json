        "Destruction of the tumor (cancerous) cells may be caused by live viruses, which have replicative ability and replicate selectively in tumor cells, known as oncolytic virotherapy. In comparison of conservative cancer therapy, tumor-selective replicating viruses have more advantages. These viruses have introduced new methodologies for the human cancer treatment. Numerous strategies are used in development of virotherapeutics. Virotherapy is not unusual concept, but modern advances in technology of genetic modification of oncolytic viruses have improved the ability of targeting tumor cells more specifically, it triggered the development of novel ammunition to fight cancer. An effective virotherapeutic approach with oncolytic viruses exhibits the feasibility and safety under clinical approach. New strategies are being explored to overcome basic obstacles and challenges in virotherapy. Administration of oncolytic viruses, logically, will successfully augment new treatments against many kinds of tumors. Some encouraging antitumor responses shown by combination therapy are provoking strong immunity against established cancer. Chief developments in oncolytic virotherapy have seen in past several years. Significant understandings have been provided by findings on the interface among immune comebacks and viruses, whereas potential results have shown in clinical trials."
