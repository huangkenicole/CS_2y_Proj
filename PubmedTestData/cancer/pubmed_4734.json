      "AbstractText": [
        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent an important group of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with more than 200 nucleotides in length that are transcribed from the so-called genomic \"dark matter.\" Mounting evidence has shown that lncRNAs have manifested a paramount function in the pathophysiology of human diseases, especially in the pathogenesis and progression of cancers. Despite the exponential growth in lncRNA publications, our understanding of regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs is still limited, and a lot of controversies remain in the current lncRNA knowledge.The purpose of this article is to explore the clinical significance and molecular mechanism of SNHG15 in tumors.",
        "We have systematically searched the Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane databases. We provide an overview of current evidence concerning the functional role, mechanistic models and clinical utilities of SNHG15 in human cancers in this review.",
        "Small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15), a novel lncRNA, is identified as a key regulator in tumorigenesis and progression of various human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), pancreatic cancer (PC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dysregulation of SNHG15 has been revealed to be dramatically correlated with advanced clinicopathological factors and predicts poor prognosis, suggesting its potential clinical value as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer patients.",
