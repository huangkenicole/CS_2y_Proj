      "AbstractText": [
        "Graphene oxide (GO) is an oxidized derivative of graphene. So far, GO has mostly been studied as a drug delivery method rather than a standalone drug for treating cancers like glioblastoma or cervical cancer. However, we propose a promising new approach-using GO as a sensitizer for cisplatin chemotherapy. Here, we analyze the effects of triple GO pretreatment, followed by cisplatin treatment, on cancerous cell lines U87 and HeLa, as well as the noncancerous cell line HS-5, through morphology analysis, viability assay, flow cytometry, and LDH release assay. The viability assay results showed that GO treatment made U87 and HeLa cells more responsive to cisplatin, leading to a significant reduction in cell viability to 40% and 72%, respectively, without affecting HS-5 cells viability, while the Annexin V/Propidium iodine assay showed that GO pretreatment did not cause a change in live cells in all three examined cell lines, while GO-pretreated HeLa cells treated with cisplatin showed significant decrease around two times compared to cells treated with cisplatin standalone. The U87 cell line showed a significant increase in LDH release, approximately 2.5 times higher than non-GO-pretreated cells. However, GO pretreatment did not result in LDH release in noncancerous HS-5 cells. It appears that this phenomenon underlays GO's ability to puncture the cell membrane of cancerous cells depending on its surface properties without harming noncancerous cells."
