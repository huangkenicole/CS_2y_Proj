        "Centrally located lung cancers are radiologically occult until so far advanced as to have a low cure rate or require extensive resection for cure, but at a cost of high morbidity. These cancers represent about one-fifth of new lung cancers. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy appears to be an important tool in localizing premalignant and early malignant lesions in the large central airways, particularly when applied to high-risk patients. Applications include studies of molecular biology of premalignancy and early malignancy, chemoprevention studies, endobronchial therapy studies, localization of synchronous tumors, estimation of the extent of field cancerization, and better estimation of resection margins. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy appears to be significantly more sensitive than white light examination but has low specificity. This technology is likely to gain widespread use when evaluation of sputum for malignant changes is both more sensitive and specific, and when its application is demonstrated to reduce mortality in this important subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer patients."
