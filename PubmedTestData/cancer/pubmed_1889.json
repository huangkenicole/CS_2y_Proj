        "The association between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis, as well as neoplastic progression, has been researched and is well-established. Being a central coordinator of immune responses, nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. The activation of the NFkappaB signaling pathway is highly monitored under normal conditions, and is mainly known as a key pathway in activation of immune responses. Constitutively active NFkappaB has been identified in most tumor cell lines, as well as in a wide variety of tumor tissues derived from cancer patients. Such activation may also affect the cancer's response to therapy, making it less susceptive to radio and chemo treatment. Hence, NFkappaB has become a target for inhibition by chemotherapeutic agents. Traditionally, medicinal herbs have been used to prevent and treat a variety of diseases, including cancer. In this article, we review several natural, herbal-derived compounds shown to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities mediated, at least in part, by NFkappaB signaling inhibition. Compounds of this sort may potentially serve as clinically effective anticancer treatments."
