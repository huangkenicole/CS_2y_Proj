        "We investigated the copy number variation (CNV) of PDGFRA pathway across all common cancer types as well as its clinical relevance. This study included a total of 10,678 patients with pan-cancerous species involving 33 types of cancers and patient information was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. According to the PDGFRA pathway CNV, all samples were divided into copy number gain (CN gain) group and No CN gain group. The analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) fraction, CNV burden, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the number of immunogenic mutations were performed, as well as the correlation analysis of PDGFRA pathway CN gain with tumor-related signaling pathways and tumor-infiltrating immune cell subpopulations. The results showed that CN gain of PDGFRA pathway in the cancer patients was associated with significantly shorter overall survival. The CN gain of PDGFRA pathway was identified as a prognostic risk factor for some tumors. CN gain was accompanied by an altered percentage of LOH, CNV burden, TMB, the number of immunogenic mutations were increased and tumor-infiltrating immune cell subpopulations were less. While certain tumor-related signaling pathways, such as hypoxia, cell cycle, DNA repair, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were more enriched in the CN gain group, quiescence, and inflammation pathways were more enriched in the No CN gain group. In conclusion, PDGFRA pathway CNV gain may be a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients."
