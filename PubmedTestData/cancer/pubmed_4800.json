        "Xuanwei is an area of the highest incidence and mortality with lung cancer in China. The aim of this study is to determine serum selenium concentrations in lung cancer patients from Xuanwei as well as selenium levels of cancerous tissues, cancer-adjacent pulmonary tissues, and normal pulmonary lung tissues from lung cancer patients, and the relationship between selenium and the high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei.",
        "One hundred and twenty female adults from Xuanwei were enrolled in the study (60 lung cancer patients and 60 with non-tumor and non-respiratory diseases, respectively) and blood samples were collected. Sixty fresh cancerous tissues and their adjacent as well as normal tissues were collected (31 samples from lung cancer patients living in Xuanwei for more than 2 years and 29 from patients in other regions of Yunnan Province outside of Xuanwei, respectively). Serum and tissue selenium concentrations were assayed using a fluorometric method.",
        "Women with lung cancer had a mean serum selenium value (55.22 \u03bcg/L\u00b113.34 \u03bcg/L) of averagely 8.47%, significantly lower than that in subjects with non-tumor and non-respiratory disease controls (60.33 \u03bcg/L\u00b113.82 \u03bcg/L)(P < 0.05). Selenium concentrations in the tumor tissues (0.105 \u03bcg/g\u00b10.034 \u03bcg/g) were statistically lower than that of normal ones (0.140 \u03bcg/g\u00b10.048 \u03bcg/g)(P < 0.05) from lung cancer patients in Xuanwei. Statistical differences had not been found between the cases from Xuanwei and non-Xuanwei district, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among Stage I, Stage II, stage III groups.",
        "Lower serum selenium state was negatively related to the incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei. It was likely that lower selenium level of lung tissues was potential risk factor to lead to lung cancer."
