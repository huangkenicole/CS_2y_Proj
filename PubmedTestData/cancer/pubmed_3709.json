        "Cancer accounts for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 and is a leading cause of death worldwide. Radiation therapy is an effective modality to cure cancer. The ultimate goal of successful radiation therapy is to accurately deliver a safe and therapeutic dose of radiation to cancerous target cells while limiting radiation to the healthy tissue in the beam pathway and the surrounding normal tissue. With advancing radiation treatment technology, better imaging techniques are imperative for safe, high-dose delivery. Artificial intelligence developments on image-guided radiation therapy technologies, which range from Kilovoltage and Megavoltage modalities to two-dimensional and three-dimensional techniques, are discussed in depth."
