        "N1,N12-Diacetylspermine(DiAcSpm) and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine(DiAcSpd) are excreted in the urine of healthy persons as minor components of urinary polyamine, with small individual variations in amount. They are promising tumor markers, since their excretion is frequently elevated in patients with various types of cancers. DiAcSpm is sensitive in cancer detection, while DiAcSpd is highly specific for cancer. Diacetylpolyamines were initially characterized and determined by HPLC fractionation, followed by enzymatic detection. More recently, antibodies highly specific for DiAcSpm and DiAcSpd were developed, and an ELISA system applicable to the determination of urinary DiAcSpm was established. Measurement of urinary DiAcSpm using this ELISA system revealed that DiAcSpm is a more sensitive tumor marker than CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 for colon and breast cancers. More importantly, DiAcSpm efficiently detects patients at early stages. On the other hand, CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 are quite insensitive for early stage cancers. The urinary DiAcSpm level tends to remain low even in tumor-bearing individuals when their cancerous lesions remain static, while it rises rapidly concomitant with recurrence. DiAcSpm may serve as a prognostic indicator and marker for recurrence of prostate and colon cancers. Diacetylpolyamines may turn out to be general tumor markers, since active proliferation of any cancer tissues would likely be accompanied by activation of polyamine metabolism."
