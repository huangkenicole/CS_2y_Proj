        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the prevalent form of liver cancer in adults and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HCC predominantly arises in the context of cirrhosis as a result of chronic liver disease, injury and inflammation. Full-blown HCC has poor prognosis because it is highly aggressive and resistant to therapy. Consequently, interventions that can prevent or restrain HCC emergence from pre-cancerous diseased liver are a desirable strategy. Histone methylation is a dynamic, reversible epigenetic modification involving the addition or removal of methyl groups from lysine, arginine or glutamine residues. Aberrant activity of histone methylation writers, erases and readers has been implicated in several cancer types, including HCC. In this review, we provide an overview of research on the role of histone methylation in pre-cancerous and cancerous HCC published over the last 5\u00a0years. In particular, we present the evidence linking environmental factors such as diet, viral infections and carcinogenic agents with dysregulation of histone methylation during liver cancer progression with the aim to highlight future therapeutic possibilities."
