        "The cancer mortality and morbidity data over the period of 1999-2003 in Hungary has been analyzed. The attempts for the harmonization of cancer care's organization between European Cancer Centers and Hungarian Cancer Centers will also be reviewed. Total cancer mortality of Hungary was found to be 33 530 persons in 2003. According to the cancer mortality data of 36 European countries the highest mortality rate were in Hungary for male in 1999. Hungary had the second place in the female cancer mortality in Europe. It has also been found that the Hungarian men had the highest rate tobacco related cancers (lung, oral cancers) in Europe. The trends of the cancer mortality for women is changed during the period 1999-2003. In 1999 breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer's death for women followed by colorectal and lung cancers. The lung cancer rates have been rising in Hungarian women and became the main cause of cancer death in 2002. The unfavorable cancer mortality trends in Hungary might be attributed to the high consumption of tobacco and alcohol, moreover the unsatisfactory care of cancer patients. The cancer mortality in Hungary could be reduced by the improvement of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. The European accreditation of the cancer control activities should be based on the network of Cancer Centers in Hungary. This accreditation of the Hungarian Cancer Centers is indispensable for the high quality of the care of cancer patients."
