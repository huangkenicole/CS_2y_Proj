        "Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common form of cancer worldwide, responsible for 25% of cancers in women. Whilst treatment is effective and often curative in early BC, metastatic disease is incurable, highlighting the need for early detection. Currently, early detection relies on invasive procedures, however recent studies have shown extracellular vesicles (EVs) obtained from liquid biopsies may have clinical utility. EVs transport diverse bioactive cargos throughout the body, play major roles in intercellular communication and, importantly, mirror their cell of origin. In cancer cells, EVs alter the behaviour of the tumour microenvironment (TME), forming a bridge of communication between cancerous and non-cancerous cells to alter all aspects of cancer progression, including the formation of a pre-metastatic niche. Through gene regulatory frameworks, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) modulate vital molecular and cellular processes and can act as both tumour suppressors and oncogenic drivers in various cancer types. EVs transport and protect ncRNAs, facilitating their use clinically as liquid biopsies for early BC detection. This review summarises current research surrounding ncRNAs and EVs within BC, focusing on their roles in cancer progression through bi-directional communication with the microenvironment and their diagnostic implications. The role of EV ncRNAs in breast cancer. A representation of the different EV ncRNAs involved in tumourigenic processes in breast cancer. Pro-tumourigenic ncRNAs displayed in green and ncRNAs which inhibit oncogenic processes are shown in red."
