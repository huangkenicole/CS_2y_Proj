        "To investigate the role of histone lysine methylation in normal and cancerous head and neck tissues, which will provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of oncogenesis in these tissues.",
        "Gene expression profiles from histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTases) were obtained from UniGene expressed sequence tags (ESTs). HKMTase expression levels in respective tissues were analyzed for elevated expression or altered levels of normal versus human cancers.",
        "UniGene EST data were derived from normal and cancerous human tissues submitted to UniGene.",
        "The expression levels of 47 HKMTases were obtained for 46 normal and 25 cancerous tissues, which included 10 normal and 5 cancerous head and neck tissues. An analysis of expression levels was carried out to identify HKMTases with tissue-specific expression and alteration in head and neck cancer.",
        "Expression levels of HKMTases in normal and cancerous tissues of the head and neck in comparison with other anatomic sites.",
        "In 7 of 10 head and neck tissues, we identified HKMTases that were specifically elevated in these tissues in comparison with all 46 normal tissues. In all five head and neck cancers, we identified HKMTases specifically elevated in these tumours. In addition, we identitified HKMTases with altered expression in tumour versus normal head and neck tissues.",
        "Normal head and neck tissues have unique epigenetic profiles demarcated by distinct HKMTase gene expression. We identified HKMTases as potentially tissue-specific epigenetic regulators of the head and neck, which could behave as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes important in malignant transformation of these tissues."
