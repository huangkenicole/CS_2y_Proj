        "While cancer is commonly described as \"a disease of the genes\", it is also a disease of metabolism. Indeed, carcinogenesis and malignancy are highly associated with metabolic re-programming, and there is clinical evidence that interrupting a cancer's metabolic program can improve patients' outcomes. Notably, many of the metabolic adaptations observed in cancer are similar to the same perturbations observed in diabetic patients. For example, metformin is commonly used to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, and has been demonstrated to reduce cancer incidence. Treatment with PI3K inhibitors can induce hyperinsulinemia, which can blunt therapeutic efficacy if unchecked. While commonalities between metabolism in cancer and diabetes have been extensively reviewed, here we examine a less explored and emergent convergence between diabetic and cancer metabolism: the generation of lactic acid and subsequent acidification of the surrounding microenvironment. Extracellular lactic acidosis is integral in disease manifestation and is a negative prognostic in both disease states. In tumors, this results in important sequela for cancer progression including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as inhibition of immune surveillance. In diabetes, acidosis impacts the ability of insulin to bind to its receptor, leading to peripheral resistance and an exacerbation of symptoms. Thus, acidosis may be a relevant therapeutic target, and we describe three approaches for targeting: buffers, nanomedicine, and proton pump inhibitors."
