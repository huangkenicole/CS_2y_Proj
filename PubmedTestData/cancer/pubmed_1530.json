        "Cancerous exosomes that carry multiple biomarkers are attractive targets for the early diagnosis and therapy of cancer. As one of the powerful molecular recognition tools, aptamers with excellent binding affinity and specificity toward biomarkers have been exploited to construct various aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) for exosome detection. Here, we review recent advances in aptasensors for the detection of cancerous exosomes. We first discuss the importance and potential of cancerous exosomes in cancer diagnosis and then summarize some conventional aptasensors from the perspective of biomarker recognition and signal collection strategies. Finally, we comment on the outlook for aptasensor research and new directions for cancerous exosome detection."
