        "To analyze the clinical characteristics of multiple primary cancers (MPC) associated with head and neck.",
        "A total of 71 patients with MPC associated with head and neck treated from January 2008 to November 2015 were included in the retrospective study, of them 20 patients were synchronous MPC and 51 patients were metachronous MPC; 45 (63.4%) patients were field cancerization of head neck (FCHN) and 26 (36.6%) patients were non-field cancerization of head neck (NFCHN). For the synchronous MPC patients with an interval of 0 month, the lesion sites of FCHN were treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the site of severe lesion of NFCHN received firstly a standard treatment. Other types of MPC were treated according to international guide lines or experts consensus.",
        "With the mean follow-up of 63.4 months, the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 84.6% and 75.7% respectively. The 3-year and 5-year OS were 56.4% and 37.6% respectively in patients with synchronous MPC, and were 92.2% and 84.2% respectively in patients with metachronous MPC. There was significant difference in the OS between patients with metachronous MPC and patients with synchronous MPC (P=0.0002). The 3-year and 5-year OS were 85.7% and 77.9% respectively in patients with FCHN, and were 82.9% and 72.8% respectively in patients with NFCHN, with no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.297).",
        "With correct diagnosis and effective curative treatment, some of patients with MPC can get long-term survival, showing the better prognosis in metachronous MPC compared to synchronous MPC."
