        "Mediated by chaperon proteins, protein misfolding plays a crucial role in cancer pathogenesis. Chaperonin Containing TCP1 Subunit 3 (CCT3) is one of eight subunits forming eukaryotic chaperons that catalyzes correct folding of the proteins employed in cell division, proliferation, and apoptosis pathway. Moreover, CCT3 expression increases responsively with carcinogenesis. However, how CCT3 drives the cancerous process has not been documented. Here we probed the mechanistic and functional interactions between CCT3 and apoptotic pathways and cell stressors. First, we profiled CCT3 expression levels of different 16\u00a0cell lines and found that CCT3 expression levels of CRL-2329 and PC3 were significantly increased. Then, we suppressed CCT3 levels in CRL-2329 and PC3 lines by miR-24-3p, miR-128-3p, and miR-149-5p mimics, and measured apoptotic response of the cell lines to the knockdown of CCT3 by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V/PI staining, cell-cycle and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) analyses, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement and analysis of expression levels of the apoptotic genes. After having suppressed CCT3, the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase, MMP was impaired, and the intracellular ROS level was increased. These signs of apoptotic flux were corroborated by morphological images, statistically enhanced expression levels of the apoptotic pathway modulators and intracellular free amino acids profile. The free amino acid profile, which is heavily implicated in energy metabolism and cell division, is fluctuated in the progress of canceration. Strikingly, suppressed CCT3 shifted intracellular levels of glutamine, beta-alanine, glycine, serin, asparagine and sarcosine, which are employed in energy metabolism. Consequently, miRNA-mediated CCT3 suppression spur apoptosis by unbalancing the homeostasis in intracellular ROS and the profile of free amino acids in energy metabolism. Taken together, we anticipate that miRNA-mediated CCT3 suppression might provide a \"dual therapeutic strategy\" through conventional cellular toxicity as well as energy withdrawal."
