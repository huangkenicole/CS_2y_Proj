        "Cigarette smoking is responsible for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths. Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases in men and 75% in women. There are about 38 million former cigarette smokers and about 50 million smokers in the United States today. Smoking rates are higher among blacks, blue collar workers, and less educated people. More than 140,000 lives will be lost to cancer each year because of tobacco smoking. All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. It is hoped that public education, smoking cessation programs, and efforts to eliminate carcinogens in the work environment will impact the future incidence of new lung cancer cases. As preventive measures continue, refinement in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer must continue to advance. The recognition of any one of cancer's seven warning signals and prompt subsequent action could lead to earlier detection and a chance for 3- and 5-year survival rates to improve. With medical and research progress, clinical concerns have grown beyond addressing only the patient's physical needs to include important issues such as employment and insurance needs and the psychosocial needs of both the patient and the family as they learn to live with cancer."
