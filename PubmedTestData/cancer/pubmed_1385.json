        "The clinical translation of new cancer theranostic has been delayed by inherent cancer's heterogeneity. Additionally, this delay has been enhanced by the lack of an appropriate in vitro model, capable to produce accurate data. Nanoparticles and microfluidic devices have been used to obtain new and more efficient strategies to tackle cancer challenges. On one hand, nanoparticles-based therapeutics can be modified to target specific cells, and/or molecules, and/or modified with drugs, releasing them over time. On the other hand, microfluidic devices allow the exhibition of physiologically complex systems, incorporation of controlled flow, and control of the chemical environment. Herein, we review the use of nanoparticles and microfluidic devices to address different cancer challenges, such as detection of CTCs and biomarkers, point-of-care devices for early diagnosis and improvement of therapies. The future perspectives of cancer challenges are also addressed herein."
