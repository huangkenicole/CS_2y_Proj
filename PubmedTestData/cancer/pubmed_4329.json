        "Ultrasonically activated surgical devices (USADs) have become indispensable instruments for gastrointestinal surgery. In this study, we investigated the oncological safety of the use of USADs.",
        "We harvested and cultivated the splashes and mist scattered from an USAD when cutting MKN45-derived cancer nodules. Seven days later, we observed viable cancer cells and the total number of cells was counted. The histopathology of the nodules cut by the USAD was also examined.",
        "The existence of viable cancer cells was confirmed by ex vivo cell culture. The number of viable cancer cells was reduced by slow grasping of the USAD. The surface of cancerous tissue cut by the USAD was partially heat-denatured, however, there were some parts in which cancerous tissue was exposed on the surface.",
        "Surgeons should recognize the possibility that cancer cells may be scattered by USAD use."
