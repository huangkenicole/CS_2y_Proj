        "The author explained the definition and its scientific value of \"cancerous toxin\" proposed by Professor Chang-quan Ling, pointing out that it is helpful for better understanding the pathogenic factor and guiding the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In regard to the new definition of \"cancerous toxin\", the author put forward three key issues which should be solved in the field of integrated Chinese and Western medicine. First, the pathological property of cancerous toxin should be uncovered. Second, the relationship between cancerous toxin and syndrome differentiation or dosage of herbs need be further explored. Last, the cause of cancerous toxin is still unknown."
