        "Life is definable as a chemical reaction which obeys exponential growth and dies if reversed. Such a reaction must be the commencement of all life so that every evolved form of it inherits these characteristics. As no single reaction known has these two features, life must be a combination of two or more reactions which whilst obeying all the classical laws of physics and chemistry assume an exponential form and effectively act as being irreversible. The reactions of glutathione--oxidation and reduction--when combined in sequence as a cyclical process fulfill these criteria. The cyclic changes of glutathione from reduced to oxidised to reduced forms must therefore be the reaction which creates life and is responsible for cancer's growth. 434 mHz electromagnetic radiation stimulates cancer growth rate by forcing this cycle into activity. Proof of this hypothesis is the long-term control of cancer in 11 patients treated with oxidised glutathione and 434 mHz radiation. Genetic material does not contain any energy system with exponential form, neither is it self-replicating. Genetic material will only reproduce if placed within an immortal cell in which all controls of the glutathione system have been lost, as in a cancer cell. Oncogenes must be the product of cancer and not the reverse."
