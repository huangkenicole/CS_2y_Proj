        "Approaches to induce tumor differentiation often result in manageable and therapy-na\u00efve cellular states in cancer cells. This transformation is achieved by activating pathways that\u00a0drive tumor cells away from plasticity, a state that commonly correlates with enhanced aggression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Here, we discuss signaling pathways, epigenetics and non-coding RNAs as three main regulatory levels with the potential to drive tumor differentiation and hence as potential targets in differentiation therapy approaches. The success of an effective therapeutic regimen in one cancer, however, does not necessarily sustain across cancer types; a phenomenon largely resulting from heterogeneity in the genetic and physiological landscapes of tumor types necessitating an approach designed for each cancer's unique genetic and phenotypic build-up."
