        "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 18q21 is frequently found in various human cancers, suggesting the presence of tumour suppressor gene(s) in this chromosomal region. DCC is the most likely target of LOH because loss or reduction of DCC expression has been found in many types of cancers. However, few reports have focused on sequence mutations of this gene. We investigated sequence mutations and expression of DCC in primary gastric cancers. We studied mutations in 25 of the 29 DCC exons by PCR-SSCP in 17 primary gastric cancers exhibiting LOH on 18q21. No mutations of DCC were found in any of the tumours, although 78% (47/60) of the primary tumours showed apparent loss or reduction of DCC expression by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of methylation status of DCC revealed that methylation frequently occurred in both primary tumours (75%; 45/60) and corresponding non-cancerous gastric mucosae (72%; 43/60). Methylated status of DCC was significantly correlated with the loss of DCC expression in primary tumours (P< 0.01). These results indicate that DCC is frequently silenced, probably by epigenetic mechanisms instead of sequence mutations in gastric cancer."
