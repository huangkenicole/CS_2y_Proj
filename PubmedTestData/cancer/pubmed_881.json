        "Purpose To validate the recommendation of performing annual follow-up of nonsolid nodules (NSNs) identified by computed tomographic (CT) screening for lung cancer, all cases of lung cancer manifesting as NSN in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were reviewed. Materials and Methods Institutional review board and informed consent were waived for this study. The NLST database was searched to identify all participants with at least one NSN on CT scan with lung cancer as the cause of death (COD) documented by the NLST endpoint verification process. Among the 26 722 participants, 2534 (9.4%) had one or more NSNs, and lung cancer as the COD occurred for 48 participants. On review, 21 of the 48 patients had no NSN in the cancerous lobe, which left 27 patients whose CT scans were reviewed by four radiologists: Group A (n = 12) were cases of lung cancer as the COD because of adenocarcinoma, and group B (n = 15) were cases of lung cancer as the COD because of other cell types. Frequency of lung cancer as the COD because of NSN and the time from randomization to diagnosis within these groups was determined. Results Six of the 12 patients in group A had no NSN in the cancerous lobe whereas the remaining six patients had a dominant solid or part-solid nodule in the lobe that rapidly grew in four patients, was multifocal in one patient, and had a growing NSN in one patient in whom diagnosis was delayed for over 3 years. Five of the 15 patients in group B had no NSN, and for the remaining 10 patients, lung cancer as the COD was not because of NSN. Conclusion It seems unlikely that patients with lung cancer as the COD occurred with solitary or dominant NSN as long as annual follow-up was performed. This lends further support that lung cancers that manifest as NSNs have an indolent course and can be managed with annual follow-up. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2016."
