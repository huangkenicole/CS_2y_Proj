        "Cancer biomarkers can be used to determine the molecular status of a tumor or its metastases, which either release them directly into body fluids or indirectly through disruption of tumor/metastatic tissue. New minimally invasive and repeatable sample collection methods, such as liquid biopsy, have been developed in the last decade to apply cancer knowledge and track its progression. Circulating non-coding RNAs, which include microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs, are increasingly being recognized as potential cancer biomarkers. The growing understanding of cancer's molecular pathogenesis, combined with the rapid development of new molecular techniques, encourages the study of early molecular alterations\u00a0associated with cancer development in body fluids. Specific genetic and epigenetic changes in circulating free RNA (cf-RNA) in plasma, serum, and urine could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for a variety of cancers. Only a subset of these cf-RNAs have been studied in breast cancer, with the most extensive research focusing on cf-miRNA in plasma. These findings pave the way for immediate use of selected cf-RNAs as biomarkers in breast cancer liquid biopsy, as well as additional research into other cf-RNAs to advance."
