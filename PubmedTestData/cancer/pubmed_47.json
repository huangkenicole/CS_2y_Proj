        "There is emerging data suggesting that the non-coding RNA (microRNA 193a or miR-193a) plays key roles in different types of cancers.",
        "This review aims to investigate the functional significance of miR-193a in different cancers according to the information of literature.",
        "All the literature concerning miR-193a in cancer in PubMed are analysed.",
        "Several studies proved the association of miR-193a expression patterns with cancer's stages, grades, response to the chemotherapy and even patient survival. Also, miR-193a can be used to differentiate some types of cancer. In cancer, miR-193a can act as a tumour suppressor gene or as an oncogene. Till now, several genetic factors (MAX, RXR \u03b1, XB130, P63, P73, AEG-1, HIFs, EGFR, Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer) and epigenetic factors (DNA methylation and long non-coding RNAs) were predicted to control miR-193a expression. They have fundamental effects on its biological behaviour in different types of cancers.",
        "miR-193a has significant roles in cancer and can be targeted in the future for cancer therapy by better understanding of the factors that control its biological behaviour."
