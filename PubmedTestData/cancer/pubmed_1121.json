        "At present, cancer is still one of the principal diseases to represent a serious danger to human health. Although research on the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer is progressing rapidly, the current knowledge on this topic is far from sufficient. Some tumors with poor prognoses lack effective prognostic biomarkers.",
        "Firstly, the Wilcoxon test was used to analyse the expression of GTPBP1-GTPBP10 in cancerous and normal tissues. Subsequently, we explored the expression of GTPBP1-10 in cancer by way of a paired t-test and plotted the survival curve using KM and univariate Cox regression analysis to explore the relationship between GTPBP1-10 and the prognosis of cancer. We then explored the significance of the GTPBP family in the tumor microenvironment.",
        "The results showed that many members of the GTPBP family are differentially expressed in a variety of cancers and alter the prognosis of a number of cancers. Members of the GTPBP family may serve as novel prognostic markers for these tumors. Moreover, members of the GTPBP family are correlated with the immune microenvironment of tumors, which is valuable in terms of adding to our understanding of the mechanisms of tumor genesis. Finally, we identified drugs showing a high correlation with GTPBP family members, which are therefore conducive to the development of GTPBP family member-based treatment regimens.",
        "The 10 members of the GTPBP family have prognostic value in multiple tumor types and are associated with the immune microenvironment. Our study may provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors."
