      "AbstractText": [
        "The current standard for diagnosis of skin cancers is visual inspection followed by biopsy and histopathology. This process can be invasive, subjective, time consuming, and costly. Optical techniques, including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS), have been developed to perform non-invasive characterization of skin lesions based on either morphological or biochemical features of disease. The objective of this work is to report a clinical instrument capable of both morphological and biochemical characterization of skin cancers with RS-OCT.",
        "The portable instrument utilizes independent 785\u2009nm RS and 1,310\u2009nm OCT system backbones. The two modalities are integrated in a 4\u2033 (H)\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2033(W)\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2033(L) clinical probe. The probe enables sequential acquisition of co-registered OCT and RS data sets. The axial response of the RS collection in the skin was estimated using scattering phantoms. In addition, RS-OCT data from patients with cancerous and non-cancerous lesions are reported.",
        "The RS-OCT instrument is capable of screening areas as large as 15\u2009mm (transverse) by 2.4\u2009mm (in depth) at up to 8\u2009frames/second with OCT, and identifying locations to perform RS. RS signal is collected from a 44\u2009\u00b5m transverse spot through a depth of approximately 530\u2009\u00b5m. RS-OCT data sets from a superficial scar and a nodular BCC are reported to demonstrate the clinical potential of the instrument.",
        "The RS-OCT instrument reported here is capable of morphological and biochemical characterization of cancerous skin lesions in a clinical setting. OCT can visualize microstructural irregularities and perform an initial morphological analysis of the lesion. The images can be used to guide acquisition of biochemically specific Raman spectra. The two data sets can then be evaluated with respect to one another to take advantage of the mutually complimentary nature of RS and OCT."
