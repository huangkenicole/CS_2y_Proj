        "To explore the role of whole-volume apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based entropy parameters in the preoperative assessment of gastric cancer's aggressiveness.",
        "In all, 64 patients with gastric cancers who underwent 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively included. Regions of interest were drawn manually using in-house software, around gastric cancer lesions on each slice of the diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps. Entropy-related parameters based on ADC maps were calculated automatically: (1) first-order entropy; (2-5) second-order entropies, including entropy(H)<sub>0</sub> , entropy(H)<sub>45</sub> , entropy(H)<sub>90</sub> , and entropy(H)<sub>135</sub> ; (6) entropy(H)<sub>mean</sub> ; and (7) entropy(H)<sub>range</sub> . Correlations between entropy-related parameters and pathological characteristics were analyzed with the Spearman correlation test. The parameters were compared among different pathological characteristics with independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U-test. Additionally, diagnostic performances of parameters in differentiating different pathological characteristics were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.",
        "All the entropy-related parameters significantly correlated with T, N, and overall stages, especially the first-order entropy (r = 0.588, 0.585, and 0.677, respectively, all P < 0.05). All the entropy-related parameters showed significant differences in gastric cancers at different T, N, and overall stages, as well as at different status of vascular invasion (P < 0.001-0.027). And four parameters, including entropy, entropy(H)<sub>0</sub> , entropy(H)<sub>45</sub> , and entropy(H)<sub>90</sub> , showed significant differences between gastric cancers with and without perineural invasion (P 0.006-0.040).",
        "Entropy-related parameters derived from whole-volume ADC texture analysis could help assess the aggressiveness of gastric cancers via analyzing intratumoral heterogeneity quantitatively, especially the first-order entropy.",
