      "AbstractText": [
        "The advent of novel immunotherapies in the treatment of cancers has dramatically changed the landscape of the oncology field. Recent developments in checkpoint inhibition therapies, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, and cancer vaccines have shown immense promise for significant advancements in cancer treatments. Immunotherapies act on distinct steps of immune response to augment the body's natural ability to recognize, target, and destroy cancerous cells. Combination treatments with immunotherapies and other modalities intend to activate immune response, decrease immunosuppression, and target signaling and resistance pathways to offer a more durable, long-lasting treatment compared to traditional therapies and immunotherapies as monotherapies for cancers. This review aims to briefly describe the rationale, mechanisms of action, and clinical efficacy of common immunotherapies and highlight promising combination strategies currently approved or under clinical development. Additionally, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of these immunotherapy approaches as monotherapies as well as in combination with other treatments."
