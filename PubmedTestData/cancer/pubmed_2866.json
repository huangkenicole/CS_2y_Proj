        "Previous studies have reported a significant contribution of NC_000008.10:g.128413305 G>T (rs6983267) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MYC enhancer region to the susceptibility of various cancers. However, the role of rs6983267 SNP in cervical cancer (CC) development and progression has not been demonstrated to date. Therefore, we evaluated the role of rs6983267 SNP in MYC expression in cervical cancers and non-cancerous cervical tissues. In addition, we assessed the role of this SNP in the development and progression of CC.",
        "Using high-resolution melting analysis, we evaluated rs6983267 SNP frequency in women diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n\u2009=\u2009481) and controls (n\u2009=\u2009502) in a Polish Caucasian population. Logistic regression analysis was employed to adjust for the effects of age, parity, oral contraceptive use, tobacco smoking, and menopausal status.",
        "Dividing patients based on clinical characteristics demonstrated an association of the rs6983267 genotype with tumor stage III and grade of differentiation G2 and G3. The p trend value calculated for the rs6983267 SNP in patients with stage III was 0.0006. We also observed a significant contribution of rs6983267 SNP to tumor grade of differentiation G2 and G3. Additional contributors were oral contraceptive use, smoking, and postmenopausal age. We found statistically significant increase of MYC transcript levels in cervical SCC tissues from carriers of the GG vs. T/T (p\u2009<\u20090.00001), G/T vs. T/T (p\u2009=\u20090.0002), and in the non-cancerous cervical tissues from carriers of the GG vs. T/T (p\u2009=\u20090.00046).",
        "The rs6983267 SNP may contribute to the increased MYC expression as well as the spread and rapid growth of cervical SCC as compared to lower grade carcinomas."
