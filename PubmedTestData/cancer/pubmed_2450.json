      "AbstractText": [
        "Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) is a key enzyme involved in biosynthesis of polyamines including spermidine and spermine. The potential function of AMD1 in human gastric cancers is unknown. We analyzed AMD1 expression level in 319 human gastric cancer samples together with the adjacent normal tissues. The protein expression level of AMD1 was significantly increased in human gastric cancer samples compared with their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (P < 0.0001). The expression level of AMD1 was positively associated with Helicobactor pylori 16sRNA (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P < 0.0001), tumor differentiation (P < 0.05), tumor venous invasion (P < 0.0001), tumor lymphatic invasion (P < 0.0001), blood vessel invasion (P < 0.0001), and tumor lymph node metastasis (TNM) stage (P < 0.0001). Patients with high expression of AMD1 had a much shorter overall survival than those with normal/low expression of AMD1. Knockdown of AMD1 in human gastric cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation and cell migration. In a tumor xenograft model, knockdown of AMD1 suppressed the tumor growth in vivo. Inhibition of AMD1 by an inhibitor SAM486A in human gastric cancer cells arrested cell cycle progression during G1-to-S transition. Collectively, our studies at the cellular, animal and human levels indicate that AMD1 has a tumorigenic effect on human gastric cancers and affect the prognosis of the patients."
