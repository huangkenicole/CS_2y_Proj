        "Cancer recurrence is a very real concern for cancer survivors. Surveillance for recurrence and vigilance for development of new cancers are top priorities during follow-up visits after active treatment ends. However, the cancer survivor also is at risk for the development of comorbid conditions. These conditions, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, menopause, decreased bone mass, hypertension, and hypothyroidism, are discussed with their relevance for general health and their relationships to disease-specific cancers. All of these conditions should be routinely addressed as part of the patient's survivorship care when appropriate. The oncology nurse is in a prime position to educate survivors about the risks for these conditions, both through evidence-based practice guidelines specific to each condition and also through the use of a treatment summary and care plan. This article discusses these selected comorbidities and offers strategies for nurses to address them with survivors during follow-up visits. Clinical practice guidelines for comorbidities are included, along with oncology implications and relevance for survivors. Recommendations for modifiable risk factors and healthy living also are included, along with Web sites for survivorship care plans."
