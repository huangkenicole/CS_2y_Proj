        "The purpose of this study was to conduct a longitudinal analysis of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) trajectories for the assessment of cancer's lasting financial impact.",
        "We identified newly diagnosed cancer patients and constructed matched control group of noncancer participants from the 2002-2018 Health and Retirement Study. Outcomes included monthly OOPE for prescription drugs (RX-OOPE_MONTHLY) and OOPE for medical services other than drugs in the past 2\u2009years (non-RX-OOPE_2YR), consumer debt, and new individual retirement account (IRA) withdrawals. Generalized linear models were used to compare OOPEs between cancer and matched control groups. Logistic regressions were used to compare household-level consumer debt or early IRA withdrawal. Subgroup analysis stratified patients by age, health status, and household income, with the low-income group stratified by Medicaid coverage. All statistical tests were 2-sided.",
        "The study cohort included 2022 cancer patients and 10\u200a110 participants in the matched noncancer control group. Mean non-RX-OOPE_2YR of cancer patients was similar to that of participants in the matched control group before diagnosis but statistically significantly higher at diagnosis ($1157, P\u2009<\u2009.001), 2 ($511, P\u2009<\u2009.001) years, 4 ($360, P\u2009=\u2009.006) years, and 6\u2009 ($430, P\u2009=\u2009.01) years after diagnosis. A similar pattern was observed in RX-OOPE_MONTHLY. A statistically significantly higher proportion of cancer patients incurred consumer debt at diagnosis (34.5% vs 29.9%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 2\u2009years after (32.5% vs 28.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.002). There was no statistically significant difference in new IRA withdrawals. Patients experienced lasting financial consequences following cancer diagnosis that were most pronounced among patients aged 65\u2009years and older, in good-to-excellent health at baseline, and with low income, but without Medicaid coverage.",
