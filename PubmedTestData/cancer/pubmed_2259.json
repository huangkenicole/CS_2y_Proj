        "Cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) is applied to relieve symptoms in patients with malignant ascites. We performed a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CART performed on patients with advanced ovarian and peritoneal cancers with massive ascites during the initial treatment.",
        "From April 2018 to July 2020, CART was performed during the initial treatment of 31 patients with advanced ovarian and peritoneal cancers with cancerous ascites. Patient characteristics and clinical information before and after CART were collected. We performed quality of life assessment using the Japanese version of the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-J) 24\u2009h before and after CART.",
        "CART was performed 38 times in 24 patients before or during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 11 times in 11 patients prior to surgery. Four patients underwent CART before primary surgery and before and/or during chemotherapy. Grade 1-2 fever was observed in 18 of 31 cases (58%), and all were controllable by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CART did not adversely affect the main treatment, chemotherapy, or surgery. CART significantly improved the MDASI-J symptom and interference scores within 24\u2009h after the procedure. The symptom and interference scores decreased from 2.4 to 1.8 and from 4.8 to 3.0, respectively.",
        "CART can be safely performed and is useful for symptom relief and improvement of general condition prior to initial surgery and during initial chemotherapy in ovarian and peritoneal cancers. Performing CART at the time of initial treatment may facilitate initiation of the main treatment."
