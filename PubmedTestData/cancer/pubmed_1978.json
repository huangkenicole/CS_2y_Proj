        "Most of the currently used diagnostics for cancerous diseases\u00a0have yet to meet the standards of screening, as they are insufficiently accurate and/or invasive and risky. In this review, we describe the rationale, the progress made to date, and the potential of analysing the exhaled volatile organic compounds as a pathway for enabling\u00a0early diagnosis of cancer and, therefore, for achieving better clinical prognosis and survival rates.\u00a0The review highlights the major advancements made\u00a0in this field,\u00a0from fundamentals, up to translational phases and clinical trials, with a special emphasis on sensing platforms based on nanomaterials. The prospects for breath analysis in early cancerous disease are presented and discussed."
