        "Cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2 (CDR2) has been presumed to be the main antigen for the onconeural antibody Yo, which is strongly associated with ovarian cancer and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). Recent data show that Yo antibodies also target the CDR2-like protein (CDR2L). We, therefore, examined the expression of CDR2 and CDR2L in ovarian cancer tissue from patients with and without Yo antibodies and from various other cancerous and normal human tissues.",
        "Ovarian cancer tissue and serum samples from 16 patients were included in the study (four with anti-Yo and PCD, two with anti-Yo without PCD, five with only CDR2L antibodies, and five without onconeural antibodies). Clinical data were available for all patients. The human tissues were examined by western blot and immunohistochemistry using rabbit CDR2 and CDR2L antibodies.",
        "Ovarian cancers from all 16 patients expressed CDR2 and CDR2L proteins. Both proteins were also present in normal and cancer tissue from mammary tissue, kidney, ovary, prostate, and testis.",
        "CDR2L is present in ovarian cancers from patients with and without Yo antibodies as was shown previously for CDR2. In addition, both CDR2 and CDR2L proteins are more widely expressed than previously thought, both in normal and cancerous tissues."
