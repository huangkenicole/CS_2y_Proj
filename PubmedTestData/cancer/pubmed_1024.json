        "Photodynamic therapy is an exciting area of current research. As discussed in this chapter, some successful clinical applications of this entity have been developed. Selective use of photodynamic therapy currently is of benefit to highly selected patients and holds the potential of help with some problems not currently well treated (like field cancerization). The potential utility of photodynamic therapy coupled with other cancer therapies is very intriguing. The whole area of photodynamic therapy in viral disease is just being opened to clinical investigation. As laser technology improves and as laboratory experience with known photosensitizers continues and new photosensitizers are developed, more significant clinical contributions will surely be made."
