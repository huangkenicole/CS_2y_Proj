        "As described previously by the author in Duplication mitosis in carcinoma (2), the established organoid continuity of cancer depends on duplication mitosis that cannot be converted to a maturation type of mitosis. This unconverted mitosis is based on certain cell conditions that are peculiar to carcinoma and rejects the effect of a maturation factor, which converts the duplication type of mitosis immediately to the maturation type. This cell abnormality must be dependent on the paralysis of a mitotic maturation promoting system (MMPS). In short, therapy aimed at the complete eradication of cancer must focus on this paralysis, rather than on the destruction of the cancerous cell. In the past, this paralysis has been completely neglected, although it does not appear to be an insurmountable subject for study. If this paralysis could be completely recovered, the cancerous cell would lose its duplication mitotic activity and established organoid continuity, thus allowing the genuine eradication of cancer to be achieved in the future."
