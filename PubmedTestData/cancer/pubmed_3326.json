      "AbstractText": [
        "Pixatimod is an inhibitor of heparanase, a protein which promotes cancer via its regulation of the extracellular environment by enzymatic cleavage of heparan sulfate (HS) and non-enzymatic signaling. Through its inhibition of heparanase and other HS-binding signaling proteins, pixatimod blocks a number of pro-cancerous processes including cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Several laboratories have found that these activities have translated into potent activity using a range of different mouse cancer models, including approximately 30 xenograft and 20 syngeneic models. Analyses of biological samples from these studies have confirmed the heparanase targeting of this agent in vivo and the broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects that heparanase blockade achieves. Pixatimod has been tested in combination with a number of approved anti-cancer drugs demonstrating its clinical potential, including with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, sorafenib, platinum agents and an anti-PD-1 antibody. Clinical testing has shown pixatimod to be well tolerated as a monotherapy, and it is currently being investigated in combination with the anti-PD-1 drug nivolumab in a pancreatic cancer phase I trial."
