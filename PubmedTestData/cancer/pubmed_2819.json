        "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and pathological features and prognosis of white lesion of vocal cord. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred and fifty-four cases of white lesion of vocal cord from January 2009 to February 2016 were retrospectively analysed. All the patients had undergone the resection of white lesion of vocal cord resection through retaining laryngoscope under general anesthesia with the specimens pathologically examined. <b>Results:</b> There were 148 males and 6 females in this study. The ages ranged from 36 to 83 years, and the median age was 54.5.There were 103(66.88%) long-term smokers, and 64(41.56%) long-term drinkers. Postoperative pathology showed that chronic mucosal inflammation in 19 cases (12.34%), squamous epithelial hyperplasia in 56 cases(36.36%), mild dysplasia in 25 cases(16.23%), moderate dysplasia in 34 cases(22.08%), severe dysplasia in 12 cases(7.79%), carcinoma <i>in situ</i> in 6 cases(3.90%), and invasive carcinoma in 2 cases(1.30%). The recurrence rate and canceration rate of chronic mucosal inflammation were 0. The recurrence rate of squamous epithelial hyperplasia was 10.71%, the canceration rate was 0.The recurrence rate of mild dysplasia was 8.00%, the canceration rate was 0. The recurrence rate of moderate dysplasia was 20.59%, the canceration rate was 8.82%. The recurrence rate of severe dysplasia was 25.00%, the canceration rate was 16.67%. <b>Conclusions:</b> White lesion of vocal cord is a predominantly male disease. Long-term smokering and drinking are one of common causes. The final diagnosis of white lesion of vocal cord relies on the pathology. Closed observation is necessary for theses dysplasia cases. The majority of which are benign, the operation effect is good."
