        "Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are the most common non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in humans. Their prevalence is higher in immunocompromized patients. Results of some animal experiments have indicated that TNF acts both as a tumour promotor and an inductor of apoptosis.",
        "Peer-reviewed articles about human skin cancers possibly related to TNF antagonists. The occurrence and growth kinetics of NMSC are possibly increased in some patients under TNF antagonist therapy. Other issues of such biological treatment suggested include the activation of other distinct skin malignancies, including malignant melanoma. Benign melanocytic tumours appear to be boosted as well. At present, most of the reported findings only represent anecdotal case reports. The influence of cumulative co-factors must not be neglected, particularly the effect of other therapies administered to the patients. The occurrence of antibodies to some TNF antagonists may decrease both the treatment efficacy and the risk of skin cancer progression.",
        "More research needs to be performed in order to firmly establish and understand the risk of anti-TNF biologicals in the area of human skin cancers. At present, NMSC progression appears to be boosted on areas of skin field cancerization. Benign melanocytic naevi may develop as well."
