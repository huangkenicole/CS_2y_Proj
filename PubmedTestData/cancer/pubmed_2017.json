        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Genome-wide analysis (GWAS) of lncRNAs expression in PTC samples exhibited up and down\u00a0regulation of lncRNAs, thus, acting as tumor promoting oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the\u00a0pathogenesis of PTC by interacting with target genes. For example, lncRNAs such as HOTAIR, NEAT1, MALAT1, FAL1, HOXD-AS1, etc. are overexpressed in PTC in comparison to that of non-cancerous thyroid tissues, which stimulate the pathogenesis of PTC. On the other hand, lncRNAs such as MEG3, CASC2, PANDAR, LINC00271, NAMA, PTCSC3, etc. are down\u00a0regulated in PTC tissues when compared to that of non-cancerous thyroid samples, suppressing formation of PTC. Also, several lncRNAs such as BANCR acts as oncogenic or tumor suppressor in PTC formation depending on which they are interacting with. In addition, lncRNAs expression in patients with PTC associated with clinicopathological parameters such as distance metastasis, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, pathological stage, and response to therapy. Thus, lncRNAs profiles could have the potential to be used as prognostic or predictive biomarker in patients with PTC. Therefore, we describe the microarray method to examine lncRNAs expression in PTC tissue samples, which could facilitate better management of patients with PTC. Furthermore, this method could be fabricated to examine lncRNAs expression in other biological and/or clinical samples."
