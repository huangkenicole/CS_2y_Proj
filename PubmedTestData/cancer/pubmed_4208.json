        "The main objective of this project was to formulate novel decorated amphiphilic PLGA nanoparticles aiming for the selective delivery of the novel peptide (CK-10) to the cancerous/tumor tissue. Novel modified microfluidic techniques were used to formulate the nanoparticles. This technique was modified by using of Nano Assemblr associated with salting out of the organic solvent using K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. This modification is associated with higher peptide loading efficiencies, smaller size and higher uniformity. Size, zeta potential & qualitative determination of the adsorbed targeting ligands were measured by dynamic light scattering and laser anemometry techniques using the zeta sizer. Quantitative estimation of the adsorbed targeting ligands was done by colorimetry and spectrophotometric techniques. Qualitative and quantitative uptakes of the various PLGA nanoparticles were examined by the fluorescence microscope and the flow cytometer while the cytotoxic effect of the nanoparticles was measured by the colorimetric MTT assay. PLGA/poloxamer.FA, PLGA/poloxamer.HA, and PLGA/poloxamer.Tf have breast cancer MDA. MB321 cellular uptakes 83.8, 75.43 & 69.37 % which are higher than those of the PLGA/B cyclodextrin.FA, PLGA/B cyclodextrin.HA and PLGA/B cyclodextrin.Tf 80.87, 74.47 & 64.67 %. Therefore, PLGA/poloxamer.FA and PLGA/poloxamer.HA show higher cytotoxicity than PLGA/ poloxamer.Tf with lower breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell viabilities 30.74, 39.15 & 49.23 %, respectively. The design of novel decorated amphiphilic CK-10 loaded PLGA nanoparticles designed by the novel modified microfluidic technique succeeds in forming innovative anticancer formulations candidates for therapeutic use in aggressive breast cancers."
