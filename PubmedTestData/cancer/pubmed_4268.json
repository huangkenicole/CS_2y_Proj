        "Cancer has become a growing burden in Pakistan in recent times, posing a significant cause for concern. The World Health Organization has reported a steady increase in the incidence of cancer in Pakistan. According to the present study, breast cancer (24.1%), oral cavity (9.6%), colorectum (4.9%), esophagus (4.2%), and liver cancer (3.9%) were the five most prevalent cancers. Males were more likely to have oral cavity cancer (14.9%), colorectum cancer (6.8%), liver cancer (6.4%), prostate cancer (6.0%), and lung cancer (6.0%). In women (41.6%), breast (6.9%), oral cavity (5.5%), cervix (4.7%), and uterus\u00a0cancer (4.1%) were the most common cancers. Middle-aged people (43.0%) were most likely to develop cancer, followed by seniors (30.0%) and adults (20.0%). Children and adolescents were most likely to develop cancers of the central nervous system (CNS), leukemia (18.7%), and Hodgkin (17.3%), followed by breast, oral cavity, colorectum, and prostate at other ages. Most patients were from Punjab (40.4%) and Sindh (32.2%). Approximately 30.0% of patients were diagnosed at stage III and stage IV. In terms of registered cases, breast cancer, oral cavity cancer, colon cancer, esophagus cancer, and liver cancer are among the highest. In the future, this information may prove useful for assessing the effectiveness of interventions."
