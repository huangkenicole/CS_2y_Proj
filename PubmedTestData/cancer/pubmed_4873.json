        "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. LncRNA ROR, is a tumor oncogene associated with various human cancers. However, the role of ROR in colorectal cancer cells still remains unknown. The aim of this study was to measure the expression level of ROR and clarify its biological functions in colorectal cancer cells.",
        "The expression level of ROR in colorectal cancer cells was detected using qRT-PCR. We performed CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, cell migration and invasion assays to evaluate the effects of ROR on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Then, transfection of ROR, ROR inhibitor, miRNA-223-3p-mimics and miRNA-223-3p-inhibitor, qRT-PCR, and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the molecular mechanisms.",
        "In the present study, Lnc-ROR was highly expressed in colorectal cancers compared with adjacent non-cancerous normal tissues. And the expression level of ROR was also increased in colorectal cancer cells (p < 0.05). CCK8 assay and invasion assay suggested that ROR can promote cell proliferation and invasion. The luciferase reporter assay showed ROR acted as sponge and directly competed with miRNA-223-3p, then decreasing the expression of tumor suppressor gene NF2.",
        "The findings of this study first revealed that ROR was upregulated in colorectal cancer cells and can promote cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting tumor suppressor gene NF2 through interacting with miR-223-3p."
