        "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most recurrent cancer, accounting for 80% of all breast cancers worldwide. Originating from the milk duct, it eventually invades the fibrous tissue of the breast outside the duct, proliferation takes 1-2 months for each division. Quinacrine (QC), an FDA-approved small molecule, has been shown to have anti-cancer activity in numerous cancerous cell lines through diverse pathways; ultimately leading to cell death. Here, we have investigated the mode of action of QC in MCF7 cells. This study demonstrated the modulation of cellular cytoskeleton, such as the formation of distinct filopodial and lamellipodial structures and spikes, through the regulation of small-GTPases. We also observed that QC induces a signaling cascade by inducing apoptotic cell death by increasing ROS generation and altering HSP70 expression; which presumably involves ERK regulation. Our findings show that QC could be an attractive chemotherapeutic agent having a \"shotgun\" nature with potential of inducing different signaling pathways leading to apoptotic cell death. This opens new avenues for research on developing QC as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of invasive ductal carcinomas."
