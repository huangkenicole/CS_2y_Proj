        "Population studies can serve as an essential source of information on cancer's etiology, and assessments of cancer trends over time can detect changes. This study aimed to provide statistics over time on cancer incidence and mortality in the Barretos Region, Brazil.",
        "Cancer incidence data were obtained from the population-based cancer registry of the Barretos Region, and mortality data were obtained from the Official Federal Database from 2002 to 2016. Age-standardized rates for incidence and mortality were calculated. Joinpoint Regression software was used to estimate the average annual percentage changes (AAPC).",
        "Age-standardized rates of incidence increased significantly for colon cancer (AAPC: 2.2), rectum and rectosigmoid (AAPC: 2.4), liver (AAPC: 4.7), female breast (AAPC: 2.2), and thyroid cancer (AAPC: 3.8) but decreased for esophageal (AAPC: -3.2), stomach (AAPC: -4.2), lung (AAPC: -2.0), and ovarian cancer (AAPC: -5.6). The mortality increased for liver cancer (AAPC: 2.3) and decreased for pharyngeal cancer (AAPC: -5.8), stomach cancer (AAPC: -6.6), cervical uterine cancer (AAPC: -5.9), prostate cancer (AAPC: -2.4), and ovarian cancer (AAPC: -3.3).",
        "We observed decreases in some cancers related to tobacco smoking and cervical and stomach cancers related to infectious agents, showing strong regional and national prevention programs' successes. But, we also observed rises in many cancer sites linked to lifestyle factors, such as breast or colorectal cancer, without a sign of declining mortality.",
        "These results can impact and support cancer control program implementation and improvement at the community level and extrapolate to the state level and/or the whole country."
