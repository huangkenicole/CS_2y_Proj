        "The trans-anal local excision for lower rectal cancer of early stage may achieve the same therapeutic effect as abdominal resection. This study was to evaluate efficacy of local resection for lower rectal cancer of early stage.",
        "Records of 23 patients with lower rectal cancer of early stage received local excision from Feb. 1989 to Apr. 1999 in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively.",
        "Of the 23 patients,12 were adenocarcinoma, and 11 were canceration of adenoma; 17 with tumor of stage T0, and 6 with tumor of stage T1. Three patients had local recurrence, 2 of 3 were salvaged by trans-anal local excision, and 1 of 3 was treated by abdominoperineal resection. All patients were followed-up for more than 5 years with a 5-year survival rate of 95.65%.",
        "So long as carefully considering indications of trans-anal local excision in treating patients with lower rectal cancer of early stage, good efficacy may be achieved."
