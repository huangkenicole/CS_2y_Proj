        "Cancer is an important cause of mortality in patients on hemodialysis and kidney transplant recipients. Immunodepression and the genotoxic action of uremia are critical pathogenic agents. A 59-year-old man, ex-smoker, who had been on hemodialysis for seven months because of uremic degeneration of diabetic nephropathy, underwent a combined kidney-pancreas transplant in 1991, complicated by slow-resolution CMV infection. In 1993, after kidney graft failure due to chronic rejection, hemodialysis treatment was restarted with good pancreatic function. Steroid therapy was interrupted and azathioprine and cyclosporine immunosuppressive therapy maintained. In September 2007 the patient was diagnosed with two neoplasms of the oral mucosa: a well-differentiated squamous carcinoma and a spinocellular carcinoma associated with field cancerization. The tumors were resected, followed by laser treatment. Histological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma without lymph node involvement. Azathioprine was interrupted. In January 2008 adjuvant radiotherapy to the surgical areas of the oral mucosa and neck was started. In February a verrucous nevus on the patient's chest turned out to be a spinocellular carcinoma in situ. In May 2008 recurrence of keratinizing squamous carcinoma of the oral mucosa was found, this time with nodal involvement. Cyclosporine administration was interrupted and after consultation with the oncology committee it was decided to continue with supportive therapy only, until the patient's death in August 2008."
