      "AbstractText": [
        "LncRNAs are a group of non-coding RNA transcripts with lengths of over 200 nucleotides and can interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins to regulate gene expression of malignant tumors in human tissues. LncRNAs participate in vital processes, such as chromosomal nuclear transport in the cancerous site of human tissue, activation, and the regulation of proto-oncogenes, the differentiation of immune cells, and the regulation of the cellular immune system. The lncRNA metastasis-associated lung cancer transcript 1 (MALAT1) is reportedly involved in the occurrence and development of many cancers and serves as a biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings highlight its promising role in cancer treatment. In this article, we comprehensively summarized the structure and functions of lncRNA, notably the discoveries of lncRNA-MALAT1 in different cancers, the action mechanisms, and the ongoing research on new drug development. We believe our review would serve as a basis for further research on the pathological mechanism of lncRNA-MALAT1 in cancer and provide evidence and novel insights into its application in clinical diagnoses and treatments."
