      "AbstractText": [
        "In recent years, processing bodies (P-bodies) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, have attracted growing scientific attention due to their involvement in numerous cellular activities, including the regulation of mRNAs decay or storage. These cytoplasmic dynamic membraneless granules contain mRNA storage and decay components such as deadenylase and decapping factors. In addition, different mRNA metabolic regulators, including m<sup>6</sup>A readers and gene-mediated miRNA-silencing, are also associated with such P-bodies. Cancerous cells may profit from these mRNA decay shredders by up-regulating the expression level of oncogenes and down-regulating tumor suppressor genes. The main challenges of cancer treatment are drug resistance, metastasis, and cancer relapse likely associated with cancer stem cells, heterogeneity, and plasticity features of different tumors. The mRNA metabolic regulators based on P-bodies play a great role in cancer development and progression. The dysregulation of P-bodies mediators affects mRNA metabolism. However, less is known about the relationship between P-bodies mediators and cancerous behavior. The current review summarizes the recent studies on P-bodies mediators, their contribution to tumor development, and their potential in the clinical setting, particularly highlighting the P-bodies as potential drug-carriers such as exosomes to anticancer in the future."
