      "AbstractText": [
        "The nationwide survey of institutions with MHTS and human dry dock capabilities was analyzed and the following results have been obtained. 1) The relative rates of cancer detection by sex and organ were the stomach > colon > rectum > lung > kidney > esophagus for men and the stomach > breast > uterus > colon > thyroid > lung for women. 2) Gastric cancer takes first place in the ranking of rates of cancer detection in the population of both sexes, followed by colon cancer. The difference in rate of detection between these cancers has been narrowed from year to year. In 1997, the ratio of gastric to colon cancers was 10:7. 3) Early cancers account for 74% of gastric cancer patients and 75% of colon cancer patients. 4) Since gastric and colon cancers are detected early, the proportions of persons with gastrointestinal symptoms are as low as 28% for gastric cancer patients and 26% for colon cancer patients. 5) The relative rates of cancer detection by the degree obesity are normal > obese > lean person. The rates of gastric and colon cancers are 2- and 3-fold higher for obese persons than for lean persons, respectively. Gastric and colon cancers are detected with higher frequency in well-nourished persons. The present review of the national MHTS and human dry dock statistics has confirmed the efficacy of MHTS and human dry dock, especially in the examination for gastrointestinal cancers."
