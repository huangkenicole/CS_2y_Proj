        "The possibility of using minimally invasive analytical instruments to monitor cancerous cells and their interactions with analytes provide great advances in cancer research and toxicology. The real success in the development of a reliable sensor for cell monitoring depends on the ability to design powerful instrumentation that will facilitate efficient signal transduction from the biological process that occurs in the cellular environment. The resulting sensor should not affect cell viability and must function as well as adapt the system to the specific conditions imposed by the cell culture. Due to their performance, electrochemical biosensors could be used as an effective instrument in cell cancer research for studying biochemical processes, cancer development and progression as well as toxicity monitoring. Current research in this direction is conducted through high-throughput, compact, portable, and easy to use sensors that enable measurement of cells' activity in their optimum environment. This paper discusses the potential of a high-throughput electrochemical multisensor system, so-called the DOX system for monitoring cancerous cells and their interaction with chemical toxins. We describe the methodology, experiments, and the operation principle of this device, and we focus on the challenges encountered in optimizing and adapting the system to the specific cell-culture conditions. The DOX system is also compared with conventional cell-culture techniques."
