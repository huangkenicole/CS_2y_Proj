        "Delay in diagnosing breast cancer in lactating women has been considered the reason for poor outcomes. Five women whose breast cancer occurred during lactation are discussed here. All five women were seen by a lactation consultant. Three women presented with lumps in their breasts, one with recurrent mastitis, and one with mastitis-like symptoms. Despite previous reports, their infants willingly suckled on the cancerous breast. The lactation consultant should refer a client to a physician for evaluation if a breast lump is not substantially reduced in size after 72 hours of treatment; if mastitis-like symptoms without fever are not resolved after a 10-day course of antibiotics; if mastitis appears chronically at the same location; and/or if peau d' orange sign appears. Lactation consultants can also be instrumental in encouraging monthly breast self-examinations for lactating women."
