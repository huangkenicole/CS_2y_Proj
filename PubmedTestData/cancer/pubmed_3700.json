        "\u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22M) functions as a chaperon to maintain structural stability of MHC class I complex that is associated with antigen presentation to cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes. Cancerous cells in \u03b22M loss-of-function are thought to avoid immune surveillance. As increased level of \u03b22M present in tissue/serum is significantly associated with tumor status in various cancers, \u03b22M may become an important prognostic and survival factor in a range of malignancies. It is believed that \u03b22M acts as hormone-like molecule to trigger a pleiotropic signaling via a ligand-to-receptor binding mechanism. Anti- \u03b22M monoclonal antibodies successfully induce apoptosis in malignant cells, suggesting a surprising therapeutic approach. Of note, \u03b22M is largely localized in the cytoplasm of advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), in contrast to that in the plasma membrane of normal oral mucosa. This suggests that \u03b22M-derived intracellular signaling might be preceded by its accumulation in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of tumors. Hence, translocation of \u03b22M from cell surface to cytoplasm in advanced tumors may shed light on the mechanism of \u03b22M-mediated tumorigenesis."
