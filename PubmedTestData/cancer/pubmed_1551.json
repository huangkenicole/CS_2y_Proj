        "Cells from five cancer effusions (two ovarian carcinomas, two lung cancers, and one carcinoma of the breast) were analyzed by G-, C-, and Q-banding techniques. The following observations were made: 1) The origin of some marker chromosomes could be traced accurately by these banding techniques. 2) Several chromosomes, which appeared normal with conventional staining techniques, were found to be re-arranged ones and, hence, abnormal. 3) Chromosomes No. 1, No. 3 and No. 11 were the most frequently involved in aberrations, whereas No. 12, No. 13, No. 17-20, and No. 22 Were least frequently involved. Only in one case each was the X chromosome or the Y chromosome involved in aberrations. The Y chromosome was found to be missing in all cancer cells of one lung cancer. 4) Each effusion had characteristic markers, invariably present in each cell, whether the cells were near diploid, or polyploid. 5) No common markers were observed in the two ovarian carcinomas studied, whereas the two lung cancers had a few common markers."
