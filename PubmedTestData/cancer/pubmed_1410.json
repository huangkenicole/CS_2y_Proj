        "Despite its prominent position in today's medical research, popular culture and everyday life, cancer's history is relatively unwritten. Compared to the other great 'plagues'\u00a0-\u00a0cholera, tuberculosis or tropical fevers, to name but a scant handful\u00a0-\u00a0cancer has few dedicated pages in the general surveys, and its specialists have largely failed to convince the broader community of medical historians\u00a0-\u00a0or indeed historians of anything at all\u00a0-\u00a0that histories of the disease can tell us fundamental things about the science and practice of medicine, both past and present. Moreover, cancer has a remarkably stable profile over time, at least in terms of its definition, language and terminology\u00a0-\u00a0a detail that only makes the disease's absence from historical literature more surprising."
