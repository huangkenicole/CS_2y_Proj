        "Radiologic techniques remain the main method for early detection for breast cancer and are critical to achieve a favorable outcome from cancer. However, more sensitive detection methods to complement radiologic techniques are needed to enhance early detection and treatment strategies. Using our recently established culturing method that allows propagation of normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells of luminal origin, flow cytometry characterization, and genomic sequencing, we show that cancer cells can be detected in breast milk. Cells derived from milk from the breast with cancer were enriched for CD49f<sup>+</sup>/EpCAM<sup>-</sup>, CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>, and CD271<sup>+</sup> cancer stem-like cells (CSC). These CSCs carried mutations within the cytoplasmic retention domain of HDAC6, stop/gain insertion in MORF4L1, and deletion mutations within SWI/SNF complex component SMARCC2. CSCs were sensitive to HDAC6 inhibitors, BET bromodomain inhibitors, and EZH2 inhibitors, as mutations in SWI/SNF complex components are known to increase sensitivity to these drugs. Among cells derived from breast milk of additional ten women not known to have breast cancer, two of them contained cells that were enriched for the CSC phenotype and carried mutations in NF1 or KMT2D, which are frequently mutated in breast cancer. Breast milk-derived cells with NF1 mutations also carried copy-number variations in CDKN2C, PTEN, and REL genes. The approach described here may enable rapid cancer cell characterization including driver mutation detection and therapeutic screening for pregnancy/postpartum breast cancers. Furthermore, this method can be developed as a surveillance or early detection tool for women at high risk for developing breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings describe how a simple method for characterization of cancer cells in pregnancy and postpartum breast cancer can be exploited as a surveillance tool for women at risk of developing breast cancer."
