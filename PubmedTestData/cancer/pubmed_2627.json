      "AbstractText": [
        "During the time interval from January 1978 to January 2003, total of 128 chordotomy procedures have been done due to cancer's pain at the Institute of neurosurgery in Clinical Centre of Serbia. That pain has been mostly of uncontrolled intensity and it was resistant on applieed conservative treatment. Bilateral chordotomy has been performed in 6 patients only in exceptional cases when fixed paraplegia has proved; unilateral chordotomy has been performed in 122 cases. Bilateral chordotomy is much more dangerous than unilateral one because of greater posibility of appearance of motor deficits, sphincteral disturbances or subsequent formed pain. This procedure has several negative aspects. Firstly, it is an opened surgical intervention in general anesthesia and therefore, there is no communication with patient. We had a habit to perform DREZ surgery rather than chordotomy when ever it has been indicated. In 80.1% of all cases, the successfulness of surgery has been marked as excellent, in 15.2% of all cases, it has been marked as good, and in 4.7% of all cases, bad outcome has been detected. The rate of complication was 4.4%."
