        "To identify and review the recent literature on clinical applications, outcome, and new developments in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of head and neck cancer.",
        "Although PDT and surgery have a similar local control and recurrence rate, the gold standard of treatment for early-stage oral cavity cancer remains local surgery with, on indication, concurrent treatment of the neck. PDT proves its value in treatment of patients with field cancerization and patients with superficial recurrence after previous surgery and/or radiation, in whom surgical salvage would entail important morbidity. PDT is also promising as an adjuvant treatment after surgery in the presence of macroscopic or microscopic involved margins, in patients where reresection or reirradiation would imply an unacceptable risk. Recent progress in the field of PDT focuses on development and clinical application of new photosensitizing agents, photochemical internalization, and photoimmunotherapy.",
        "The value of PDT in specific well-selected head and neck cancer clinical scenarios is well established. The basic research field is rapidly evolving and experimental findings are promising, maybe eventually leading to optimized results, less side-effects, and more indications."
