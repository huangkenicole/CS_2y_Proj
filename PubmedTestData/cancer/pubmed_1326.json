        "In normal mitosis, the two daughter cells are identical to each other. However, in the case of duplication mitosis of the non-matureable cancerous stem cell, the two daughter stem cells must be non-visually, but certainly different from each other in order to allow for the characteristic type of cancerous cell turnover development. One of these daughter stem cells is matureable and normally activated by the maturation factor, then undergoes maturation mitosis and finally passes through its lifespan. However, the other daughter stem cell is non-matureable and not activated by the maturation factor. It undergoes the original mitosis again, reproducing two daughter stem cells that differ from each other: te above matureable cell and the original non-matureable cell (Fig.). Such a hetero-duplication type of mitosis is peculiar to carcinoma and responsible for the oncogenesis. The origin of this mitosis is most probably an unequal division of a mitotic maturation promoting system (MMPS) at the mitotic phase, and may be dependent on some abnormal supplement of the MMPS. Thus, therapy aimed at the complete eradication of cancer should focus on removal of this supplement from the cancerous cell."
