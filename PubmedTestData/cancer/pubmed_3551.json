        "Breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers alter the zinc (Zn) metabolism. Combined analyses of urinary Zn concentrations [Zn] and Zn stable isotope compositions (\u03b466Zn)\u00a0may provide a non-invasive approach for tracing malignancy-induced Zn dyshomeostasis. In this study, we measured [Zn] and \u03b466Zn\u00a0in urine from prostate (n\u00a0=\u00a022), breast (n\u00a0=\u00a016), and from women with benign breast disease (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and compared those with age-matched healthy controls (22-49 years or 50+ years) and published data for pancreatic cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a017). Our results show that cancer-induced changes are reflected in higher urinary [Zn] and lower urinary \u03b466Zn\u00a0for pancreatic and prostate cancer and benign breast disease when compared with healthy controls. For prostate cancer, the progression of low [Zn] and high \u03b466Zn for patients of low-risk disease toward high [Zn] and low \u03b466Zn for the higher risk patients demonstrates that [Zn] and \u03b466Zn\u00a0in urine could serve as a reliable prognostic tool. Urinary excretion of isotopically light Zn by patients with prostatic and pancreatic cancer is probably the result of increased reactive oxygen species in cancerous cells, which limits the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and thus facilitates the oxidation of metalloproteins with sulfur-rich ligands. Urine from breast cancer patients shows undistinguishable \u03b466Zn\u00a0to healthy controls, implying that the expression of metalloproteins with sulfur-rich ligands is stronger in breast cancer tissues. In conclusion, urinary \u03b466Zn\u00a0may provide a non-invasive diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer and support disease prognosis for prostate cancer. These findings should translate to comprehensive transverse and longitudinal cohort studies in future."
