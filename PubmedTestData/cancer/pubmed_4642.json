        "Of the 3,907 cases of primary head and neck or lung cancer diagnosed between 1961 and 1984, 94 patients were identified with a history of cancer at both sites. The total incidence of lung cancer in our head and neck cancer patients was 5.4 percent. Of the 94 patients, 73 had both cancers diagnosed at our institution. These 73 patients were further analyzed. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 63 percent of the lung cancers. Twenty of the lung cancers were synchronous and 47 were metachronous after head and neck cancer. Of the synchronous lung cancers, 50 percent were postoperative stage I, whereas only 11 percent of the metachronous cancers were postoperative stage I. The lung cancer survival rate was significantly better for the synchronous cancer group at 5 years (34 percent) than for the metachronous cancer group (5 percent). The better survival rate was evidently due to the greater proportion of early-stage lung lesions. The relatively large number of advanced-stage lung lesions in the metachronous cancer group suggests that aggressive screening of head and neck cancer patients for lung cancer may detect more metachronous lung cancers at an earlier stage and thus improve the survival rate of these patients."
