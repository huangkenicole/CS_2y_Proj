        "To investigate the clinical and prognostic characteristics of patients with esophageal cancer and multiple primary cancers.",
        "Patients with esophageal cancer frequently have multiple primary cancers, the presence of which may complicate physicians' decision-making because the clinical and prognostic features of such patients remain unknown.",
        "This retrospective single-institution study included 538 consecutive patients who had undergone resection of esophageal cancer. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality.",
        "At the time of surgery, 163 patients (30%) had multiple primary cancers (77, metachronous; 86, synchronous). Multiple primary cancers were significantly associated with alcohol use and tobacco smoking (Brinkman index). Patients with synchronous cancers had significantly shorter overall survival than those without multiple primary cancers (log-rank P = 0.032; univariate HR = 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.17, P = 0.040; multivariate HR: 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.36; P = 0.020). Patients with metachronous cancers had similar prognoses to those without multiple primary cancers. The prognostic effect of synchronous cancers on overall survival was particularly prominent in patients with Stage I esophageal cancer (log-rank P = 0.0002).",
        "Multiple primary cancers are associated with a history of tobacco and alcohol use, supporting the concept of field cancerization. Synchronous multiple primary cancers may be an independent predictor of poorer long-term survival in patients undergoing resection of esophageal cancers."
