        "Until now cancerogenesis has been studied in close relation with the corresponding malignant phenotype. Such unified approach defines cancer as uncontrolled cellular multiplication, associating invasion and metastasis. Contrary to the classical approach, this paper presents cancerous disease from two distinct perspectives: cancerogenesis as the cause (investigated especially to cellular or molecular level), and malignant phenotype as the resulting effect (with supracellular evolution). It is advanced the perspective that exacerbated cell division in cancer would be actually a very responsive event to supracellular signals, which are received from extracellular matrix and supracellular programs of the body."
