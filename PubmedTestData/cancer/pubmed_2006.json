        "Kinesin family protein 2A (KIF2A), an M-type nonmotile microtubule depolymerase, has attracted attention for its role in carcinogenesis and poor prognoses in various human cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of KIF2A and its robustness and potential to predict clinical outcomes in gastric cancer (GC) patients. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of KIF2A was determined in 24 pairs of cancerous and adjacent nontumor tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry of KIF2A was performed on a tissue microarray composed of 461 GC and 65 matched adjacent nontumor tissues removed during surgeries and 18 chronic gastritis, 15 intestinal metaplasia, and 37 low-grade and 62 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias acquired through gastric endoscopic biopsies. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to perform survival analyses. The high KIF2A expression was significantly correlated to histological type, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. A negative correlation was found between KIF2A expression and the 5-year survival rate of GC patients. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that KIF2A is an independent prognostic factor in GC. This study demonstrated the high KIF2A expression might serve as an independent marker for poor prognoses in GC patients."
