      "AbstractText": [
        "A 69-year-old female patient with type 2 advanced gastric cancer (s-T4N0M0H0Cy0P0, f-Stage IIIA) located from lower corps to antrum underwent a distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphandectomy in May 2006. After surgical treatment, S-1+ docetaxel combined chemotherapy was started for pEM (+) due to direct invasion to pancreas head as the first-line chemotherapy. However, the local recurrence whose diameter was 24 mm at pancreas head was detected with enhanced CT in December 2006. Moreover, nevertheless CPT-11+CDDP combined chemotherapy or paclitaxel monotherapy as the second or the third-line chemotherapy, respectively, the diameter of the local recurrence enlarged to 38 mm in November 2007. Therefore, chemo-radiotherapy using with S-1 and CDDP was started in December 2007 and the diameter of local recurrence was reduced to 25 mm in January 2008. No adverse event of grade 3 or more occurred during chemo-radiotherapy except for grade 3 of neutropenia. Chemo-radiotherapy for this gastric-cancer patient with local recurrence of multiple anti-tumor drug resistance was effective and safe."
