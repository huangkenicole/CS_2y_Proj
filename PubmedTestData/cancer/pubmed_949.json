        "New cancer incidences worldwide will eclipse 18 million in 2019, with nearly 10 million cancer-related deaths. It is estimated that in the United States, almost 40% of individuals will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Surgical resection of primary tumors remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment; however, the surgical process can trigger an immune-suppressing sympathetic response, which promotes tumor growth of any residual cancerous cells post surgery. Regional and local anesthesia have become staples of anesthesia and analgesia during and after surgery. Recently, much evidence in the form of retrospective and prospective studies has come to light regarding the protective, antitumor properties of anesthetic and analgesic agents across a wide variety of cancers and patient demographics. It is believed that by blocking afferent pain signals, the body does not mount the sympathetic response that contributes to the perpetuation of disease after surgical treatment. This review, therefore, investigates these studies as they pertain to the treatment and outcomes of cancers treated surgically to elucidate the role of regional anesthesia in the propagation of cancer."
