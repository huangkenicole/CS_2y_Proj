        "The positive expression rate of Livin in ovary endometriosis cancerous tissues (68%) was obviously higher than that in ovary endometriosis tissues (36%) and benign tumor tissues (13%)( <i>P</i><0.05). The positive expression rate of PTEN in ovary endometriosis cancerous tissues (16%) was obviously lower than that in ovary endometriosis tissues (65%) and benign tumor tissues (80%)( <i>P</i><0.01). There was no correlations between positive expressions of Livin and age, clinical stage, grading, histological type and lymphatic metastasis of ovary endometriosis cancer ( <i>P</i>>0.05), the same result was also found for PTEN. Livin and PTEN expression presented an obviously negative correlation in ovary endometriosis cancer ( <i>r</i>=-0.559, <i>P</i>=0.001).",
