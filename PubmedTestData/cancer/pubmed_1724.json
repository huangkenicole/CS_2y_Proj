        "The multi-step process of carcinogenesis implies the existence of pre-malignant yet\u00a0altered states that involve both the potentially carcinogenic cell as well as its surrounding microenvironment. Experts discuss some tumor types for which clear pre-cancerous stages have been identified and mention key biological alterations used for diagnosis and intervention strategies."
