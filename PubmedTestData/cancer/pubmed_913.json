        "The link between cancer and inflammation is specific transcription factors that once activated have the capacity to enhance expression of genes that are common to both the regulation and the production of mediators of inflammation, and also to the regulation of the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Cellular pathways activated by chronic inflammation brought about by chronic infections, by immune-mediated diseases, or by dysregulated wound healing at sites of repetitive tissue injury, constitute risk factors for initial cell transformation and for cancer progression. In established cancers, the cancer cells induce development of an exaggerated inflammatory state in the stroma, which in turn promotes cancer growth, invasion and metastasis. Inflammatory cells of myeloid origin in the tumour-associated stroma, mediate suppression of immune responses against cancer cells, which suppression favours tumour growth. Oral submucous fibrosis, and to a lesser extent oral lichen planus are precancerous conditions in which immuno-inflammatory processes are implicated in their pathogenesis, and in their cancerous transformation, if it occurs. Although there is some evidence for an association between oral squamous cell carcinoma on the one hand and dento-gingival bacterial plaques and chronic periodontitis on the other hand, the role of inflammation as the sole cause of cancerous transformation in such cases is not proven. The purpose of this article is to elaborate on some of the more important relationships between oral cancer and inflammation, and to comment on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma."
