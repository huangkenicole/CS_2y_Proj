        "Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1) is highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including prostate, breast and ovarian. However, the relationship between SR-B1 and lung adenocarcinoma is unknown. We analyzed the expression of SR-B1 in a well-characterized lung adenocarcinoma tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry, in 90 cancerous and 90 adjacent normal lung tissues. Results showed that the positive expression rate of SR-B1 in cancer tissues (86/90, 96%) was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues (50/90, 56%) (P\u200a<\u200a.001). And SR-B1 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma tissue was significantly higher than that of adjacent normal tissue (P\u200a<\u200a.001), accounting for 67% of cases. This elevated SR-B1 expression was associated with AJCC stage (P\u200a<\u200a.001), T stage (P\u200a=\u200a.012), N stage (P\u200a=\u200a.002), and lymph node positivity (P\u200a<\u200a.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high SR-B1 expression had a shorter overall survival (P\u200a<\u200a.001). On the multivariate analysis, SR-B1 was an independent prognostic factor for outcomes after adjustment for other prognostic factors (P\u200a=\u200a.038). In conclusion, high SR-B1 expression is associated with conventional pathologic parameters that represent tumor aggressiveness and may purport a poor clinical prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma."
