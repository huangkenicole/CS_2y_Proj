        "Cancer, as a major cause of mortality, is highly related to alterations in the structure and behavior of cells of cancerous tissues. The invasive nature of cancer cells is correlated with their increased traction force, high deformability and altered cell adhesion. These changes are directly attributed to the remodeling of cell cytoskeleton mostly in actin structure. While microtubules and intermediate filaments are mostly involved in mechanical properties of cytoskeleton, actin fibers actively contribute to not only mechanical properties, but also other aspects. Hence study of actin mechanics assists in a deeper understanding of cancer related events. Here, with a biomechanical perspective, we describe the cytoskeleton changes in cancer onset and progress in fiber and protein levels, with focus on actin structure in terms of content and arrangement. Cytoskeleton remodeling and particularly alterations in the content and arrangement of actin structure, highly influence cell mechanical properties, force generation and adhesion potentials."
