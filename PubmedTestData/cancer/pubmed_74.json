        "miR-29 family is one of the small noncoding RNAs and has a very important role in many physiologic and pathologic functions through regulating the target genes that play roles in various bioprocesses such as proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Thus, we aim to survey the potential of the miR-29 family in normal model and development and progression of malignancy in this study. In addition, the potential role of miR-29 family has been studied as the clinical marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many cancers as the potential targets to treat cancer. Moreover, it was stated in summary that the herbal compounds can regulate miR-29 family in cancers. Therefore, regulating the expression of the miR-29 family in a variety of cancers can be a new strategy to obtain better results from cancerous patients' treatment in the future."
