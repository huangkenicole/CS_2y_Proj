        "<i>CYP24A1</i> polymorphisms may affect predisposition of cancer, but the results of published studies remain inconclusive. Therefore, the authors conducted this meta-analysis to more robustly assess relationships between <i>CYP24A1</i> polymorphisms and the predisposition of cancer by pooling the findings of published studies.",
        "A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and CNKI was endorsed by the authors to identify eligible studies; 17 studies were finally found to be eligible for pooled meta-analysis.",
        "The pooled meta-analysis results showed that genotypic frequencies of the rs4809960 polymorphism among cancerous patients and controls of Caucasian ethnicity differed significantly, and genotypic frequencies of the rs6022999 polymorphism among cancerous patients and controls of Asian ethnicity also differed significantly. Moreover, we found that genotypic frequencies of the rs2585428 polymorphism among patients with prostate cancer and controls differed significantly, and genotypic frequencies of the rs6068816 polymorphism among patients with prostate cancer/breast cancer and controls also differed significantly.",
        "This meta-analysis suggests that the rs4809960 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of cancer in Caucasians, and the rs6022999 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of cancer in Asians. Moreover, the rs2585428 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of prostate cancer, while the rs6068816 polymorphism may affect the predisposition of prostate cancer and breast cancer."
