        "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers worldwide with a high mortality rate. Prognosis remains poor even in this era of advanced medicine mainly due to early metastasis and invasion. The present study aimed to explore and validate predictors of distant metastasis and prognosis in pancreatic cancer. In our preliminary experiment, we established a novel metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC\u2011M8 from parent BxPC\u20113 cells. Via whole genome sequencing, RT\u2011qPCR, western blotting, migration and invasion assays, we initially found that BxPC\u2011M8 shared similar biological characteristics to BxPC\u20113, but only differed in enhanced metastatic and invasive capabilities with a significant increase in collagen type\u00a0VI \u03b11\u00a0chain (COL6A1) expression. Knockdown of COL6A1 via small interfering RNA led to a significant decrease in migration and invasion of BxPC\u2011M8 cells, suggesting suppressed epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, a significant increase in COL6A1 expression was observed in cancerous tissue compared with paracancerous tissue (40.7\u00a0vs\u00a03.7, P=0.001). Additionally, its expression was observed to be significantly associated with distant metastasis and vascular invasion at the time of surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that COL6A1 expression (hazard ratio\u00a01.90, 95%\u00a0confidence interval 1.04\u20113.47, P=0.037) is an independent predictor of overall survival\u00a0(OS). The median OS observed for COL6A1+ and COL6A1\u2011 patients was found to be 8\u00b14 and 14\u00b17\u00a0months (P=0.021), respectively. Of note, we identified that COL6A1 expression in tissue samples was associated with significantly reduced OS (P=0.001), demonstrating that COL6A1 may serve an important role in the metastatic process and could be considered as a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that COL6A1 could be an indicator of distant metastasis and a valid prognostic predictor in such patients; however, further investigation is required."
