        "The biological tissue could be considered as a porous matrix filled with the interstitial fluid. The tumoral tissue has a different permeability from the healthy tissue. With regard to this knowledge, the main objective of the present study is to study the tissue permeability as a diagnostic parameter for the detection of breast cancer. To this end, the healthy and the cancerous specimens of the breast tissue are taken from 17 female cases. All cancerous tumors are in the vascular phase of the growth. The samples undergo a uniaxial compression test by a robotic system while the strain rate is set to remain unchanged. Using the stress and the strain rate data, the strain-dependent permeability is determined, which is an exponential function of the strain level. The permeability function is identified by the initial permeability at the zero compressive strain and a material constant. Results show that the initial permeability of the healthy breast tissue is significantly different from the corresponding value for the cancerous tissue. For all cancerous samples, the permeability is less than the healthy tissue samples; as 40-70% reduction in the initial permeability is observed compared to the healthy breast tissue. The evaluation of the permeability between the healthy and the cancerous specimens is accompanied by the biopsy reports and observing structural images of the specimens using environmental scanning electron microscope. Based on the results, the permeability is suggested to have a diagnostic application for the detection of vascular breast tumors."
