        "Background Diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are lacking. Recent studies have demonstrated that circulating long non-coding RNAs have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the detection of cancers. We analyzed the significance of lncRNAs 91H, PVT-1 and MEG3 in the detection of CRC. Methods We examined the expression levels of 13 candidate lncRNAs in the plasma of 18 CRC patients and 20 non-cancerous controls. Then, we validated our findings by determining the expression levels of six promising lncRNAs in CRC tissues and normal colorectal tissues. Finally, we evaluated the clinical relevance of lncRNAs 91H, PVT-1 and MEG3 in the plasma of 58 CRC patients and 56 non-cancerous controls. Results Our data revealed that the expression levels of lncRNAs 91H, PVT-1 and MEG3 were significantly higher in plasma samples from CRC patients than in those from non-cancerous controls. The combination of 91H, PVT-1 and MEG3 could discriminate CRC patients from non-cancerous controls with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.877 at a cut-off value of 0.3816, with a sensitivity of 82.76% and 78.57% specificity. More importantly, the combination of lncRNAs shows more sensitivity in the detection of early-stage CRC than the combination of CEA and CA19-9, biomarkers currently used for CRC detection (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Conclusions lncRNAs 91H, PVT-1 and MEG3 are promising diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage CRC."
