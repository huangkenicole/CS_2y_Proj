        "Cancer is a generic term for a variant manifestation of life caused by genetic mutations of somatic cells. It is not only carcinogenesis which is basically a genetic phenomenon, but also tumor progression which can be influenced by various genetic factors. A group of tumors is known to be inherited in a Mendelian fashion. In addition a great number of single gene disorders is associated with the development of maligne tumors. The further study of these diseases will allow new insights into the fundamental mechanisms leading to clinical cancer. In this respect a series of immunodeficiency diseases is of particular interest. Several organ tumors which seem to occur more frequently in relatives of tumor patients are of practical importance. A more sophisticated classification of these tumors may illuminate their genetic behavior. The geneticist cannot only define groups of individuals with a high cancer risk, but he can identify genetic, e.g. chromosomal, aberrations of cancerous cells which enables him the early detection of neoplasia."
