      "AbstractText": [
        "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer and is associated with an increased lifetime risk of gastric and duodenal cancers of 8-16% and 7%, respectively; therefore, we aim to describe an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) surveillance program for upper gastrointestinal (GI) precursor lesions and cancer in LS patients.",
        "Patients who either had positive genetic testing or met clinical criteria for LS who had a surveillance EGD at our institution from 1996 to 2017 were identified. Patients were included if they had at least two EGDs or an upper GI cancer detected on the first surveillance EGD. EGD and pathology reports were extracted manually.",
        "Our cohort included 247 patients with a mean age of 47.1\u00a0years (SD 12.6) at first EGD. Patients had a mean of 3.5 EGDs (range 1-16). Mean duration of follow-up was 5.7\u00a0years. Average interval between EGDs was 2.3\u00a0years. Surveillance EGD detected precursor lesions in 8 (3.2%) patients, two (0.8%) gastric cancers and two (0.8%) duodenal cancers. Two interval cancers were diagnosed: a duodenal adenocarcinoma was detected 2\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months after prior EGD and a jejunal adenocarcinoma was detected 1\u00a0year, 9\u00a0months after prior EGD.",
        "Our data suggest that surveillance EGD is a useful tool to help detect precancerous and cancerous upper GI lesions in LS patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine a program of surveillance EGDs in LS patients. More data are needed to determine the appropriate surveillance interval."
