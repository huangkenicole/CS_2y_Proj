        "We analyzed the influence of cytology development to frequency of precancerosa (Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 - CIN 3) and cervical cancer. The number of examined Pap smears increased significantly in the analyzed period. The calculated linear trend shows an average four-year increase of 17,283.35 smears. The number of detected CIN 3 increased accordingly. The calculated linear trend shows an average four-year increase by 45.03 and decrease of the rate of 0.07. A slight increase in cervical cancer was also noticed. The calculated linear trend shows an average four-year increase in cancer by 1.6 and decrease in the rate of 0.51. Analyses of cervical cancer by stages showed an increase in number of stage I and decrease of other stages. The calculated linear trend shows an average four-year increase of stage I by 4.94 or decrease in other stages of cervical cancer of 3.29 respectively. The rate of cervical cancer stage I decreased by 0.11 and of other stages by 0.39. Further analyses of the stage I showed that the linear trend of IA stage had an average four-year increase by 5.40 and decrease in stage IB of 0.48. The rate of the cervical cancer stage IA increased by 0.02, whereas the rate of IB decreased by 0.13. Cytology development in our country has resulted in detection of higher number of CIN 3 and the earliest stage (IA) of cervical cancer whereas the number of other stages (IB, II, III, IV) has decreased. However, a total number of cervical cancers haven't changed over the whole period. Thus, it is obvious that opportunistic program of detection, which has been using in Croatia, could not decrease frequency of cervical cancer. In order to achieve it, well-organized national program of detection is needed."
