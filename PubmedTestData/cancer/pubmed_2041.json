        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and mostly cannot be translated into proteins. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing of various cell types has enabled the annotation of tens of thousands of lncRNAs in human genome. Varying levels of evidence supports the implications of lncRNAs in the onset and progression of cancers. Ubiquitin is an evolutionarily conserved protein and could post-translationally mark a number of proteins. The most important proteolytic role of ubiquitination is degradation of substrate proteins by the 26S proteasome. Compiling evidences demonstrated that lncRNAs are involved in the accurate execution of protein stability programs via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In the current review, we systematically summarize the detailed mechanisms how lncRNAs modulate ubiquitination of target proteins, regulate cancerous signaling pathways and control tumorigenesis of gastrointestinal cancers. Although there are still considerable studies on unraveling the complicated interactions between lncRNAs and proteins, we believe that lncRNAs are promising but challenging molecules which may strongly facilitate precision cancer therapeutics in the future."
