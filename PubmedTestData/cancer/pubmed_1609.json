        "Cancer is the most dreadful disease increasing rapidly causing an economic burden globally. A standardized chemotherapy regimen planned with curative intent weakens the immune system and damages healthy cells making the patient prone to infections and severe side effects with pain and fatigue.",
        "Astragalus membranaceus (AM) has a long history of use in the treatment of severe adverse diseases. For thousands of years, it has been used in mixed herbal decoctions for the treatment of cancer. Due to growing interest in this plant root for its application to treat various types of cancers and tumors, has attracted researcher's interest.",
        "The literature search was done from core collections of electronic databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct using keywords given below and terms like pharmacological and phytochemical details of this plant.",
        "Astragalus membranaceus has demonstrated the ability to modulate the immune system during drug therapy making the patient physically fit and prolonged life. It has become a buzzword of herbalists as it is one of the best of seven important adaptogenic herbs with a protective effect against chronic stress and cancer. It demonstrated significant amelioration of the perilous toxic effects induced by concurrently administered chemo onco-drugs.",
        "The natural phytoconstituents of this plant formononetin, astragalus polysaccharide, and astragalosides which show high potential anti-cancerous activity are studied and discussed in detail. One of them are used in clinical trials to overcome cancer related fatigue. Overall, this review aims to provide an insight into Astragalus membranaceus status in cancer therapy."
