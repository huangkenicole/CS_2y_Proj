        "Differences in the FA composition of subcellular fractions from healthy and cancerous kidney tissues from the same patients were examined. Only minor differences in CLA content were found between the healthy and the cancerous tissue portions. Regarding the distribution pattern, CLA incorporation into nuclei and cytosol was significantly higher than incorporation into plasma membranes and mitochondria, which could be correlated to the neutral lipid content of these fractions. The subcellular distribution pattern of CLA was similar to that observed with monounsaturated FA but unlike that found with 18:2n-6, which underlines the different physiological properties of CLA and 18:2n-6. Because PUFA have been suggested to have an effect on cancer risk, the contents of n-3 and n-6 PUFA were determined in kidney and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The 18:2n-6 content and delta5 desaturase activity were significantly lower, and the 18:3n-6, 20:3n-6, and 20:5n-3 contents and delta6 desaturase activity were significantly higher in RCC than in healthy renal tissue, indicating a changed PUFA metabolism in RCC. Previous research has suggested that CLA inhibits the elongation and desaturation of 18:2n-6 into 20:4n-6. In that case, one might speculate that a diet enriched in CLA would be a useful tool in preventing RCC. However, the involvement of CLA in preventing renal cancer could not be demonstrated definitively from the design of this experiment. Further understanding of the cause and/or consequence of the difference in FA metabolism may lead to a better understanding of RCC."
