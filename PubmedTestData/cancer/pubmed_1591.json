      "AbstractText": [
        "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has received attention as a mitogen because the physiologically active lipid stimulates ovarian cancer cell growth by interacting with specific receptors, the endothelial cell differentiation gene (EDG) family. In the present study, we have investigated the expression of EDG-7 mRNA, part of the EDG family, in both human ovarian cancers and established human ovarian cancer cell lines.",
        "RNA was extracted from six ovarian cancer cell lines and multiple cancerous and normal ovarian tissues. The expression of EDG-7 mRNA was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting, using reduced glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and S26 as internal controls.",
        "Of the cell lines tested, EDG-7 mRNA was expressed most intensely in CRL-11731 and CRL-1572 and at a lesser but still substantial level in CRL-11732. The expression of EDG-7 mRNA was limited in MCAS, CRL-11730 and TYKnu. In the ovarian cancer tissues, EDG-7 mRNA was expressed most highly in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and serous cystadenocarcinoma. The expression of EDG-7 mRNA was limited in clear cell adenocarcinoma and undetectable in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.",
        "The intense EDG-7 expression in ovarian cancers suggests that the relation between LPA and EDG-7 (an LPA receptor) is involved in cancer cell growth and proliferation in some histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer."
