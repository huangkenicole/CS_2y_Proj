        "Cancer's hallmark feature is its ability to evolve, leading to metastasis and recurrence. Although genetic mutations and epigenetic changes have been implicated, they don't fully explain the leukocytic traits that many cancers develop. Cell fusion between cancer and somatic cells, particularly macrophages, has been suggested as an alternative pathway for cancer cells to obtain new traits by acquiring exogenous genetic material.",
        "This study aims to investigate the potential biological outcomes of tumor-myeloid cell fusion by generating tumor-macrophage hybrid cells. Two clones with markedly different tumorigenicity were selected, and RNA-seq was used to compare their RNA expressions with that of the control cells. Based on the results that the hybrid cells showed differential activation in several upstream regulator pathways that impact their biological behaviors, the hybrid cells' abilities to recruit stromal cells and establish angiogenesis as well as their cell cycle distributions were investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies.",
        "Although both hybrid clones demonstrated p53 activation and reduced growth rates, they exhibited distinct cell cycle distributions and ability to grow in vivo. Notably, while one clone was highly tumorigenic, the other showed little tumorigenicity. Despite these differences, both hybrid clones were potent environmental modifiers, exhibiting significant abilities to recruit stromal and immune cells and establish angiogenesis.",
        "The study revealed that tumor-somatic cell fusion is a potent environmental modifier that can modulate tumor survival and evolution, despite its relatively low occurrence. These findings suggest that tumor-somatic cell fusion could be a promising target for developing new cancer therapies. Furthermore, this study provides an experimental animal platform to investigate cancer-myeloid fusion and highlights the potential role of tumor-somatic cell fusion in modulating the tumor environment."
