        "Canine cancer, a significant cause of mortality in domestic dogs, is a powerful comparative model for human cancers. Revealing genetic alterations driving the oncogenesis of canine cancers holds great potential to deepen our understanding of the cancer biology, guide therapeutic development, and improve cancer management in both dogs and people. Next generation sequencing (NGS) based-diagnostic panels have been routinely used in human oncology for the identification of clinically-actionable mutations, enabling tailored treatments based on the individual's unique mutation profiles. Here, we report the development of a comprehensive canine cancer gene panel, the Canine Oncopanel, using a hybridization capture-based targeted NGS method. The Canine Oncopanel allows deep sequencing of 283 cancer genes and the detection of somatic mutations within these genes. Vigorous optimization was performed to achieve robust, high-standard performance using metrics of similar cancer panels in human oncology as benchmarks. Validation of the Canine Oncopanel on reference tumour samples with known mutations demonstrated that it can detect variants previously identified by alternative methods, with high accuracy and sensitivity. Putative drivers were detected in over 90% of clinical samples, showing high sensitivity. The Canine Oncopanel is suitable to map mutation profiles and identify putative driver mutations across common and rare cancer types in dogs. The data generated by the Canine Oncopanel presents a rich resource of putative oncogenic driver mutations and potential clinically relevant markers, paving the way for personalized diagnostics and precision medicine in canine oncology."
