Breast cancer's survival rate is at an all-time high, increasing the number of people who will be living with such issues on a daily basis and shifting the focus from acute care concerns to chronic disease concerns.",
        "Healthcare providers should assess individual patients for potential issues they may face. By identifying problems, they can challenge health care to focus on the long-term problems associated with sexuality and intimacy issues facing patients."
