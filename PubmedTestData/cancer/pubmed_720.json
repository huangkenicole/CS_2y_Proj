        "The macroscopical and histological features of 4,428 cases of gastric cancer resected stomachs was noted.d surgically between 1953 and 1974 were studied. Of these cases, 81.9% were in an advanced stage and 18.1% in an early stage. The following changes were observed. (1) In the group of advanced cancers, a gradual decrease in the frequency of Borrmann II type was noted. Most of these tumors were well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. (2) In the group of early cancers, a gradual increase in the proportion of \"cancerous erosion\" was detected. The majority of these tumors were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas or infiltrating signet-ring cell cancers. (3) At intervals of 10 years, 5-10% decrease in the frequency of intestinal metaplasia in resected stomachs was noted."
