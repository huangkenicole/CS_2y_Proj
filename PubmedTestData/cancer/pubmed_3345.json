        "The vaping of electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) has recently emerged as a popular alternative to traditional cigarette smoking, but its association with bladder cancer (BC) risk remains to be established. BC patients exhibit high rates of recurrent disease, possibly as a consequence of the field cancerization effect. We have shown that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (BCEVs) can permanently alter recipient urothelial cells in predisposed fields such that they become fully transformed malignant cells. To model the role that BCEVs may play in this potentially oncogenic setting, we treated TCCSUP BC cells with cigarette smoke extract, unflavored E-liquid, or menthol flavored E-liquid. Those treated BCEVs were then tested for their tumorigenic potential. We found that these smoking- and E-cigarette-related BCEVs were able to promote oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and DNA damage in recipient SV-HUC urothelial cells. Strikingly, menthol E-liquid-induced BCEVs significantly increased rates of malignant urothelial cell transformation. While further in vivo validation of the simultaneous effects of E-liquid and E-liquid-induced BCEVs on field cancerization is needed, these data highlight the possibility that E-cigarettes may compound user risk in a manner that can contribute to higher rates of BC incidence or recurrence."
