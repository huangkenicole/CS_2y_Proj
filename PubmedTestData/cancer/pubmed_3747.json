        "This report describes the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in treating patients with widespread superficial premalignant and malignant lesions, primary and second primary, nonresponsive residual or recurrent cancers in head and neck. Twelve patients whose disease was at T1 stage responded completely. Severe dysplasia and field cancerous lesions involving a large area of oral mucosa (3 cases) also yielded excellent results. Average disease-free period was 13.6 months. The longest survival period was 2 years. All patients as mentioned are still alive without any relapse or recurrence. Combined PDT with other treatment was required to control T2-3 carcinomas. PDT adjunct, however, permitted the prescription of conventional treatment, i.e. radiotherapy or surgery, in a less morbid manner. No unacceptable treatment complications and skin photosensitivity were observed in this study. This indicated the potential role of PDT in the management of long-standing problems in head and neck cancers."
