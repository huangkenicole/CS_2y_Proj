        "Although they are influenced by genetics, most human cancers are not inherited. However, genetic changes in cells are now believed to be the primary initiating factors that lead to cancer development. Although scientists have an increasingly better understanding of the relationship between genetics and cancer, nurses are not as well informed. There is now great potential to improve early detection and treatment of cancer; morbidity and mortality also will decrease as a result. However, this newly gained knowledge is not without its problems. Ethical dilemmas for both society and individuals are likely to arise. Becoming well-informed individuals will help to prepare nurses for cancer care in the future."
