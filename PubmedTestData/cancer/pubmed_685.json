        "Twenty-eight patients with synchronous esophageal and head and neck epidermoid cancers have been treated by a combined protocol including esophagectomy. Seventy-nine percent received pre-operative chemotherapy, 50% had resection of the head and neck lesion at the same time as the esophagectomy and 79% received post-operative irradiation. Two patients died during the post-operative period (7%), and 1, 2 and 3-yr survival rate (Kaplan-Meier) was respectively 64, 32 and 27%. Contrary to our initial assumption, there was no significant decrease in survival compared to patients operated on for an isolated esophageal cancer. The patients were divided into 4 very simple prognostic groups based on the T and N stages of the clinical pre-therapeutic TNM classification: T1 or T2 for esophageal lesions and different T or N stages according to the prognosis for head and neck lesions. A study of each group tended to show that esophagectomy was beneficial except in cases of synchronous T2 esophageal cancer and locally advanced head and neck cancer (there was 2-yr survival in this group). The 28 patients studied represent a particular population which presented 91 cancerous localisations during the duration of the study (mean: 3.25 localisations per patient)."
