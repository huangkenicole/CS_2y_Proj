        "Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) is a rare variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with unique clinicopathological characteristics, a high recurrence rate, and metastatic potential. It will be truly devastating when it occurs as a second wave in a cancer survivor. Despite the multidisciplinary approach in the management of oral SCC, the incidence of second malignancies or multiple carcinomas has been constantly reporting in the literature. Although radiotherapy has saved the lives of countless cancer patients, its several serious late effects are well-documented in the literature, making it a double-edged sword. Radiation epidemiology studies revealed an increased risk of developing radiogenic second cancers after 5 or more years. The purpose of this article is to document a case of SpCC arising in a patient after a span of 5 years who was previously diagnosed and treated with radiotherapy for well-differentiated SCC."
