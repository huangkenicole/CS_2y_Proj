        "To characterize the expression patterns of HDAC7 in patients with gastric cancer and evaluate the prognostic value of HDAC7 in gastric cancer.",
        "The expression of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) was detected in paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples from 86 patients by immunohistochemistry, and the differences in the expression of HDAC7 between cancerous and corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. The correlation between HDAC7 expression and Ki-67 expression or clinicopathologic characteristics was evaluated using a Spearman rank correlation test. Prognostic outcomes that correlated with HDAC7 were examined using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. Moreover, the effects of HDAC7 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells were investigated in vitro using human gastric carcinoma AGS cells.",
        "We found that HDAC7 was downregulated in cancerous gastric tissues (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0019). However, the expression of HDAC7 in cancerous gastric tissues positively correlated with Ki-67 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0325) and distant metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). Moreover, overall survival was shorter for patients expressing higher levels of HDAC7 in cancerous tissues (P\u00a0=\u00a00.042). Mechanistically, the disruption of the HDAC7 gene attenuated the capacity of cell growth, migration and invasion and induced G0/G1 arrest in AGS cells. Conversely, forced ovperexpression of HDAC7 promoted cell growth, migration and invasion and G1/S transition in AGS cells.",
        "These results indicate that high HDAC7 expression in cancerous gastric tissues correlates with distant metastasis and predicts a poor prognosis for patients with gastric cancer."
