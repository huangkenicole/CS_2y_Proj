        "The presence and role of microbes in human cancers has come full circle in the last century. Tumors are no longer considered aseptic, but implications for cancer biology and oncology remain underappreciated. Opportunities to identify and build translational diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics that exploit cancer's second genome-the metagenome-are manifold, but require careful consideration of microbial experimental idiosyncrasies that are distinct from host-centric methods. Furthermore, the discoveries of intracellular and intra-metastatic cancer bacteria necessitate fundamental changes in describing clonal evolution and selection, reflecting bidirectional interactions with non-human residents. Reconsidering cancer clonality as a multispecies process similarly holds key implications for understanding metastasis and prognosing therapeutic resistance while providing rational guidance for the next generation of bacterial cancer therapies. Guided by these new findings and challenges, this Review describes opportunities to exploit cancer's metagenome in oncology and proposes an evolutionary framework as a first step towards modeling multispecies cancer clonality.
