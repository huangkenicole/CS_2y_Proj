        "Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is rapidly becoming an impediment to continuing survival gains seen in breast cancer patients. Drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier is the main issue hindering systemic therapy against BCBM. This review details recent advances in nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery systems to target BCBM. Their primary benefits are: enhanced circulating and intra-BCBM drug biodistribution, BCBM targeting through NP functionalization, opportunities for gene manipulation and their theragnostic applications. Multiple NPs have been synthesized to deliver therapeutic HER2 blockade, which is particularly important given HER2-positive breast cancer's tendency to form BCBM. Finally, we review the clinical context in which NP-based therapeutics have been investigated in BCBM patients. While a breakthrough in improving patient outcomes remain awaited, these clinical trials represent positive steps in the changing attitude towards BCBM as a treatable illness. Although multiple challenges remain in the clinical translation of BCBM-directed NP therapies, ongoing research in the field offers promising avenues for novel targeting of this devastating disease."
