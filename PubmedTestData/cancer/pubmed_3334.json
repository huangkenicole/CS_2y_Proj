        "We recently noticed in nonpolypoid adenomas (NPA) and the adjacent normal mucosa, nondysplastic crypts in symmetric and asymmetric fission (NDCSAF).",
        "All NDCSAF found in 80 small NPA and in the adjacent mucosa were registered.",
        "A total of 178 NDCSAF (mean, 2.2) were found: 12 (6.7%) interspersed between adenomatous glands, 36 (20.2%) partially replaced by dysplastic epithelium, and 130 (73%) underneath the adenomatous tissue. Of the 61 cases with normal mucosa adjacent to NPA, 40 (65.6%) disclosed NDCSAF, and the remaining 21 (34.4%) normal crypts, exclusively.",
        "The accruing of NDCSAF within NPA and surrounding mucosa, are outstanding findings. Given that colonic crypts may undergo only one fission every 30-40 years, the accruing of NDCSAF in and about small NPA reveals mucosal hubs with pathological aberrations of cryptogenesis, probably conveyed by somatic mutations. The findings support the existence of field cancerization in the colonic mucosa."
