      "AbstractText": [
        "Plenty of evidence has recently shown that various inflammatory activities at the local tissue, organ, or even the whole body (systemic) level are strongly linked to many life-threatening chronic diseases, most notably various cancers. However, only very limited information is available for making good use of our supporting immune-modulatory therapeutics for the treatment of cancers. This may result from a lack of studies on specific remedies for efficacious control or modulatory suppression of inflammation-related cancerous diseases. Our group and laboratories were fortunate to have initiated and consistently pursued an integrated team-work program project, aimed at investigating selected medicinal herbs and the derived, purified phytochemical compounds. We focused on the study of key and specific immune-signaling mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels. We were fortunate to obtain a series of fruitful research results. We believe that our key findings reported herein may be helpful for proposing future thematic and integrated research projects that aim to develop future phytochemical drugs against cancers. The mechanisms of the cellular and molecular systems involved in inflammation are becoming increasingly recognized as keystones for the development of future therapeutic approaches for many chronic and cancerous diseases. Recently, the immune checkpoint inhibitors such as antibodies against PD-1 and/or PD-L1 have been shown to be too expensive for general clinical use, and their effects far from optimal, often showing little or no effect or only short-term efficacy. These results point to the need for developing future immune-regulatory or modulatory therapeutics."
