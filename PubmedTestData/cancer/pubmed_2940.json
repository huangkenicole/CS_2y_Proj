        "To investigate the expressions of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene and protein in breast cancer, and understand its clinical significance.",
        "Reverse transcription-PCR, immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of COX-2 in 30 cancerous tissues, paired tissues adjacent to breast cancers and 6 normal tissues far from neoplasm.",
        "Strong expression of COX-2 mRNA was detected in 86% of breast cancers with range of 0 - 1.180 with reference to the expression of beta-actin gene, and increased expression in paired tissues adjacent to cancers with range of 0 - 0.652, but nearly no expression in normal tissues. There were significant difference expression of COX-2 mRNA between cancers and paired tissues adjacent to cancers or normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that COX-2 were expressed in 80% malignant epithelial cells, and 58% of paired tissues adjacent to cancers, no expression in normal tissues.",
        "Expressions of COX-2 gene and protein elevated not only in most human breast cancers, but also in paired tissues adjacent to cancers. Up-regulation of COX-2 is relatively early event in mammary carcinogenesis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of human breast cancer."
