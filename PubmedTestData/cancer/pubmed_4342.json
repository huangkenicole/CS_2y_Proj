        "In a case/control study of 8059 matched pairs, the effect of maternal exposure to drugs and illnesses during pregnancy on the relative risk (RR) of cancer in the child was investigated using conditional logistic regression techniques. Acute respiratory infections, particularly viral infections such as influenza, were associated with a significantly increased RR of all childhood cancers and of neoplasms of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) in particular, (RR = 1.69 all cancers, RR = 1.81 RES neoplasms, RR = 1.59 solid cancers). An analysis of illnesses according to their physiological effects yielded a significant association between childhood leukaemia and febrile illnesses (RR = 1.27 RES neoplasms). A significant increase in RR was associated with maternal history of epilepsy (RR = 1.31 all cancers) rather than with exposure to anticonvulsant drugs. Vaccines showed a pattern of RR similar to that of acute viral infections. Consumption of antipyretics and analgesics significantly increased the RR of childhood cancer (RR = 1.36 all cancers). An analysis of drugs according to their metabolic reactions yielded a significant association between those undergoing amino acid conjugation (predominantly antipyretics and analgesics) and childhood cancer risk (RR = 1.76 solid cancers)."
