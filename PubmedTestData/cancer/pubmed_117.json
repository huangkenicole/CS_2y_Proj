        "Histological inspection of visually normal tissue adjacent to neoplastic lesions often reveals multiple foci of cellular abnormalities. This suggests the presence of a regional carcinogenic signal that spreads oncogenic transformation and field cancerization. We observed an abundance of mutagenic reactive oxygen species in the stroma of cryosectioned patient tumor biopsies, indicative of extratumoral oxidative stress. Diffusible hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was elevated in the conditioned medium of cultured skin epithelia at various stages of oncogenic transformation, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production increased with greater tumor-forming and metastatic capacity of the studied cell lines. Explanted cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also had higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> secretion compared with normal fibroblasts (FIBs). These results suggest that extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as a field effect carcinogen. Indeed, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated keratinocytes displayed decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and increased Src activities because of oxidative modification. Furthermore, treating FIBs with CAF-conditioned medium or exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in the acquisition of an oxidative, CAF-like state. In vivo, the proliferative potential and invasiveness of composite tumor xenografts comprising cancerous or non-tumor-forming epithelia with CAFs and FIBs could be attenuated by the presence of catalase. Importantly, we showed that oxidatively transformed FIBs isolated from composite tumor xenografts retained their ability to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness when adoptively transferred into new xenografts. Higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by CAFs was contingent on impaired TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to the suppression of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). Finally, we detected a reduction in Smad3, TAK1 and TGF\u03b2RII expression in a cohort of 197 clinical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) CAFs, suggesting that impaired stromal TGF\u03b2 signaling may be a clinical feature of SCC. Our study indicated that CAFs and cancer cells engage redox signaling circuitries and mitogenic signaling to reinforce their reciprocal relationship, suggesting that future anticancer approaches should simultaneously target ligand receptor and redox-mediated pathways."
