        "To probe the value of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) messenger RNA in monitoring canceration of liver cells and for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by researching the types of GGT messenger RNA (GGTmRNA) in liver tissues and peripheral blood of different hepatopathy.",
        "The three types of GGTmRNA (A, B, C) in liver tissues and peripheral blood from the patients with HCC, noncancerous hepatopathy, hepatic benign tumor, secondary carcinoma of liver, and healthy persons were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",
        "(1) In normal liver tissues, type A was predominantly found (100.00 %), type B was not found, type C was found occasionally (25.00 %). (2) The distribution of types of GGTmRNA in liver tissues with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatopathy was similar as in normal liver tissues (P>0.05), but type B was found in 3 of 18 patients with chronic hepatitis (16.67 %), and also in 3 of 11 patients with cirrhosis (27.27 %). (3) There was no significant difference of types of GGTmRNA between liver tissues with hepatic benign tumor, secondary carcinoma of liver and normal liver tissues (P>0.05). (4) Type B was predominant in cancerous tissues with HCC (87.5 %), the prevalence of type B in cancerous tissues was significantly higher than that in normal liver tissues (0/12) (P<0.05), but the prevalence of type A in cancerous tissues (46.88 %) was significantly lower than that in normal liver tissues (100.00 %) (P<0.05), and the prevalence of type C (6.25 %) in cancerous was the same as that in normal liver tissues (25.00 %) (P>0.05). In noncancerous tissues of livers with HCC, the main types were type A and type B, the prevalence of type A (85.71 %, 90.48 %) and type C (14.29 %, 9.52 %) in noncancerous tissues of liver with HCC was similar as that in normal liver tissues (A: 100.00 %; C: 25.00 %) (P>0.05), but the prevalence of type B (80.95 %, 76.19 %) in noncancerous tissues of livers with HCC was significantly higher than that in normal liver tissues (0/12) (P<0.05). (5) The prevalence of type B (37.5 %) in peripheral blood with HCC was higher than that in normal person (0/12) (P<0.05). In peripheral blood, type B was found in 4 of 11 cases of HCC with serum AFP negative.",
        "The shift of types of GGTmRNA from A to B in liver tissues may be closely related to the development of HCC, and the analysis of GGT gene may provide a useful tool for early diagnosis of HCC."
