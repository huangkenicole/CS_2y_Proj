        "131 colorectal cancers, less than 3 cm in diameter, experienced at Juntendo University Hospital in Oct. 1977 through Dec. 1988 were studied with respect to their radiological and macroscopic features. Macroscopic features of the cancers were classified into type a (a lesion with a long stalk), type b (a subpedunculated or sessile lesion), type c (a plaque-like lesion) and type d (a lesion with a depression). Type a is early cancer. An early cancer of type b was mostly demonstrated as a lobular pattern of tumor surface, and an advanced cancer as a nodular pattern. Type c less than 1 cm in diameter was seen a sm cancer. A sm cancer of type d was mostly demonstrated as a faint barium fleck of the depression, an advanced cancer as a mild barium fleck. By deformed colonic wall in profile view, an early cancer was mostly demonstrated as a thorn shape deformity, sm or pm cancer as an arch shaped deformity and a cancer with deeper cancerous invasion than pm as a trapezoid deformity."
