        "To evaluate the feasibility of using autofluorescence bronchoscopy after sputum examination for early detection of large airway lung cancer and factors associated with the presence of cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions among smokers with silicosis.",
        "Subjects at the pneumoconiosis clinic were recruited if they fulfilled the following criteria: 1) age \u226540 years, 2) smoking history of \u226520 pack-years and 3) confirmed diagnosis of silicosis. Sputum specimens were collected for cytology/cytometry examination and autofluorescence bronchoscopy was performed in subjects with an abnormal sputum result.",
        "A total of 48 subjects were recruited during the study period. The mean age and smoking history were respectively 63 \u00b1 10 years and 51 \u00b1 30 pack-years. Intraepithelial lung cancers and pre-neoplastic lesions (squamous metaplasia or above) were detected in respectively 2 (4.2%) and 14 (29.2%) subjects. The proportions of current smokers (75.0% vs. 40.6%, P = 0.03) and asbestos exposure (37.5% vs. 9.4%, P = 0.04) were significantly higher in subjects with the above lesions compared with those without.",
        "Sputum examination followed by autofluorescence bronchoscopy may be a useful way of identifying cancerous/pre-cancerous lesions among silicotic smokers. Current smoking and asbestos exposure were associated with these lesions."
