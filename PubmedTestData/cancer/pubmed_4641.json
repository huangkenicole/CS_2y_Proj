        "Most scientific literature reports that aging favors the development of cancers. Each type of cancer, however, initiates and evolves differently, and their natural history can start much earlier in life before their clinical manifestations. The incidence of cancers is spread throughout human life span, and is the result of pre- and post-natal aggressions, individual susceptibility, developmental changes that evolve continuously throughout an individual's life, and time of exposure to carcinogens. Finally, during human senescence, the incidence declines for all cancers. Frequently, the progression of cancers is also slower in aged individuals. There are several possible explanations for this decline at the tissue, cell, and molecular levels, which are described here in. It is time to ask why some tumors are characteristic of either the young, the aged, or during the time of a decline in the reproductive period, and finally, why the incidence of cancers declines late during senescence of human beings. These questions need to be addressed before the origin of cancers can be understood."
