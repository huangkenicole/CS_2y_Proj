        "Alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), as a small heat shock protein, has been found to be highly expressed in various human cancers and significantly associated with the unfavorable prognosis of these tumor. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of CRYAB in gastric cancer (GC) angiogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the expression of CRYAB and CD34 in GC tissues and corresponding normal gastric specimens to explore whether high level CRYAB is related with the angiogenesis and the poor prognosis in GC.In this study, the expression of CRYAB and CD34 were detected in GC tissues and corresponding normal gastric tissues by immunohistochemical (IHC) technique. Furthermore, the relationship of CRYAB with CD34-evaluated microvessel density (MVD) and poor prognosis was also investigated.CRYAB expression level was significantly higher in GC tissue than in normal gastric mucosa tissue, and clearly mean higher MVD was observed in tumor tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. Besides, higher MVD value was observed in positive CRYAB expression group than in negative CRYAB expression group. Statistical analysis showed that CRYAB and MVD are associated with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor differentiation, invasion depth, and TNM stages. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate survival analysis indicated that high expression of CRYAB, MVD, invasion depth, TNM stages, and tumor differentiation, as well as LNM significantly correlate with poor prognosis of GC patients.High expression of CRYAB may contribute to angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of GC. These results indicated that CRYAB was expected to be a promising molecular marker for poor prognosis and potential therapeutic target in patients with GC."
