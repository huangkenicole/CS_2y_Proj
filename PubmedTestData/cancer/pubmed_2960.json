        "Abrogated mitotic progression is a common hallmark of cancer. UbcH10, one of the components of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitotic progression. Abnormal UbcH10 activity is reported in certain types of human cancers; its overexpression is occasionally encountered in cancerous tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. Current studies have suggested the critical role of UbcH10 in the spindle assembly checkpoint and the subsequent accurate separation of sister chromatids, which is orchestrated by a series of molecular interactions governed by the complex and diverse cell cycle machinery. To validate the potential role of UbcH10 in cell proliferation in cancer, we have analyzed the clinicopathological relevance of UbcH10 in progression of breast cancer using a combinatorial approach of human tumor arrays and biochemical analyses. Our results show that the percentage of tested samples which stained positive for UbcH10 in breast cancer tissues is significantly higher compared to the adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Furthermore, results from the clinicopathological analysis have revealed that elevated expression of UbcH10 is associated with higher histological grade tumors. In addition, depletion of UbcH10 by RNA interference in breast cancer cells resulted in decreased cellular proliferation, while overexpression of UbcH10 significantly enhanced cellular growth in breast cancer. Our results suggest a pathological correlation between UbcH10 and cell proliferation in breast cancer. Thus, aberrant UbcH10 activity may induce the dysfunction of proper cell cycle progression and result in the aggressive behavior of tumor cells in patients with breast cancer."
