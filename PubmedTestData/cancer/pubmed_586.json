        "To study the syndrome evolution law of Chinese medicine (CM) in the patients with gastric mucosal dysplasia.",
        "Three hundred and twenty four gastric mucosal dysplasia patients with deficiency and excess correlation syndromes were enrolled by a multi-center collaboration for two years' clinical follow-up to detect the levels of tumor supplied group of factors (TSGF) and carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA).",
        "Among the 324 cases, 29 cases turned cancer in the two years, and the canceration rate was 9.0%. The three syndromes with higher canceration rate were the damp-heat accumulating Wei syndrome concurring or combining with asthenia-cold in Pi and Wei syndrome for 16.7%; stagnation in Wei collaterals syndrome concurring or combining with asthenia of both qi and yin syndrome for 13.2%; stagnation of Gan and Wei qi syndrome concurring or combining with asthenia-cold in Pi and Wei syndrome for 8.0%, respectively. Among the three syndromes, the highest level of TSGF occurred in the former two syndromes. In the half year before carcinogenesis, the syndromes of the patients took on deficiency and excess concurrent syndromes, and the deficiency syndromes involving the qi and blood deficiency syndrome and the Shen deficiency syndrome accounting for 48.0%.",
        "Gastric mucosal dyspalsia canceration syndromes took on the polymorphism of excess and deficiency concurrent syndromes and had the characteristics of deficiency syndromes involving qi and blood deficiency syndrome and Shen-yin-yang deficiency syndrome."
