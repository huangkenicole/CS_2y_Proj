        "Leiomyosarcoma of the vulva is a rare gynecologic malignancy, comprising approximately 1% of vulvar cancers.",
        "A 36-year-old woman was referred for a slowly growing painless vulvar mass that was initially thought to be a Bartholin's duct cyst but was cancerous upon biopsy. A modified radical vulvectomy was performed, and pathology revealed a grade 1 leiomyosarcoma. Thirteen months later, the tumor had not recurred.",
        "Vulvar cancer must be considered in patients with a suspected Bartholin duct cyst that demonstrates atypical features. A biopsy should be obtained if the mass appears firm or solid on palpation, is ulcerated or presents in a slightly different location from the usual area of the Bartholin gland."
