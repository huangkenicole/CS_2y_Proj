        "As evidence accumulates on the risk factors for cancer, it is becoming clearer that employers can play a significant role in the fight against the disease by creating a workplace conducive to lowering health risks. The CEO Roundtable on Cancer's CEO Cancer Gold Standard Program defines what companies can do to prevent cancer, detect it early, and ensure access to the best available treatments for those who are afflicted with the disease. This article describes how Johnson & Johnson incorporated the Cancer Gold Standard Program into its existing health promotion initiatives. Then, a framework is proposed that employers can use to monitor progress in cancer prevention and treatment enhancement efforts. Finally, health care eligibility, claims, and health risk assessment data are analyzed to quantify Johnson & Johnson's progress since implementation of the Cancer Gold Standard Program. Companies interested in initiating or furthering their health promotion efforts should consider joining groups such as the CEO Cancer Gold Standard. Collectively, companies have the ability to influence policy makers, payers, and the industry at large in changing behaviors and creating a culture of health and wellness in the fight against cancer."
