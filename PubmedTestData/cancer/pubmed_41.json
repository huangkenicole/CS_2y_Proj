        "Cancer is a leading cause of increased morbidity and mortality worldwide despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment. Lack of early detection and diagnosis of different cancers and adverse effects and toxicity associated with conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, remains a problem. MicroRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumour suppressors in different types of cancers. Their distinct gene expression in various stages and types of cancerous cells make them attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. The growing research and clinical interests in gene therapy and nano-drug delivery systems have led to the development of potential miRNA-targeted treatments encompassing miRNA mimics, antagonists, and their use in cancer chemotherapy sensitization. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in understanding the role of miRNAs in cancer development and their potential use as biomarkers in clinical diagnostics and as targets in chemotherapy of cancer."
