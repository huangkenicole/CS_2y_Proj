        "Between 1973 and 1987, 257 patients with ascites were seen in our divisions and 101 deaths due to cancer out of those who received multi-drug anticancer chemotherapy were surveyed: 1) They consisted of 45 ovarian cancers, 15 uterine corpus cancers, 5 uterine cervical cancers and 36 unknown primary cancers, or cancers other than gynecologic malignancies. 2) Survival time from the time of aspiration of ascites tended to be longer in four years from 1977 and 1981 than in four years from 1973. 3) The survival time was different in each patient groups having various combination chemotherapy and the longest was seen in the group of patients who received THP-ADM and CDDP-containing regimen as the next. 4) Patients survived for the longest period when a total amount of ascites less than 100 ml was aspirated and patients whose ascites was drained out more than 50,000 ml were the next longest survivors. 5) Clinical efficacy by multi-drug chemotherapy for malignant ascites was possibly predicted by our drug sensitivity assay by using primary cultured cancer cells."
