        "Prominent angiogenesis, which is a hallmark of invasive cancer is preceded at the precancerous stage by marked ischemia. Our hypothesis proposes a structural mechanism responsible for altering blood flow in the covering epithelium and leading to marked reduction of vascularization in the foci of dysplasia. This mechanism varies from one type of epithelium to another. In squamous epithelium only basal cells are in direct contact with stromal vessels. To supply nutrients to the rest of the cells located at different levels, the subjacent stroma forms excrescences which penetrate upward together with blood capillaries. As soon as precancerous dysplastic alterations start and progress the number of intraepithelial blood vessels simultaneously decreases, thus leading to ischemia which precedes or promotes malignization of the covering squamous epithelium. To compensate for the deficit in blood supply, the dysplastic cells penetrate deeper into the underlying stroma, commencing invasion. Thus, the cells destroy the subjacent stroma not because they are initially \"malignant\", but due to ischemia which provokes the search for nutrients. Comparing squamous epithelium with glandular respiratory epithelium shows that the latter contains no blood capillaries at all. However, unlike squamous epithelial coverings, in respiratory epithelial covering, each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has ample access to the blood supply. Covering respiratory epithelium itself seldom gives rise directly to malignant growth. Cancerization of this type of epithelium occurs in the foci of squamous metaplasia. The latter are not supplied by a sufficient amount of blood vessels and in the majority of cases remain fragile and vulnerable structures, easily prone to malignization. Further study of these phenomenon should include the clarification of the influence of carcinogenic agents on the mechanism of adequate vascularization at the precancerous stage."
