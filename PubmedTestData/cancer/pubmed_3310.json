        "Advances in engineered recombinant nuclease have provided facile and reliable methods for genome editing. Especially with the development of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease) system, the discovery of various versions of Cas9 proteins and delivery carriers, it is now practicable to introduce desired mutations into the genome, to correct disease-related mutations, and to activate or suppress genes of interest. Epigenetic regulators are often disturbed in cancer cells and are essential for the transformation of normal to cancerous cells. Tumor-related epigenetic alterations or epigenetic factor mutations play a major part during the various steps of carcinogenesis and affect a variety of cancer-related genes and a wide range of cancerous phenotypes. Therefore, epigenetic regulatory enzymes might be candidate targets for cancer therapy. In this review, we discuss prospects of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in targeting epigenetics for cancer gene therapy."
