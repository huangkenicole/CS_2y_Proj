        "A combination of psoralens and ultraviolet A radiation is widely used to treat psoriasis. Long-term, high-dose exposure to psoralen + ultraviolet A is associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we used p53 mutations as a molecular marker to determine the separate contributions of psoralen + ultraviolet A and other ultraviolet exposures, such as ultraviolet B for skin cancer development in psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients. The results indicated that of 69 tumors analyzed, 37 (54%) tumors had one or more p53 mutations. Of 37 tumors with mutations, 17 (46%) tumors had only ultraviolet-type mutations, two (5%) tumors had only psoralen + ultraviolet A-type mutations, and 18 (49%) tumors had both types of mutations. Interestingly, psoralen + ultraviolet A-type p53 mutations were more frequent than ultraviolet type in tumors arising in patients with high-dose exposure to psoralen + ultraviolet A. Field cancerization and tumor heterogeneity appeared to occur frequently in the same patient and even in the same tumor. This study's data suggest that psoralen + ultraviolet A-induced p53 mutations may play an important part in the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer in psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated patients, but these mutations are likely to act in concert with the effects of other carcinogenic exposures, particularly ultraviolet B, in the development of skin cancer."
