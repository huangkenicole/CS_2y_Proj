        "During the past several decades, numerous studies have provided insights into biological characteristics of cancer cells and identified various hallmarks of cancer acquired in the tumorigenic processes. However, it is still challenging to image these distinctive traits of cancer to facilitate the management of patients in clinical settings. The rapidly evolving field of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has provided opportunities to investigate cancer's biological characteristics in vivo. This article reviews the current status of PET imaging on characterizing hallmarks of cancer and discusses the future directions of PET imaging strategies facilitating in vivo cancer phenotyping."
