      "AbstractText": [
        "Telomerase activity is thought to be necessary for cellular immortality and carcinogenesis. The mRNA that encodes the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) has recently been identified, and expression of hTERT mRNA is thought to regulate activation of telomerase. To determine at what stage of carcinogenesis cells begin to express hTERT, we analysed hTERT mRNA expression in gastric carcinoma and precancerous conditions, focusing on chronic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia.",
        "Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, hTERT gene expression was investigated in 18 gastric cancers and 60 specimens of chronic gastritis. Telomerase activity was evaluated using telomeric repeat amplification protocol.",
        "Sixteen of 18 (89%) gastric carcinomas expressed hTERT mRNA, and this expression was unrelated to histological type or depth of invasion. Telomerase activity was found in seven of eight (88%) gastric cancer tissues, all of which expressed hTERT mRNA. Expression of hTERT mRNA was positive in 14 of 60 (23%) specimens of chronic gastritis, and was most prominent in seven of 15 (47%) specimens of gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. Expression of the hTERT gene was significantly more frequent in chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia than in gastritis without intestinal metaplasia (P=0.030). In addition, hTERT gene expression was not correlated with age, sex, biopsy site, histological grade of inflammatory cells, glandular atrophy and lymph follicles, or infection with Helicobacter pylori. None of eight normal gastric mucosa expressed hTERT mRNA.",
        "Our results indicate that hTERT mRNA is expressed in precancerous conditions as well as in gastric cancer, and that hTERT gene expression is induced at an early stage of gastric carcinogenesis."
