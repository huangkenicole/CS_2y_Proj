        "Rhode Island has one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the nation. In an average year, about 5000 new cancers are reported to the Rhode Island Cancer Registry, and more than 2300 Rhode Islanders succumb to the disease. In response to this problem the Rhode Island Department of Health assembled cancer experts from around the state to plan priority cancer control activities for the 1990s. Their plan for 1990-1992 is the subject of this report. Five cancers were selected as the foci of cancer control activities: cancers of the lung, colon-rectum, breast, cervix, and oral cavity. The plan proposes prevention, screening, and treatment interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from these diseases. Rhode Islanders will have to work together to achieve the 33% reduction in cancer mortality proposed as a goal for the year 2000. Surveillance suggests progress on some fronts, but marching in place on others."
