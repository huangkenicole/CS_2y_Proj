        "The increasing number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures and lower transplant-related mortality has led to a growing population of survivors facing long-term increased risk of secondary malignancy, including cutaneous neoplasms. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence, risk factors and preventive strategies for secondary skin neoplasms after autologous and allogeneic HSCT. Cutaneous neoplasms, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, are among the most common solid cancers arising in patients after HSCT. Besides risk factors established in the general population, primary disease, chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGvHD), prolonged immunosuppression, especially with the use of cyclosporine and azathioprine, radiation exposure, light skin color, male sex, and young age at transplantation play a role in the development of cutaneous neoplasms in HSCT recipients. Skin cancer development after HSCT may be explained by cumulative effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced DNA damage, prolonged immunosuppressive conditions and chronic mucosal inflammation, particularly after allogeneic HSCT. Delayed immune recovery and persistent immunodeficiency in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) may also contribute to carcinogenesis. Regular dermatological surveillance and prompt recognition of precancerous and cancerous lesions is crucial for patient's prognosis and management."
