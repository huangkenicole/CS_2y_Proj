        "Whole-genome doubling (WGD) has been observed in 30% of cancers, followed by a highly complex rearranged karyotype unfavourable to breast cancer's outcome. However, the macro-alterations that characterise liver metastasis in breast cancer(BC) are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis of liver metastases to explore the status and the time frame model of these macro-alterations in pre-treatment patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
        "Whole-genome sequencing was conducted in 11 paired primary tumours, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis fresh samples from four patients with late-stage breast cancer. We also chose five postoperative frozen specimens from patients with early-stage breast cancer before any treatment as control. Surprisingly, all four liver metastasis samples were classified as WGD\u2009+\u2009. However, the previous study reported that WGD happened in 30% of cancers and 2/5 in our early-stage samples. WGD was not observed in the two separate primary tumours and one lymph node metastasis of one patient with metastatic BC, but her liver metastasis showed an early burst of bi-allelic copy number gain. The phylogenetic tree proves her 4 tumour samples were the polyclonal origin and only one WGD\u2009+\u2009clone metastasis to the liver. Another 3 metastatic BC patients' primary tumour and lymph node metastasis experienced WGD as well as liver metastasis, and they all showed similar molecular time-frame of copy number(CN) gain across locations within the same patient. These patients' tumours were of monoclonal origin, and WGD happened in a founding clone before metastasis, explaining that all samples share the CN-gain time frame. After WGD, the genomes usually face instability to evolve other macro-alterations. For example, a greater quantity and variety of complex structural variations (SVs) were detected in WGD\u2009+\u2009samples. The breakpoints were enriched in the chr17: 39\u00a0Mb-40\u00a0Mb tile, which contained the HER2 gene, resulting in the formation of tyfonas, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, and double minutes. These complex SVs may be involved in the evolutionary mechanisms of the dramatic increase of HER2 copy number.",
        "Our work revealed that the WGD\u2009+\u2009clone might be a critical evolution step for liver metastasis and favoured following complex SV of breast cancer."
