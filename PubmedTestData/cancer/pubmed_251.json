        "Skin cancer constitutes the most frequently reported post-transplant malignancy in solid organ transplant recipients (OTR) worldwide. Whereas the risk for malignant melanoma is only moderately increased, non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) seem to thrive on chronic immunosuppression and account for up to 95% of post-transplant cutaneous malignancies. Compared to the general population cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and actinic keratoses (AK) characteristically show even higher incidences than basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and act as an indicator for the development of multiple primary cutaneous neoplasias and locally recurrent cancers (field cancerization). Early diagnosis and therapy of pre-malignant cutaneous lesions is crucial for the secondary prophylaxis of further invasive and highly aggressive skin cancers. High quality interdisciplinary care and prophylactic modalities, including consistent and sufficient UV protection, topical immunmodulatory therapies of UV-damaged skin areas, retinoid chemoprevention as well as tapering immunosuppressive treatment or the selection of immunosuppressants with proposed antiangiogenic properties like mTor-inhibitors may help to reduce the multiplicity of subsequent primary skin cancers in high-risk patients. Apart from the continuous need for educational intervention of OTR in the primary prophylaxis of post-transplant skin cancers, dermatologic care occupies a central position within the field of transplantation medicine in terms of pre- and post-transplantation dermatologic evaluation and therapy as well as the implication of timely and effective secondary preventive approaches in the management of this high-risk patient population."
