        "We review the evidence suggesting the involvement of Cadherin 13 (CDH13, T-cadherin, H-cadherin) in various cancers. CDH13 is an atypical member of the cadherin family, devoid of a transmembrane domain and anchored to the exterior surface of the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. CDH13 is thought to affect cellular behavior largely through its signaling properties. It is often down-regulated in cancerous cells. CDH13 down-regulation has been associated with poorer prognosis in various carcinomas, such as lung, ovarian, cervical and prostate cancer. CDH13 re-expression in most cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and invasiveness, increases susceptibility to apoptosis, and reduces tumor growth in in vivo models. These properties suggest that CDH13 may represent a possible target for therapy in some cancers. At the same time, CDH13 is up-regulated in blood vessels growing through tumors and promotes tumor neovascularization. In contrast to most cancer cell lines, CDH13 overexpression in endothelial cells promotes their proliferation and migration, and has a pro-survival effect. We also discuss molecular mechanisms that may regulate CDH13 expression and underlie its roles in cancer."
