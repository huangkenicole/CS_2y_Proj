        "The purpose of this systematic review was to provide physicians and patients with a synthesis of the available data and an assessment of the operating characteristics associated with baseline LDCT screening for lung cancer. Various databases, meeting abstracts, clinical trials in progress, and major textbooks for relevant data from 1966 to 2006 were searched for relevant studies. The median value of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 81%, 81%, 8% and 99%, respectively. Of the studies that compared LDCT with other lung cancer screening maneuvers, it was found that LDCT detected a greater number of cancerous nodules. On average, 80% of lung cancers detected by baseline LDCT screening were categorized as Stage I cancers. Current data demonstrate that both the operating characteristics of baseline LDCT screening and the relatively high proportion of Stage I cancers detected with LDCT may potentially lead to effective screening programs. However, evidence of reduced mortality and morbidity with the use of LDCT is not established. Therefore, LDCT for lung cancer screening should be considered as investigative and needs to be confirmed by well-designed randomized controlled trials prior to community and institutional implementation."
