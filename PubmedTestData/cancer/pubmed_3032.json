        "Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is a transcription factor that has an important role in stem cell differentiation and self-renewal. Oct4 has also been implicated in tumorigenicity of different cancers. This study aimed to analyze Oct4 expression in gastric carcinoma (GC) and to evaluate the relation between Oct4 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis in addition to patient survival.",
        "Oct4 mRNA was detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in 45 GC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. We found a significant difference in Oct4 mRNA relative expression levels in GC tissue compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to study the Oct4 expression in GC cases. High Oct4 immunostaining was detected in 62.2% of GC specimens. High Oct4 expression both by mRNA relative quantitation and IHC were significantly related to poorly differentiated tumors, nodal metastasis, and stage III tumors. Moreover, high Oct4 IHC expression was also associated with cases positive for Ki-67 and VEGF expressions (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 0.021, respectively). Oct4 expression identified by both mRNA relative quantitation and IHC was significantly related (p\u2009<\u20090.001). As regards patient survival, high Oct4 expression was significantly related to poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.029 and 0.031, respectively).",
        "Oct4 plays a valuable role in the progression and prognosis of GC. High Oct4 expression is associated with high tumor grade, nodal metastasis, stage III tumors, and poor OS and DFS. High Oct4 is also significantly associated with Ki-67 and VGEF expression, thus enhancing tumor proliferation and angiogenesis."
