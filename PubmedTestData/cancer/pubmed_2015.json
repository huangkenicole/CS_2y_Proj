        "Cancer is a fatal disease worldwide. Each year ten million people are diagnosed around the world, and more than half of patients eventually die from it in many countries. A majority of cancer remains asymptomatic in the earlier stages, with specific symptoms appearing in the advanced stages when the chances of adequate treatment are low. Cancer screening is generally executed by different imaging techniques like ultrasonography (USG), mammography, CT-scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging techniques, however, fail to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous cells for early diagnosis. To confirm the imaging result, solid and liquid biopsies are done which have certain limitations such as invasive (in case of solid biopsy) or missed early diagnosis due to extremely low concentrations of circulating tumor DNA (in case of liquid biopsy). Therefore, it is essential to detect certain biomarkers by a noninvasive approach. One approach is a proteomic or glycoproteomic study which mostly identifies proteins and glycoproteins present in tissues and serum. Some of these studies are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Another non-expensive and comparatively easier method to detect glycoprotein biomarkers is by ELISA, which uses lectins of diverse specificities. Several of the FDA approved proteins used as cancer biomarkers do not show optimal sensitivities for precise diagnosis of the diseases. In this regard, expression of phosphoproteins is associated with a more specific stage of a particular disease with high sensitivity and specificity. In this review, we discuss the expression of different serum phosphoproteins in various cancers. These phosphoproteins are detected either by phosphoprotein enrichment by immunoprecipitation using phosphospecific antibody and metal oxide affinity chromatography followed by LC-MS/MS or by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-ToF/MS analysis. The updated knowledge on phosphorylated proteins in clinical samples from various cancer patients would help to develop these serum phophoproteins as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of cancer."
