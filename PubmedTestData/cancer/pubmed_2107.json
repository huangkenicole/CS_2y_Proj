      "AbstractText": [
        "Head and neck cancer (HNSCC) is one of the most lethal cancers characterized by high relapse and poor prognosis. Several miRNAs have been implicated in HNSCC, including the tumor suppressor miR-137. A large CpG island (CpG73) spans most of the miR-137 gene sequence and stretches 659-bp downstream, ending just upstream of miR-2682 in the same host gene. Here, we assessed the role of the MIR137/MIR2682 locus in HNSCC.",
        "MiRNA expression was analyzed in paired cancerous and normal tissues from 77 HNSCC patients by Quantitative Reverse-Transcription PCR. CpG73 methylation in paired tissues from 48 patients was determined by combined bisulfite restriction analysis. Associations between expression and methylation levels and patient clinicopathological parameters were investigated.",
        "Decreased expression of miR-137 (P<0.01) and miR-2682 (P<0.01) precursors was observed in cancerous tissues, most significantly in oropharyngeal tumors. Lower miR-137 levels correlated with increased perineural invasiveness (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Predicted common miRNA targets MTDH and Notch1 were upregulated in tumor tissues. The CpG73 region between miR-137 and miR-2682 was hypermethylated in tumors. Methylation was observed in 60.4% of cancerous compared to 31.6% of normal tissues, and methylation levels were significantly higher (P<0.01) in tumors. Increased methylation correlated with decreased disease-free patient survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024).",
        "The MIR137/MIR2682 locus correlated with HNSCC perineural invasiveness. This is the first report showing miR-2682 downregulation in head and neck cancer. Our results support the tumor suppressive role of miR-137 and miR-2682. The inverse correlation between CpG73 hypermethylation and disease-free survival suggests this epigenetic mark may have prognostic value in HNSCC."
