        "Novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy selection are urgently needed to facilitate early detection and improve therapy outcomes. We have previously identified a novel phosphorylation site at serine 506 (PS506) on topoisomerase-I (topo-I) and have shown that it is widely expressed in cell lines derived from several cancers, including lung cancer, but is low in cell lines derived from non-cancerous tissues. Here we have investigated how PS506 expression in lung tissue specimens correlates with their malignant status. We find that PS506 expression is significantly elevated in malignant tumors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to adjacent, non-cancerous lung tissue and benign lung tumors. PS506 expression was up to 6-fold higher in malignant specimens than in paired non-malignant tissue. Using the well-characterized NIH/NCI 60-cell line panel, we correlate the most elevated expression levels of PS506 in lung, ovarian, and colon cancer cells lines with increased sensitivity to camptothecin, a plant alkaloid that targets topo-I. This is consistent with our earlier studies in a smaller sampling of cell lines and with our finding that PS506 increases topo-I DNA binding. Two widely used chemotherapeutic drugs for ovarian and colon cancer, topotecan and irinotecan, respectively, are derived from camptothecin. Irinotecan has also displayed efficacy in clinical trials of NSCLC. Our results suggest that elevated PS506 expression may correlate with clinical chemosensitivity to these agents in ovarian, colon, and NSCLC. PS506 may therefore serve as a biomarker for diagnosis or therapy selection."
