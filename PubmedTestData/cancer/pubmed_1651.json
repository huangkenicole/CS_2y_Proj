        "Over the past decade, several artificial intelligence (AI) systems are developed to assist in endoscopic assessment of (pre-)cancerous lesions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of the possible indications of AI technology in upper GI endoscopy and hypothesize about potential challenges for its use in clinical practice.",
        "Application of AI in upper GI endoscopy has been investigated for several indications: (1) detection, characterization, and delineation of esophageal and gastric cancer (GC) and their premalignant conditions; (2) prediction of tumor invasion; and (3) detection of Helicobacter pylori. AI systems show promising results with an accuracy of up to 99% for the detection of superficial and advanced upper GI cancers. AI outperformed trainee and experienced endoscopists for the detection of esophageal lesions and atrophic gastritis. For GC, AI outperformed mid-level and trainee endoscopists but not expert endoscopists.",
        "Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may improve early diagnosis of esophageal and gastric cancer and may enable endoscopists to better identify patients eligible for endoscopic resection. The benefit of AI on the quality of upper endoscopy still needs to be demonstrated, while prospective trials are needed to confirm accuracy and feasibility during real-time daily endoscopy."
