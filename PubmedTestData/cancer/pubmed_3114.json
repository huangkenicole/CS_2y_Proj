        "Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) are the allotropes of carbon in nanosize dimension and are popular in medicinal field. These nano-based technologies are gaining high interest in the recent years for the treatment of diseases that are previously considered to be impossible to cure. CNTs have gained significance in the treatment of the majority of disorders such as Malaria, Alzheimer's disease, Infectious disease, and Asthma. Moreover, patient's responsiveness also increased in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. To date, a number of reviews are available in the literature covering applications of CNT in cancer. However, the purpose of this review is to focus on the use of CNTs in drug delivery of non-cancerous diseases. The novelty of this review is that it is focused on the applicability of CNT in the various non-cancerous diseases. Detailed information was collected from the literature which will guide and encourage researchers to explore the applicability of CNT in various non-cancerous diseases in the future."
