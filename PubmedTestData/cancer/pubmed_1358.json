        "Recently, magnetic Hyperthermia is one of the promising methods for cancer treatments. In this method by applying magnetic fields and generating heat, cancerous tissues are eliminated. The degree and pattern of generated heat in cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues plays an important role on the outcome of the treatment. it is mainly affected by diffusion and distribution pattern of magnetic nanoparticles within the cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. Study the diffusion and distribution patterns of magnetic nanoparticle in vivo is difficult and costly in many cases and in some cases evaluating the amount of generated heat at cancer site is almost impossible. In vitro models for cancer tissues are alternatives for in vivo models. However, usual in vitro models could not resembling all the characteristics of a cancer tumor. In this hypothesis we propose that using 3D printers can provide a platform to fabricate a personalized in vitro cancer model which could simulate the most important features of the cancerous tissues (including shape and vascular network) and can be used to study magnetic hyperthermia in a simulated media of compatible to in vivo conditions."
