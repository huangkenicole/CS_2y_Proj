        "To explore the expression of B7-1 antigen (Ag), the most important costimulatory molecule for T-lymphocyte activation, on tumor cells from cancerous human tissues.",
        "The study group consisted of 82 biopsies taken from a variety of cancerous human tissues. Ten normal cervical specimens, used as controls, were taken from uteri removed for leiomyomas or leiomyomatosis. B7-1 molecule expression was identified using monoclonal antibody (Ab) with CD80 and the SABC technique.",
        "In most cases (50/82), the tumor cells were totally or partially B7-1 Ag positive. The positive products were distributed mainly on the cell surface and, in some cases, also in the cytoplasm. Although in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, all tumor cells in all three cases stained strongly with CD80, in squamous cell carcinoma and adnocarcinoma, the B7-1 expression in cancer cells was detected in 3/56 and 15/23 cases, respectively. The intensity and distribution of B7-1 expression from case to case were heterogeneous: half the cases had relatively homogeneous and stronger B7-1 expression in cancer cells. Additionally, there were B7-1+ dendritic cells and lymphocytes scattered or densely infiltrating interstitial tissue. In some cases, the endothelia of small vessels were proved to be B7-1+. There was one esophageal cancer specimen containing normal-looking mucosa in which B7-1 molecule expression was also demonstrated in the squamous and glandular epithelia.",
        "Our findings demonstrate that the tumor cells in cancerous human tissues do not all fail to express B7-1. The mechanism of the failure of hosts to reject tumors can be attributed not only to the lack of costimulatory molecules in tumor cells but also to events after the Ag-presenting process."
