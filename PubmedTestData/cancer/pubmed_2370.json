      "AbstractText": [
        "Whereas the incidence of cancers increases, overall survival of cancerous patients improves. Preventing the onset of second primary cancer is a new public health challenge and requires a special attention from organ specialists. We report a rare case of carcinoma cuniculatum in a context of metastatic prostate cancer. No case was previously described. Diagnosis delay of carcinoma cuniculatum is frequent and particularly in case of endophytic intra-osseous topography. The aim of this case report is to remind that persistent pain requires medical evaluation to rule out any possibility of second primary cancer.",
        "A 78-year-old patient followed for a metastatic prostate cancer had been describing neuralgic dental pain in the lower posterior left quadrant for several months. Healing delay of tooth #37 (second left mandibular molar) extraction socket in the painful region led to an intra-alveolar incisional biopsy, which showed a tumor widely invading the mandibular body. Radiologic, histopathologic and clinical elements finally concluded to an intra-osseous carcinoma cuniculatum. Duration of total treatment (oral biopsy to hemimandibulectomy) and follow up were about five months and one year respectively. Patient died before reconstruction.",
        "This case recalls that any persistent tooth pain affecting cancer patients requires a thorough review to exclude any secondary primary cancers or any metastasis of the oral cavity and more specifically in jawbones."
