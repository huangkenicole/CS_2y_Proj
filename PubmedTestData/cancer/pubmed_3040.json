        "Expression of cancerous isoenzymes in various malignant tumors has been extensively studied using different biochemical techniques. Cancerous alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzymes such as variant ALP and placental ALP are apparently detected in sera or tissues from patients with malignant tumors. Variant ALP is a specific tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Placental ALP is found in sera of patients with various malignant diseases. However, the positive rate of each ALP isoenzyme is low except for high positivity of placental ALP in seminoma. Novel gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP) isoenzyme is specifically found in about 60% of sera from patients with HCC, but in only 3% of patients with benign liver diseases, suggesting high specificity for HCC. Serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAT), which increases in activity in parallel with the growth of prostatic tissue, is an useful marker for prostatic cancer. Thus, several cancerous isoenzymes are available for diagnosis of various malignant tumors."
