        "In this study, a Cancer Knowledge Questionnaire (CKQ) for elementary schoolchildren was developed and the relationship of cancer knowledge to attitudinal predispositions to accept and interact with children with cancer was assessed. CKQ includes 21 yes-no items that assess general cancer knowledge and knowledge of cancer's effects on social and emotional functioning. A sample of 478 children, ages six-12, completed CKQ, and a separate sample of 41 children completed it on two occasions separated by a one-week interval. Adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability were obtained. Children's knowledge of cancer increased with age but generally was limited across all age groups. Knowledge of cancer was associated positively with previous experiences with cancer, lower fear of cancer, less worry about children with cancer, and attitudinal predispositions to accept and interact with children having cancer."
