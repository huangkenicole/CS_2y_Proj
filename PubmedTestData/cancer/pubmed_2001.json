        "lncRNAs play a crucial role in the carcinogenesis process. Thus, they have been recognized as the potential therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers of cancers. This study assessed the alteration in the expression of APOC1P1-3 lncRNA in cancerous tissues compared to their adjacent non-tumorous tissues sampled from cervical cancer patients. one hundred fifteen pairs of cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous biopsy of cervical cancer specimens were collected. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were carried out. The qRT-PCR was used to assess the changes in the expression of APOC1P1-3 lncRNA. Moreover, the biomarker function of the lncRNA and the correlations between APOC1P1-3 and clinicopathological parameters were measured. The APOC1P1-3 expression was significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens as compared to adjacent non-tumorous specimens (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001). A significant association was also observed between APOC1P1-3 expression and lymph node involvement (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.031). Additionally, APOC1P1-3 expression demonstrated a significant association with the depth of tumor invasion (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.035), and squamous type of cervical cancer (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.019). The overexpression of APOC1P1-3 was significantly observed in patients younger than 50\u2009years old as compared to another age group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.033). The results of ROC curve exhibited that APOC1P1-3 with area under the curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity of 0.96, 93.91%, and 78.26%, respectively can be considered as a potential biomarker. Regarding overexpression of APOC1P1-3 in human cervical cancer samples, this lncRNA may be considered as an oncogenic factor in cervical cancer patients. Besides, APOC1P1-3 may be a possible biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer patients."
