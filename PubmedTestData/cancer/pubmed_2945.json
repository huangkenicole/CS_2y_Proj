        "Cancer is frequently caused by microRNAs, which control post-transcriptional levels of gene expression by binding to target mRNAs. MiR-29a-3p has recently been shown to play a twofold function in the majority of malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC), according to mounting evidence. Here, we not only briefly summarize such connection between miR-29a-3p and cancers, but aslo primarily evaluate the miR-29a-3p expression pattern, clinical applicability, and molecular mechanisms in CRC to provide a guide for future studies. This review established the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-29a-3p abnormalty in a variety of clinical samples for CRC. Furthermore, current molecular mechanisms of miR-29a-3p for regulating cancerous biological processes such growth, invasion, metastasis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation process, and immunomodulation through its upstream regulatory factors and downstream targeted genes were briefly explored. More specifically, miR-29a-3p has been linked to a few medications that have been shown to have anticancer benefits. To sum up, miR-29a-3p is a promising biomarker and prospective therapeutic target for the diagnosis and prognosis of CRC, but further research is still needed to establish a theoretical basis for more practical applications."
