      "AbstractText": [
        "A new murine monoclonal antibody (1H1) was prepared by immunizing mice i.p. with human pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC-3). The antibody reacted with 8 of 48 cultured cell lines that were all adenocarcinoma. Thin sections of normal and cancerous tissues were examined by immunoperoxidase staining. Thirty-nine of 48 (81%) pancreatic cancers, 11 of 23 (48%) gastric cancers, 12 of 18 (67%) colorectal cancers, 9 of 19 (48%) breast cancers, 2 of 5 (40%) lung cancers and 2 of 2 (100%) duodenal cancers were stained positively, but 5 islet cell tumors, 3 esophageal cancers and 2 hepatomas were not stained positively. Normal gastro-intestinal tract of adult or fetus was stained weakly or hardly stained. SDS-PAGE showed that 1H1 antigen recognized by 1H1 Mab had a relative molecular weight of over 400 K. Da. Immunoelectron microscopical study has shown that the antigen recognized by 1H1 antibody was localized in the cell membranes of the BxPC-3 cells. 1H1 antigen was found to be present in culture-spent medium of BxPC-3 cells by ELISA. Thus, 1H1 antibody may be useful for early detection of pancreatic cancers."
