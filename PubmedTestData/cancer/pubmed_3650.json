        "Development of tumor microenvironment (TME) modifying nanomedicine with cooperative effect between multiple stimuli responsive therapeutic modalities is necessary to achieve lower dosage induced tumor specific therapy. Accordingly, herein, a multifunctional MnOx NSs@BSA-IR780-GOx nanocomposite (MBIG NCs) is developed to modulate the oxidative stress in TME, and thus attain higher therapeutic efficacy. In the presence of glucose, the as-synthesized MBIG NCs are served as a chemodynamic agents and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by self-activation through a cascade of reactions from glucose oxidase (GOx) and manganese oxide nanosheets (MnOx NSs). Also, the MBIG NCs demonstrated excellent photodynamic properties upon irradiation with 808\u00a0nm laser owing to the presence of IR780. The combination of glucose-mediated chemodynamic and light-mediated photodynamic properties generated higher ROS than that obtained with individual stimuli. Further, the MBIG NCs exhibited photothermal effect with conversion efficiency of 33.8 %, which helped to enhance the enzymatic activities. In in vitro studies, the MBIG NCs exhibited good biocompatibility to cancerous and non-cancerous cells under non-stimulus conditions. Nevertheless, in the presence of glucose and light stimuli, they triggered more than 90 % cell toxicity at 200\u00a0ppm concentration via the cooperative effect between starvation therapy, chemodynamic therapy, and phototherapy. Furthermore, the MBIG NCs demonstrated magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging properties. These results are suggesting that MBIG NCs would be potential theranostic agents to for cancer diagnosis and target specific therapy. More importantly, the fabrication process is paving a way to improve the aqueous dispersibility, stability, and bio-applicability of MnOx NSs and IR780."
