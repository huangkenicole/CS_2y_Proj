        "Cancer is the leading cause of human deaths in the world and produces serious economic burdens. On September 12, 2018, the academic journal A Cancer Journal for Clinicians published an article about the latest statistics of cancers worldwide, which provided a status report on the global burden of 36 cancers in 185 countries worldwide. Cancer has also become a serious public health problem in China and caused more and more attention of the government and people in recent years. This review analyzes the incidence, mortality and prevalent trend of cancers in China, discusses the reasons behind this status, and reviews the potential countermeasures for cancer prevention and control in China."
