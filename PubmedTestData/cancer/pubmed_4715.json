        "The concept that dietary changes could improve the response to cancer therapy is extremely attractive to many patients, who are highly motivated to take control of at least some aspect of their treatment. Growing insight into cancer metabolism is highlighting the importance of nutrient supply to tumor development and therapeutic response. Cancers show diverse metabolic requirements, influenced by factors such as tissue of origin, microenvironment, and genetics. Dietary modulation will therefore need to be matched to the specific characteristics of both cancers and treatment, a precision approach requiring a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that determine the metabolic vulnerabilities of each cancer."
