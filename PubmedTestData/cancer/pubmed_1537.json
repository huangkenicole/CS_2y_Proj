        "It is known that variations in the concentrations of certain elements in humans may be an indication of cancers. In this work, a method for the quantitative analysis of 22 elements in non-tumor and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues from the same individual is reported. Based on the optimized platform combined with multivariate analysis, diagnostic models of ESCC were established using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), showing excellent classification of cancerous and non-cancerous group by metallomic profiling. Elemental concentrations of 10 elements (Mn, Se, Cu, Ti, Mg, Fe, Co, Zn, Sr, Ca) showed significant difference (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) in tumor and non-tumor tissues, in which Mn, Se, Cu and Ti are the top 4 elements of statistical significance and a shift towards higher concentration levels has also been observed in the tumor samples. These results confirm the considerable potential of elemental studies for biomedical purposes. To our knowledge, previous studies on elemental concentration in esophageal cancer were performed in serum or plasma levels; and this is the first study to evaluate the association of tissue elemental concentrations with ESCC."
