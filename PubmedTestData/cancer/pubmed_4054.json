        "A method combining the urine cancer reaction, purple reaction and heat tolerance test (combined method of urine-purple-heat tolerance) was used to examine 112 normal persons, 110 non-cancer patients and 93 cancer patients. It was found that the accuracy rate of the urine reaction was 82%, of the purple reaction 77.4%, and of the heat tolerance 79%. The combined method showed great diagnostic value for cancers in the digestive tract, such as stomach, biliary duct, colon, pancreas and liver, as well as other cancers, e.g., lung cancer, lymphosarcoma and brain tumor. This method may be best for screening the above tumors. Its positive rate was also high in malignant reticuloma, chronic granulocytic leukemia and reticulosarcoma. The mechanism of the combined method and the influential factors, such as the freshness of the specimen, reactive time, temperature and quality of the reagents are discussed."
