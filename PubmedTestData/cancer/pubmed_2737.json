        "Numerous studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have many biological functions and play crucial roles in various human cancers, including cancer development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer patients. CCAT2, a novel long non-coding RNA, has been identified as correlating with several different types of cancers. However, the role of lncRNA CCAT2 in gastric cancer (GC) patients is unknown. The purpose of our research was to investigate the function and prognostic significance of lncRNA CCAT2 expression in GC patients.",
        "Expression of lncRNA CCAT2 was examined in 208 paired normal and cancerous gastric tissues. Molecular and cellular techniques were used to explore the biological function of lncRNA CCAT2 in GC cells. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the prognostic significance of lncRNA CCAT2 expression.",
        "The results showed that lncRNA CCAT2 was upregulated in GC tissues (P=0.000), and positively correlated with TNM stage (P=0.029), lymphatic invasion (P=0.042) and nervous invasion (P=0.024) in GC patients. Furthermore, we also found that high expression of lncRNA CCAT2 was an unfavorable prognostic factor in GC patients. Silencing of lncRNA CCAT2 inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion.",
