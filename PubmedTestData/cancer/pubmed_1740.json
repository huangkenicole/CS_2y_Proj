        "Bladder cancer is often characterized by recurrent and multifocal growth, and tumours are frequently accompanied by precancerous alterations of the surrounding urothelium. These findings have led to the hypothesis that cells from areas of genetically aberrant but morphologically non-cancerous or even unremarkable mucosa may be the source of bladder carcinomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using ten probes targeting five different chromosomes that are known to be frequently altered in bladder cancer (centromere 1, 8, 9, 11, 17 and 1p36, 8p23, 9p21, 11q13, 17p13) on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 11 superficial bladder cancers. Copy number changes of the tumours were compared to those in the urothelium adjacent to the tumour. Eleven of 11 (100%) tumours and eight of 11 (73%) samples of adjacent urothelium showed copy number changes of at least one chromosome. The occurrence of similar patterns of chromosomal aberrations in the tumours and their associated urothelium supports the hypothesis of a clonal relationship. It is concluded that FISH analysis targeting five different chromosomes is more sensitive than conventional histology for distinguishing between neoplastic and normal cells of the urothelium."
