        "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the nature of the control mechanism of human carcinogenesis by applying regression analysis technique to the world statistics of various human neoplasias. The information used in the present study covers 19 cancers in the tumor spectrum, 47 cancer registration areas in space, and the years 1978 to 1982 in time. The risk for each cancer was expressed in terms of the annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR). Results obtained are as follows: 1) The regression analysis of the world statistics demonstrated the existence of 3 subfamilies of cancer: a) Western type subfamily including 13 cancers; b) non-Western type subfamily including 4 cancers; c) independent type subfamily including 2 cancers. 2) Further regression analysis of the world statistics data revealed the presence of a mathematical regularity that characterized the relationship between various cancers and their risk changes in 47 areas of the world. The mathematical regularity of the above intercancer linkage closely resembled that of intersteroidal linkage of urine that was derived from the law of mass action. On the basis of the calculation results with the intercancer linkage, the international risk differences of various cancers are explained by use of the equilibrium model that resembles that of the chemical equilibrium model. Evidence is also presented to suggest that the intercancer equilibrium is maintained through the interaction between a proto-oncogen and a tumor suppressor gene in carcinogenesis. The significance of the environment-dependent control mechanism of human carcinogenesis is discussed in the light of population ecology."
