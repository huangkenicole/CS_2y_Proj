        "Relationships among tenascin expression, DNA ploidy, and P-glycoprotein were examined in 81 primary human colon cancers and 61 metastatic lymph nodes. First, the DNA ploidy patterns of colon cancerous tissue surrounded (TN+) and not surrounded (TN-) by tenascin immunoreactivity were investigated. Then the expression of P-glycoprotein, one of two multidrug resistance gene products, was examined in TN+ and TN- colon cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. Aneuploid DNA patterns were observed at high frequency in TN- colon cancer tissues (37/61) and metastatic lymph nodes (44/52). In contrast, diploid DNA patterns were observed predominantly in TN+ colon cancer tissues (50/56). Although P-glycoprotein expression was observed in primary TN+ and TN- colon cancer (9/81), the level of P-glycoprotein expression was not correlated with DNA aneuploidy in TN- colon cancer tissues. Overall, reduced tenascin expression was correlated well with DNA aneuploidy, but no significant correlation was found between DNA aneuploidy and P-glycoprotein appearing when cancer cells become resistant to several anti-cancer drugs. Thus, tenascin may play an important role in preventing colon cancer cells from invading surrounding tissues."
