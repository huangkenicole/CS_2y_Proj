        "Chimeric RNAs have been believed to be solely produced by gene fusions resulting from chromosomal rearrangement, thus unique features of cancer. Detected chimeric RNAs have also been viewed as surrogates for the presence of gene fusions. However, more and more research has demonstrated that chimeric RNAs in general are not a hallmark of cancer, but rather widely present in non-cancerous cells and tissues. At the same time, they may be produced by other mechanisms other than chromosomal rearrangement. The field of non-canonical chimeric RNAs is still in its infancy, with many challenges ahead, including the lack of a unified terminology. However, we believe that these non-canonical chimeric RNAs will have significant impacts in cancer detection and treatment."
