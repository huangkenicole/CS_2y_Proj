        "Epithelial ovarian cancer is responsible for almost half of all the deaths from female genital tract tumors. Major impediments to the clinical treatment of this disease are the relatively asymptomatic progression and a lack of knowledge regarding defined precursor or malignant lesions. Most epithelial ovarian cancers are thought to arise from the transformation of ovarian surface epithelial cells, a single continuous layer of flat-to-cuboidal mesothelial cells surrounding the ovary. To improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer, it is necessary to study the biological characteristics of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. However, this approach has been hampered by the inability to purify and culture such human cells. During the past decade, procedures to isolate and culture human ovarian surface epithelial cells have been developed, and, subsequently, using viral oncogenes, several immortalized cells have been established. This new experimental system is being employed to improve our understanding of the genetic changes leading to the initiation of epithelial ovarian cancer and to identify events in the cancer's development. This review mainly describes the biological dynamics of ovarian surface epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer, focusing on humans and excluding small animal models."
