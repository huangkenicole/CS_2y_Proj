        "To evaluate the predictive value of preoperative peripheral inflammatory markers in patients with vocal fold leukoplakia.",
        "A retrospective study was performed of the patients diagnosed with vocal fold leukoplakia and who accepted carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser resection in our center in the last 10\u00a0years. We calculated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) after collecting and analyzing the clinical, histopathological and laboratory data. The potential relation between blood indexes and clinical events as recurrence or canceration was evaluated.",
        "A total of 589 patients were involved, including 300 cases without recurrence (group A), 198 with recurrence but not canceration (group B) and 91 transformed into squamous cancer (group C). Baseline analysis of NLR, PLR, and MLR showed no difference among the three groups before the first surgery. But all the indexes significantly elevated in groups B (P\u2009<\u20090.001,\u2009<\u20090.001, 0.023, respectively) and C (P\u2009=\u20090.009, 0.004, 0.007, respectively) in the last operation. The receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis showed NLR as a potential marker of canceration of leukoplakia (AUC\u2009=\u20090.837) and the cutoff value was 2.505. When regrouping with pathological outcomes, severe dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) groups both revealed a higher level of NLR, PLR, and MLR comparing to the no dysplasia, mild dysplasia, and moderate dysplasia groups. NLR, PLR, and MLR in high-risk group (moderate, severe dysplasia and carcinoma) also elevated comparing to low-risk group (no dysplasia, mild dysplasia) (P\u2009=\u20090.039, 0.011, 0.007, respectively).",
        "The peripheral inflammatory markers NLR, PLR, and MLR are closely connected with the development of vocal fold leukoplakia. NLR may be a potential marker to predict the poor outcomes (recurrence or canceration) of patients in first surgery."
