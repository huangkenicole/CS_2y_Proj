        "Considering the affecting role of environmental factors including trace elements and heavy metals on the upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, there is paucity of empirical research in tissue evaluations.",
        "The present study aimed to measure the tissue content of some trace elements and heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), tin (Sn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), lead (Pb), and iron (Fe) in esophagus and gastric cancerous tissues compared to the adjacent healthy tissues.",
        "In a cross-sectional study, the aforementioned trace elements and heavy metals were evaluated among patients with esophagus and gastric cancers. During endoscopy, multiple samples were taken from cancerous lesions and the adjacent healthy tissues. The classic flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) method was employed as the study framework.",
        "Fifty patients with the mean age of 53.92 \u00b1 8.73 were enrolled in the current study. Thirteen patients suffered from esophageal cancer and thirty-seven patients were afflicted with gastric cancer. The results revealed significant differences in the median concentrations of Zn, Cr, Sn and, Cu (P < 0.05) between the two groups. Although there were no significant changes in the tissue content in the esophageal samples, in the median concentrations of Zn, Cr and, Sn (P < 0.05) in gastric tissues, significant differences were observed. Further, the results indicated that gender enacted an affecting role in the level of some trace elements and heavy metals.",
        "The tissue contents of some elements were altered in gastric and esophageal cancers; this difference may reflect the underlying mechanism of cellular changing during the tumorigenesis or direct exposure of these elements. It seems that under the shade of other coexisting risk factors, larger cohort studies are suggested to be conducted to investigate other probable aspects in this area of interest."
