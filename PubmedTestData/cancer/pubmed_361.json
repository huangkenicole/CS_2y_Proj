        "The development of second primary tumors (SPTs) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has become an increasingly important factor in clinical treatment decisions. Currently, clinical and histologic parameters are used to determine whether or not SPT is present. Recent studies suggest that many SPTs in the upper aerodigestive tract have a common clonal origin, challenging the longstanding multiclonal origin concept. To determine genetic relationships among multiple oral cancerous and precancerous lesions (MOCP), we analysed 100 lesions from 26 Japanese patients. Lesion development was synchronous and metachronous. We looked for patterns of microsatellite alterations (MA) using seven markers at chromosomes 3p14, 9p21, and 17p13, where MA occurs early in oral carcinogenesis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 52.6% (41/78), 62.5% (60/96), and 59.3% (32/54) of informative MOCP at 3p14, 9p21, and 17p13, respectively. Microsatellite instability (MI) was observed in 11, 26 and 13% of the samples at 3p14, 9p21, and 17p13 markers, respectively. Patterns of MA were concordant in only nine (14%) of 63 lesions from four (18%) of 22 patients who initially presented with noninvasive lesions. However, two of four patients with invasive cancer as indexed lesion showed 16 (43%) clonally related MOCP among 37 lesions (P=0.003). The results suggest that the majority of MOCP arise from clonally independent cells affected by field cancerization. However, the probability of mucosal spread of clonal malignant or premalignant cells may increase along with malignant progression."
