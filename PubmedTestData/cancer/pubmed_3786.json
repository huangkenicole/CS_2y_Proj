      "AbstractText": [
        "The high expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop2) was strongly associated with the progression of solid tumors, including pancreatic and gastric cancers. Our study aimed to construct Trop2-specific immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) probes and assess the diagnostic abilities in preclinical pancreatic and gastric cancer models.",
        "The expression of Trop2 in pancreatic cancer was determined by single-cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray (TMA). Flow cytometry was used to screen the expression of Trop2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Two nanobodies (i.e., RTD98 and RTD01) targeting Trop2 were developed and labeled with gallium-68 (<sup>68</sup>Ga, T<sub>1/2</sub>\u2009=\u20091.1 h) to construct immunoPET imaging probes. The agents were researched in cell-derived pancreatic and patient-derived gastric cancer models expressing varying Trop2.",
        "Single-cell sequencing results showed high expression of Trop2 in pancreatic ductal cells as well as acinar cells and immunohistochemical staining of TMA from pancreatic cancers showed significantly higher expression of Trop2 in cancerous than in paracancerous tissues. ImmunoPET utilizing [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-RTD98 could clearly delineate subcutaneous tumors, both in cell-derived pancreatic cancer models and patient-derived gastric cancer models, superior to imaging using [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG or a non-specific probe [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-RTD161. Another probe with improved pharmacokinetics targeting Trop2, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-RTD01, was further prepared and showed advantageous diagnostic capabilities in preclinical pancreatic cancer models.",
        "In the work, we reported two nanobody tracers targeting human Trop2 which may facilitate better use of Trop2-targeted therapeutics by noninvasively displaying expression dynamics of the target."
