        "Phosphorylation of proteins is one of the most extensively investigated post-translational protein modifications. Threonine, serine and tyrosine in proteins are the most commonly phosphorylated amino acids. Dysregulated cancer-related signaling pathways due to aberrant phosphorylation status of the key protein(s) in these pathways exist in most malignancies. Intensive studies in the recent decade have implicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the precise regulation of protein phosphorylation in cancers. In this review, we systematically delve into recent advance that underlines the multidimensional role of lncRNAs in modulating protein phosphorylation, regulating cancerous signaling and impacting prognosis of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. LncRNAs regulate protein phosphorylation via directly binding to the target protein(s), interacting with the partner protein(s) of the target protein(s) or lncRNAs-encoded small peptides. Although there are still extensive studies on disclosing the intricate interactions between lncRNAs and proteins and their impacts on protein phosphorylation, we believe that targeting lncRNAs controlling phosphorylation of key protein(s) in cancerous signaling pathways might provide novel paths for precision therapeutics of GI cancers in the future."
