        "Prostate cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in men and is a major cause of mortality in developed countries. Detection of prostate carcinoma at an early stage is crucial for successful treatment.",
        "A method for the analysis of transrectal ultrasound images aimed at computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer is tested in this paper. First, two classifiers based on k-nearest neighbors and Hidden Markov models are compared. Second, the diagnostic capacity of our system is tested by means of a set of experiments where humans with varying degrees of experience classified a set of ultrasound images with and without the aid of the computer-aided system. The corpus used in this study was specifically acquired for this purpose. It consists of 4944 ultrasound images corresponding to 303 patients, and is publicly available for non-commercial use upon request.",
        "The best classification results achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 61.6%. However, the diagnostic capacity of an expert urologist using the computer-aided system improves only slightly compared with his/her capacity without the aid of the system.",
        "Despite the difficulty of this task, the obtained results indicate that discrimination between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue is possible to a certain degree. The computer-aided system helps an inexperienced user to make a better diagnosis, however it must be able to perform better in order to be useful in a real-world clinical context."
