        "Toxic metals and trace elements (TMTE) are linked to the development of several human cancers. Many reports have documented the association between some TMTE and renal cell carcinoma. In this work, we assessed the presence (qualitative) and evaluated the concentration (quantitative) of 22 TMTE in three groups of kidney tissue samples: renal cell carcinoma (RCC), adjacent non-cancerous, and control kidney tissues from cadavers. A total of 75 paired specimens of RCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were harvested immediately after radical nephrectomy and preserved in 10% diluted formalin solution. Twelve specimens, age- and sex-matched from the normal kidney tissue of the cadavers, who died from non-cancerous reasons, were collected and served as control. All tissue specimens were subjected to evaluation of TMTE concentration (22 elements in each specimen) by using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) technique. The tumor, histopathology, stage, and grade were correlated with the concentration and types of TMTE. The results showed that the histological types of RCC were as follows: clear cell type in 35 (21.5%), chromophobe 22 (13.5%), papillary 7 (4.5%), oncocytoma 5 (3.1%), and unclassified 6 (3.7%). ICP-OES revealed that tumorous (RCC) tissues had a higher concentration of 9 TMTE (Ca, Cd, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, S, and Sr) compared with both the adjacent non-cancerous and control tissue. The adjacent non-cancerous kidney tissues showed the highest concentration of Fe, K, and Na. The control of kidney tissues from cadavers had the highest level of Cu, Zn, Mo, and B compared with the cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Female patients had higher concentrations of Zn and Cu in the non-cancerous tissues of their kidneys. Younger patients had a higher concentration of B in the adjacent non-cancerous, and higher Cu in the cancerous tissues. Cadmium concentration was highest in the chromophobe cell type of RCC compared with other subtypes. There was no correlation between the TMTE concentration and the pathological stage of RCC."
