        "Invasive cancers that arise from ductal structures can infiltrate and colonize pre-existing ducts in a process referred to as cancerization of ducts (COD). COD in cholangiocarcinoma is an under-studied process whose clinical significance remains poorly understood. Even though both cancerized ducts and biliary intraepithelial neoplasias (BilINs) show dysplastic changes, hallmarks of COD are (i) an abrupt transition from the normal/reactive epithelium to severe dysplasia and (ii) close proximity to invasive carcinoma with similar cytologic features. We investigated 113 cases of surgically resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma and identified COD in 37 cases (33%). Using immunohistochemistry, we found that COD and adjacent invasive carcinoma had a concordant pattern of p53 and SMAD4 staining in 95% (21/22) and 100% (21/21) of cases, respectively. In contrast, BilINs and cancerized ducts showed significantly lower levels of concordance in p53 and SMAD4 staining at 44% (8/18) and 47% (8/17) of cases, respectively (P = 0.0007 and 0.0001, respectively). By univariate analysis, positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.027), positive final bile duct margin (P = 0.021), and the presence of COD (P = 0.020) were associated with decreased overall survival. We further performed multivariate analysis to demonstrate that positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.031), positive final bile duct margin (P = 0.035), and COD (P = 0.0051) were correlated with decreased overall survival. Together, our study highlights that COD is a clinically significant process in hilar cholangiocarcinoma that can be identified using morphological criteria in conjunction with p53 and SMAD4 immunolabeling."
