        "The sequencing panel composed of 61 target genes was used to explore the related mutation genes of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) cancerization, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis of oral submucous fibrosis cancerization, find the most important mutations in OSF cancerization, and more targeted prevention of OSF cancerization.",
        "A total of 74 clinically diagnosed samples were included, including 36 cases of OSCC and 38 cases of OSF cancer patients. DNA was extracted, and targeted gene panel sequencing technology was used to analyze the gene frequency of pathogenic mutation sites in clinical samples.",
        "Gene panel sequencing analysis showed that there were 69 mutations in 18 genes in OSCC and OSF cancerous specimens. The results of gene panel sequencing were screened, and 18 mutant genes were finally screened out and their mutation frequencies in the samples were analyzed. According to the frequency of gene mutations from high to low, they were TP53, FLT4, PIK3CA, CDKN2A, FGFR4, HRAS, BRCA1, PTPN11, NF1, KMT2A, RB1, PTEN, MSH2, MLH1, KMT2D, FLCN, BRCA2, APC. The mutation frequency of FLT4 gene was significantly higher than that of OSCC group (<i>P</i> < 0.05).",
        "FLT4 gene may be related to OSF cancerization and is expected to be an early diagnostic biomarker for OSF cancerization."
