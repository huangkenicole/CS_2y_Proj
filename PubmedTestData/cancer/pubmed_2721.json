        "Being the second leading cause of death globally, cancer has been a long-standing and rapidly evolving focus of biomedical research and practice in the world. A tremendous effort has been made to understand the origin of cancer cells, the formation of cancerous tissues, and the mechanism by which they spread and relapse, but the disease still remains mysterious. Here, we made an attempt to scrutinize evidences that indicate the role of stem cells in tumorigenesis and metastasis, and cancer relapse. We also looked into the influence of cancers on stem cells, which in turn represent a major constituent of tumor microenvironment. Based on current understandings of the properties of (cancer) stem cells and their relation to cancers, we can foresee that novel therapeutic approaches would become the next wave of cancer treatment."
