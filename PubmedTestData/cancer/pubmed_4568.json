        "Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as promising non-invasive biomarkers for human cancer. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide, but its overall survival has remained unchanged in the past 3 decades. Biomarkers for evaluating efficacy of cancer therapy are urgently needed. To explore circulating miRNAs as cancer therapy biomarkers, we initially identified that 8 miRNAs were distinctly dysregulated in cancerous tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous counterparts from 16 patients, using microarray and real-time PCR. Based on this discovery, the comparison study was performed between pre- and 6 months post-operative paired plasma samples on 9 patients. MiR-99a, which was down-regulated in cancerous tissues, was significantly increased in plasma after operation. Meanwhile, oncomiR miR-21 and miR-223 that were up-regulated in cancerous tissues, were significantly reduced in post-operative plasma samples. We firstly report the significant changes of miR-99a in plasma of HNSCC patients after surgery. Furthermore, plasma miR-223 was inversely increased in a patient whose cancer relapsed within 6 months after operation. We conclude that these circulating miRNAs may serve as biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of therapy and the prognosis of HNSCC."
