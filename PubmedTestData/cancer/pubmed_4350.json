        "CD147/Basigin/EMMPRIN (Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase inducer) is a single pass type1 transmembrane protein playing a central role in developmental process, wound healing, nutrient transport, inflammation, arthritis and also in microbial pathologies. It is also found to be a potent stimulator of MMP (matrix metalloproteinases) and has been considered as a prognostic marker in cancer. Dysregulation of CD147 is reported in several types of cancer. It activates cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis and inhibits tumor cell apoptosis under hypoxic condition. Thus, CD147 serves as a hub protein in cancer, as it is involved in several homophilic and heterophilic cellular interactions spanning the major hallmarks of cancer. Targeting these interactions is considered to be an efficient therapeutic modality in cancerous conditions. Hence, by this review we intend to collate the structure-function relationships of CD147, with an exclusive thrust on potential druggable hotspots based on its intra and inter molecular interactions."
