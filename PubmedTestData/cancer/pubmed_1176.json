        "To study the age, clinical, enteroscopic and pathological characteristics of colorectal polyps and factors affected polyp-carcinoma.",
        "We analyzed the clinical, enteroscopic and pathological characteristics of 7276 cases of colorectal polyps.",
        "The incidence of colorectal polyps was 10.94%, including 521 men and 275 women. The rate of colorectal polyp was 82.29% in 30-69 year olds. The adenomatous, inflammatory, hyperplastic and juvenile polyps were 43.84%, 42.09%, 11.06% and 1.51%, respectively. Polypoid lesions were located at cecum 3.29%, ascending 11.88%, transverse 4.89%, descending 11.58%, sigmoid 26.05%, and rectum 42.32%. Thirty-five cases (4.4%) were found to have polpous canceration. The canceration rates in villous, mixed and tubular adenomas were 29.73%, 11.11%, and 4.86%. The rate of canceration seemed to depend on its dimensions, being 1.3%, 7.4%, and 25.6% for the 0.6 - 1.0 cm, 1.1 - 1.9 cm, and > or = 2.0 cm in size, respectively. Conclusion The ages between 30-69 tend to suffer from colorectal polyps. The incidence in the male is higher than that in the female. Colorectal polyps are more likely to locate in left colon. The common pathological types were adenomatous and inflammatory polyps. There is a high canceration of polyps in the left colon, villous adenomas and > or = 2.0 cm polyps. The broader the pedicles and the larger the diameters of polyps are, the higher the canceration rate. All of the colon polyps should be excised and undergo the pathological examination. Enteroscopic polypectomy helps prevent colorectal polpous canceration."
