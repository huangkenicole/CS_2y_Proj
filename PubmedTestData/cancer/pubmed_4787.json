        "Since its development and introduction to clinical practice, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has progressed rapidly from being a purely imaging modality with limited use in the detection of small pancreatic cancers to one that can provide a tissue diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and deliver therapy. EUS has now firmly established a place as the investigation of choice in the diagnosis, locoregional staging and management of a wide range of gastrointestinal cancers. With the increasing use of FNA, the accuracy of EUS has substantially improved and may become a stand-alone investigation in some situations. However, it is recommended that a combination of information obtained from other imaging modalities and EUS is needed to maximize the accuracy, in particular to complete staging beyond locoregional stage. In addition to well-established indications, newer applications of EUS are emerging and are no longer limited to the gastrointestinal system. In lung cancer, EUS combined with endobronchial ultrasonography is emerging as an accurate, minimally invasive, nonsurgical alternative to staging of the mediastinum. Furthermore, the ability of EUS to acquire tissue safely and conveniently results in a potential role of the molecular diagnostics to enhance the performance of EUS-guided FNA. Besides a diagnostic role of EUS, there continues to be technological advances in the field of interventional EUS, with many potential applications under investigation. This review focuses on the current and future roles of EUS in the diagnosis and management of cancers."
