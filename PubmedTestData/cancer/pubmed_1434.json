        "Bladder cancer (BC) is considered as one of the most common malignant tumors in humans with complex pathogenesis including gene expression variation, protein degradation, and changes in signaling pathways. Many studies on involved miRNAs in BC have demonstrated that they could be used as potential biomarkers in the prognosis, response to treatment, and screening before the cancerous phenotype onset. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular processes through their different effects on special targets along with modifying signaling pathways, apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation. The diverse expression of miRNAs in cancerous tissues could mediate procedures leading to the oncogenic or suppressor behavior of certain genes in cancer cells. Since a specific miRNA may have multiple targets, an mRNA could also be regulated by multiple miRNAs which further demonstrates the actual role of miRNAs in cancer. In addition, miRNAs can be utilized as biomarkers in some cancers that cannot be screened in the early stages. Hence, finding blood, urine, or tissue miRNA biomarkers by novel or routine gene expression method could be an essential step in the prognosis and control of cancer. In the present review, we have thoroughly evaluated the recent findings on different miRNAs in BC which can provide comprehensive information on better understanding the role of diverse miRNAs and better decision making regarding the new approaches in the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of BC."
