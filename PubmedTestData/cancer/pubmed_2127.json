        "Ferroptosis is a new iron and reactive oxygen species dependent programmed cell death process which is different from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. It is closely related to a number of disease progression including cancers, neurodegenerative disease, cerebral hemorrhage, liver disease, and renal failure. The development of different ferroptotic inducers has been proved as an efficient therapeutic strategy for a variety of chemoradiotherapy-resistant cancer cells and cancer stem cells. In addition, the development of ferroptotic inhibitors is also becoming an emerging research hotspot for the treatment of many non-cancerous diseases. Furthermore, the combination of nanotechnology with ferroptotic therapies has exhibited additional advantages such as enhanced targeting and/or stimuli-responsive ability to tumor microenvironment, ameliorated drug solubility, ease of preparation and the integration of multifunctional theranostic platforms to develop synergetic combined therapies of great clinical importance. This paper reviews the latest advances of using tailored ferroptotic nanoparticles and ferroptotic molecular probes to be relevant for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of different diseases. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of this burgeoning field were spotlighted to promote the rational design of nano-ferroptotic drugs or theranostic probes in the near future."
