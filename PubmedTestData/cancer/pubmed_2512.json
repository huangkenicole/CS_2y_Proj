        "Pelvic radiotherapy is a powerful treatment for a broad range of cancers, including gynecological, prostate, rectal, and anal cancers. Despite improvements in the delivery of ionizing beams, damage to non-cancerous tissue can cause long-term effects that are potentially severe, affecting quality of life and daily function. There is an urgent need for new strategies to treat and reverse the side effects of pelvic radiotherapy without compromising the antitumor effect. A woman with severe radiation-induced intestinal side effects was treated with the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor infliximab with a dose of 3\u2009mg/kg every 4 to 6 weeks. With infliximab treatment, a remarkable improvement in her bowel health was observed. The patient's late bowel toxicity was reduced from Grade 2 to Grade 0 (RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scale). Although it is necessary to proceed cautiously because of the risk of serious side effects from immunosuppressants, our case suggests that infliximab can be used to treat symptoms of chronic bowel dysfunction after radiotherapy."
