        "Over the past few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the lethality of cancers depends on more than the malignant cells themselves. The environment those malignant cells are exposed to is just as important a determinant of their behavior. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is both common and deadly. It is the 6th most frequently occurring cancers, and prognosis is still generally poor. Recent evidence indicates that activated fibroblasts residing within the tumor stroma play a significant role in promoting the aggressive spread often seen in head and neck cancer. Tumor associated fibroblasts (TAFs) have also been implicated in facilitating angiogenesis and suppressing the normal anti-tumor function of immune cells. Studying the signaling molecules involved in these processes will facilitate the development of promising targets and inhibitors to prevent tumor-associated fibroblasts from exerting their reinforcing effects on the tumor. In this article, we review the recent literature on the signals used in tumor associated fibroblast communication, with a focus on potential therapeutic targets. Further, we highlight the lead candidates for TAF-targeted therapeutic interventions. Future anti-cancer strategies may achieve better results than current approaches by targeting the support cells in tumor stroma in addition to the cancerous cells."
