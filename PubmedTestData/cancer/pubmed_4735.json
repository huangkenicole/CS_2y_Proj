        "Cancer is the second leading cause of death among adults in the United States. Trends indicate that the incidence of all cancers has increased since 1973. It is currently estimated that 1 in 3 Americans now living will develop the disease. Cancer accounts for 11% of all health care costs, and its devastating physical and emotional consequences are far reaching. Despite these grim statistics, there is hope for decreasing this huge burden. Nearly two thirds of all cancers are related to life style choices, such as tobacco use, dietary factors, and exercise; therefore, the opportunity exists to reduce cancer risk greatly. The article presents an overview of major cancers and strategies for primary prevention of those cancers that are most amenable to risk reduction."
