        "PIAS3 is the endogenous inhibitor of STAT3, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancers. However, the effect of PIAS3 on human tumors remains elusive. The aim of this article is to investigate the expression of PIAS3 in gastric carcinoma and its adjacent non-tumor tissues.",
        "Samples were taken from 30 patients with gastric cancer, which included tumor or non-tumor tissues in the excised sections. The expression of PIAS3 protein was detected by immunocytochemistry, and that of mRNA by in situ hybridization. The results were semi-quantitative analyzed by using cell count and color depth to stage.",
        "The expression levels of PIAS3 protein and mRNA were significantly lower in gastric cancerous tissues than in its adjacent non-tumor tissues, and had a close relation with tumor size and differentiation, but not with age, gender and lymphatic metastasis in gastric carcinoma. The more large in size and poorly in differentiation, the more low PIAS3 expression was.",
        "Loss of PIAS3 expression may be an important characteristic of gastric cancer and suggest vicious degree of the tumor."
