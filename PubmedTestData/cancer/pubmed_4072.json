        "The majority of progress made in pediatric oncology over the past 50 years has been achieved in the most common cancers. Rare pediatric cancers, which collectively comprise more than 10% of all pediatric cancers, pose multiple challenges to researchers and clinicians, all which stem from the infrequency of these cancers. There has been a tremendous increase in focus on rare pediatric cancers by international consortia and registries, disease-specific clinics, and divisions of academic children's hospitals in the last 10 years. This focus, along with the progress made in cancer genomics, has changed the landscape for the study and treatment of rare pediatric cancers. This review focuses on the past, present, and future of the study and treatment of rare pediatric cancers.",
        "Cancer genomics is changing the way some cancers are being diagnosed, categorized, and treated. Rare pediatric cancers potentially stand to greatly benefit from advances in precision diagnosis and treatment.",
        "The challenges of studying rare pediatric cancers are well known. By utilizing similar techniques that allowed for progress in the common pediatric malignancies, namely collaboration, increased focus, greater funding, and utilization of cancer genomics, progress in the study and treatment of rare pediatric cancers is promising."
