        "Expression of the non-coding RNA XIST is essential for initiating X chromosome inactivation (XCI) during early development in female mammals. As the main function of XCI is to enable dosage compensation of chromosome X genes between the sexes, XCI and XIST expression are generally absent in male normal tissues, except in germ cells and in individuals with supernumerary X chromosomes. Via a systematic analysis of public sequencing data of both cancerous and normal tissues, we report that XIST is somatically activated in a subset of male human cancers across diverse lineages. Some of these cancers display hallmarks of XCI, including silencing of gene expression, reduced chromatin accessibility, and increased DNA methylation across chromosome X, suggesting that the developmentally restricted, female-specific program of XCI can be somatically accessed in male cancers."
