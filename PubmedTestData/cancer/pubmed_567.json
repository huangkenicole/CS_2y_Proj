        "The objective of this review is to provide currently available information on the relationship between the gut microbiome and cancer.",
        "In this mini-review, we explored the PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar electronic databases, with regards to the searching terms \"gut microbiome, cancer, intestinal flora, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor\". By reviewing and analyzing the literature, we analyzed how the bacterial microbiome influences the immune system and cancer, as well as how changes in symbiotic flora may be applied to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",
        "The microbiota is related to the development of tumors and may promote canceration. In recent years, a number of studies have confirmed the influence of intestinal flora on immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients, and studies have also shown the link between the intestinal microbiome and treatment-related immune toxicity. Antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and hormones affect the composition of the gut microbiota.",
        "Intestinal flora is closely related to cancer. Intestinal flora has a certain impact on cancer occurrence, cancer treatment, cancer immunotherapy efficacy, and side effects."
