        "The blocking glue of cancerous serosa (F-TH glue) is unharmful to human body. It has characteristics of shorter solidification time to become membrane, good elasticity and close adherence to tissue, mainly used for covering cancerous serosa in operation to prevent dropping of cancer cells. In this group, F-TH glue was used in 200 cases of gastrointestinal cancer, in which 75 had positive results of imprinting slice of cancerous serosa, and all became negative. It was confirmed that the glue adhered to cancerous serosa firmly and formed intact protective membrane. No rhagades and dropping of glue were seem by naked eye magnifying glass and electron microscope. The membrane of glue forbid cancer cells not penetrated. It was an excellent glue to block the cancerous serosa."
