      "AbstractText": [
        "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common lung disorder. In this study, we applied bioinformatics methods to analyze and investigate the role of the NFIX gene in NSCLC. Hsa_circ_0049657 is derived from the NFIX gene, this research aimed to verify the potential role of hsa_circ_0049657 in the development of NSCLC. The results suggested that NFIX was downregulated in most cancers. In addition, the NFIX expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) was associated with the clinicopathological stage. In LUAD, NFIX expression was associated with the degree of infiltration of most immune cells. The expression levels of hsa_circ_0049657 were significantly lower in cancerous tissues than in paracancerous tissues. Moreover, the results showed that hsa_circ_0049657 expression was downregulated in NSCLC cells. After overexpression of hsa_circ_0049657, the proliferation and migration ability of NSCLC cells were significantly inhibited and the level of apoptosis was increased. We could suppress the proliferation and invasion abilities and promote apoptosis of NSCLC cells by up-regulating hsa_circ_0049657, which might be a potential biomarker for NSCLC."
