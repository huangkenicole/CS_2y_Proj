        "In China, there has been no established national program for cervical cancer prevention, the screening methods and experiences are especially deficient in the rural areas. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effects of acetic acid/Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) used for screening of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions in a rural area of China by analyzing the large-scale population-based screening data from the demonstration site.",
        "Women aged 30-59 years from Xiangyuan County in Shanxi Province were recruited for cervical cancer screening from 2005 to 2007. VIA/VILI was the primary screening method followed by colposcopy if the VIA/VILI was positive. Cervical lesions were diagnosed by directed biopsy under the colposcopy. The VIA/VILI negative women or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) were re-screened using the same procedure in the next year.",
        "In total, 7145 women received the cervical cancer screening, with a participation rate of 74.75%. Their average age was 42.16 years. A total of 1287 women were consecutively screened for three times from 2005 to 2007. The detection rates of CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer were 0.70% (9/1287), 1.01% (13/1287) and 0.23% (3/1287) for the first round screening, and were 0.22% (2/976), 0.11% (1/976) and 0% (0/976) for the second round screening, respectively. Only one CIN2 was found in the third round screening. In the years of 2006-2007, 3490 women were screened consecutively twice. The detection rates of CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer were 0.26% (9/3490), 0.52% (18/3490) and 0.15% (5/3490) for the first round screening, and 0.40% (14/2943), 0.40% (14/2943) and 0.03% (1/2943) for the second round screening. Likewise, 2 368 women were screened consecutively twice in the years of 2007-2008. The detection rates of CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer were 0.55% (13/2368), 0.25% (6/2368) and 0.12% (3/2368) for the first round screening, and 0.42 (10/2040), 0.04% (1/2040) and 0% for the second round screening. The cumulative detection rates for CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer were 0.81% (58/7145), 0.74% (53/7145) and 0.17% (12/7145), respectively. And 53.45% (31/58) of CIN2, 68.81% (37/53) of CIN3 and almost all cervical cancers (11/12) were found during the first round screening, except for an early stage cervical cancer (Ia). Only one CIN2 was detected in the third round screening in the same population. The average age of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical cancer were 38.65, 40.61, 44.10 and 46.73 years, respectively.",
        "VIA/VILI can be used as an alternative screening method for cervical cancer and high-grade pre-cancerous lesions among the women aged 30-59 years in China's rural areas because of its low cost, easy training for the local health providers, and less depending on facilities. One round screening by VIA/VILI can detect more than a half of CIN2, two-thirds of CIN3 and almost all the cervical cancer in the population, and the detection rates of CIN2/3 can be increased by two consecutive rounds of screening."
