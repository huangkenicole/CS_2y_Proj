        "The increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a typical feature of cancerous cells. This feature is closely associated with elevated oxidative stress inside solid tumour microenvironments, which thus impairs either the growth of cancer cells or their sensitivity to many cancer therapeutics. To date, numerous innovative strategies that target tumour H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have been designed for effective cancer treatment. More recently, with the rapid advancement of nanomedicine, several nanoreactors, which are highly efficient in converting endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to more toxic reactive oxygen species, promoting in situ H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or decomposing endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to molecular oxygen for tumour hypoxia attenuation, have been designed and attempted for effective cancer treatment. This review focuses on the latest progress of such innovative H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments. Afterwards, future perspectives on the development of tumour H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-driven nanoreactor-mediated cancer treatments and their potential clinical translations will be discussed."
