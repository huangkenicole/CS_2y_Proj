        "<b><i>Significance:</i></b> The 5-year survival rate of childhood cancers is now reaching 84%. However, treatments cause numerous acute and long-term side effects. These include cardiometabolic complications, namely hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and increased fat mass. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Many antineoplastic treatments can induce oxidative stress (OxS) and trigger an inflammatory response, which may cause acute and chronic side effects. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> Clinical studies have reported a state of heightened OxS and inflammation during cancer treatment in children as the result of treatment cytotoxic action on both cancerous and noncancerous cells. Higher levels of OxS and inflammation are associated with treatment side effects and with the development of cardiometabolic complications. Key nutrients (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary antioxidants, probiotics, and prebiotics) have the potential to modulate inflammatory and oxidative responses and, therefore, could be considered in the search for adverse complication prevention means as long as antineoplastic treatment efficiency is maintained. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> There is a need to better understand the relationship between cardiometabolic complications, OxS, inflammation and diet during pediatric cancer treatment, which represents the ultimate goal of this review. <i>Antioxid. Redox Signal</i>. 35, 293-318."
