        "Oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participate in formation of chronic inflammation states, which facilitate development of gastrointestinal tract tumors. Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of damage to cell membranes in result of exacerbated lipid peroxidation process. End products of lipid peroxidation (aldehydes, organic peroxides) react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins, cause changes in cell membrane structure and properties leading to loss of its integrity. Intensification of the lipid peroxidation process is a factor which may also lead to a malfunction in the antioxidant barrier, which further weakens the defense of cells against oxygen free radicals and promotes the onset and development of cancer. The aim of the study was the determination of lipid peroxidation level in gastrointestinal tract tumors (stomach, liver, colon, and colorectal cancer to liver metastases).",
        "Materials for studies were obtained from 150 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors: 10 with stomach cancer, 30 with malignant and benign liver cancers, 60 with primary colorectal cancer, and 50 with metachronous colorectal cancer liver metastases. We also investigated 25 patients with liver cirrhosis, which was treated as a pre-cancerous condition. In total, 175 patients were examined. Tumor specimens, and normal adjacent tissues (6-7 cm from the edge of the tumor), which served as control tissue in studies, were collected from patients (with their consent) during surgery. Additionally, liver specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis. Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products, which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid (TBA) form colour complex (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances - TBARS).",
        "The study showed the highest concentration of TBARS in benign, and the lowest in malignant liver tumors. Other types of gastrointestinal tumors studied, were characterized by similar levels of lipid peroxidation. TBARS concentration in these tumors was approximately 2-fold higher than in malignant liver tumors and much lower than in benign tumors. In all cancers of the digestive tract with the exception of malignant liver tumors increased level of TBARS was found, comparing with control tissue. The concentration of TBARS in cirrhotic liver was lower than in control. The level of lipid peroxidation in liver cirrhosis and malignant liver tumors was similar. There were no significant differences in TBARS concentration in the tumors of particular sections of the intestine and normal colon. The highest concentration of TBARS was found in G1 grade of colorectal cancer. In subsequent grades of cells differentiation (G2 and G3) its concentration was lower. The highest level of lipid peroxidation, expressed as the concentration of TBARS was found in the I stage of colorectal cancer clinical advancement. The significantly lowest concentration of TBARS was shown for stage II (UICC).",
        "The level of lipid peroxidation in cancerous cells of gastrointestinal tract indicates increased oxidative stress. The changes of lipid peroxidation level--a marker of oxidative stress in gastrointestinal tumors appear to be closely associated with their development stages (liver cirrhosis/malignant liver cancer; colorectal cancer/colorectal cancer liver metastases) and are likely to create such conditions, in which cancerous cells may proliferate, undergo gradual dedifferentiation and malignancy, and generate metastases."
