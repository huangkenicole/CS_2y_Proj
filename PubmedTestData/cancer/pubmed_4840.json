        "The possible elevation of phosphorous (P) in cancer patients blood serum has been reported in the past. This however seems to have passed unnoticed. One hundred individuals, divided into two groups of fifty each, i.e. cancer patients (group A) and healthy individuals (group B), were included in this retrospective study. The incidence of cancer by site in group A was 24% head and neck, 50% non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 26% cervical cancer. In all cancer patients in group A the serum P was over the normal values, in contrast with the normal values of P measured in group B. The mean value of serum P in group A and B were 7.80 (\u00b1 2.24) and 3.38 (\u00b1 0.58), respectively (P<0.001, Mann Whitney test). Increased amount of phosphorus in the blood, when other causes justifying the increase were excluded, should be considered as indicative for the existence of unidentified cancerous lesions."
