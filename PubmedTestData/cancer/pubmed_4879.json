        "The role of family history in the multiple occurrence of cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) remains unclear. The family histories of close relatives were examined in 167 patients with either hypopharyngeal or cervical esophageal cancer (PhCe cancer) and in 167 control subjects with benign diseases. The odds ratio for PhCe cancer was 2.6 in relation to family history of UADT cancers. Based on the family histories of close relatives, 167 cases with PhCe cancer were divided into 3 groups (Group I, 18 cases with a family history of UADT cancer; Group II, 37 cases with a family history of other cancers; Group III, 112 cases with no family history of any cancers). The mean age of the cases in group I was 59.4, which was younger than in group III (64.2). Second primary squamous-cell carcinomas in the UADT were more frequently recognized in group I (39%) than in group III (11%). However, no differences were observed in the smoking and drinking habits of male patients between each group. These results thus suggest that a family history of UADT cancers appears to be associated with the multiple occurrence of UADT cancers as well as the development of PhCe cancer."
