        "Lay abstract Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer. Many genes are thought to be linked to the development of cancers. We looked at key genes in lung adenocarcinoma by analyzing public databases. Five key genes, including <i>CHEK1</i>, were found. The amount of <i>CHEK1</i> was higher in lung adenocarcinoma than in normal lung cells. The presence of a large amount of <i>CHEK1</i> was linked to poor survival in people with lung adenocarcinoma. Also, <i>CHEK1</i> was mainly expressed in some specific tumor cell clusters rather than in all tumor cell clusters. The clusters with <i>CHEK1</i> expression were more cancerous compared with other clusters. Overall, <i>CHEK1</i> might be a potential marker to predict survival in people with lung adenocarcinoma."

        "<b>Aim:</b> The study aims to pinpoint hub genes and investigate their functions in order to gain insightful understandings of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). <b>Methods:</b> Bioinformatic approaches were adopted to investigate genes in databases including Gene Expression Omnibus, WebGestalt, STRING and Cytoscape, GEPIA2, Oncomine, Human Protein Atlas, TIMER2.0, UALCAN, cBioPortal, TargetScanHuman, OncomiR, ENCORI, Kaplan-Meier plotter, UCSC Xena, European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute Single Cell Expression Atlas and CancerSEA. <b>Results:</b> Five hub genes were ascertained. <i>CHEK1</i> was overexpressed in a range of cancers, including LUAD. Promoter methylation, amplification and miRNA regulation might trigger <i>CHEK1</i> upregulation, signaling poor prognosis. <i>CHEK1</i> with its coexpressed genes were enriched in the cell cycle pathway. Intratumor heterogeneity of <i>CHEK1</i> expression could be observed. Cell clusters with <i>CHEK1</i> expression were more prone to metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CHEK1</i> might potentially act as a prognostic biomarker for LUAD."
