      "AbstractText": [
        "Highly supported microRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in cancer development. Each of these miRNAs may act as an oncomir, a tumor-suppressor, or both in various cancers. Mir-151a-5p is believed to be one of these miRNAs with diverse roles. We have conducted this systematic review to clarify the role of mir-151a-5p in formation of various cancers.",
        "We searched for existing articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, and RNAcentral databases up to November 2022. A total of 23 articles were qualified and included in the present systematic review. This review is registered on JBI at https://jbi.global/systematic-review-register. Expression levels, diagnostic and prognostic values, biological processes, and targeted downstream genes are included.",
        "Assembled data indicate the expression levels of mir-151a-5p vary from down- to up-regulated based on the type of the cancer. Its functional role depends on the genetic profile of cancerous tissue. Results mostly point to the oncogenic role of this miRNA in Pituitary adenomas, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Endometrial, Lung, Barrett's carcinogenesis, Colorectal, Myelodysplastic syndromes, Hepatocellular carcinoma and Breast cancers, as its inhibited targets seem to be controlling several signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and cell cycle. At the same time, tumor-suppressing role has also been observed only in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, Central Nerve System (CNS) lymphoma, Chronic Myeloid and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Two types of cancers, prostate and colon, show contradictory results as there are studies supporting both up- and down-regulation in these cancers. Pituitary adenomas, Barrett's carcinogenesis and CNS lymphomas are top cancers diagnosed with mir-151-5p. However, prognostic feature is only applicable to Lung adenocarcinoma.",
        "Based on the present findings and further studies in the future, mir-151a-5p may be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or even a therapeutic target in cancer studies.",
        "The articles used in this study can be found with the defined search phrase in mentioned databases. A list of selected articles will be available on reasonable requests."
