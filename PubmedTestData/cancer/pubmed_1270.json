        "The incidence of cancer of mesopharynx is not so high in Japan. Age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 population of this tumor is 0.2 (0.4 in male, 0.1 in female) in Japan. The mesopharyngeal tumors contain three types: squamous cell carcinoma from squamous epithelium, malignant lymphoma from Waldeyer's tonsillar ring and adenocarcinoma from minor salivary glands. The squamous cell carcinoma is most frequent in patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years, males being affected 5-10 times as frequently as females. Epidermiologically, cancerization of mesopharynx is dependent on heavy smoking and drinking. Because of the high incidence of regional neck node metastases at initial examination, combined therapy with radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, composite operation and reconstructive surgery must be done in co-operation with surgeon and radiation therapist, working as a team. Survival rates of this tumor are 30-40%."
