        "In this study, pre- and post-operative serum activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and total superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes were measured in patients with squamous cell laryngeal cancer. Activities of both enzymes were found to be higher in cancerous patients compared to the controls. No significant differences were found however between pre- and post-operative values for both enzymes in the patient group. It has been suggested that ADA and SOD enzymes leak from the cancerous laryngeal tissues into the blood stream. The absence of differences between pre- and post-operative serum enzyme activities has two possible explanations: Firstly, removal of previously released enzymes from the blood stream takes a much longer period than one month; and secondly, cancerous laryngeal tissue is not the only source of the enzymes mentioned even after removal of cancerous tissue by surgical operation, other sources such as adjacent tissues and/or metastatic tissues etc, still release these enzymes into the blood stream."
