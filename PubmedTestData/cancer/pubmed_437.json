        "Nanoparticles are being researched as a noninvasive method for selectively killing cancer cells. With particular antibody coatings on nanoparticles, they attach to the abnormal cells of interest (cancer or otherwise). Once attached, nanoparticles can be heated with ultraviolet-visible/infrared or radiofrequency pulses, heating the surrounding area of the cell to its point of death. Researchers often use single-pulse or multi-pulse modes of laser heating when conducting nanoparticle ablation research. In this article, time-dependent simulations and detailed analyses are carried out for different nonstationary pulsed laser-nanoparticle interaction modes, and the advantages and disadvantages of single-pulse and multi-pulse (set of short pulses) laser heating of nanoparticles are shown. Simulations are performed for the metal nanoparticles in the biological surrounding medium as well as for healthy and cancerous cell organelles.",
        "External laser pulses can be used to generate heating of targeted metal nanoparticles for thermal ablation therapy of cancers, however the approach used in individual studies is idiosyncratic. In this manuscript, time-dependent simulations and analyses are used to determine the pros and cons of single versus multiple laser pulses for differential impact of healthy versus cancerous cell organelles."
