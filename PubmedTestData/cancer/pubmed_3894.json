        "The transformation in cells at genetic levels stimulatesthe proliferation of cancer. The current review highlights the role of miRNA in management of cancer by altering processes of body at cellular levels.",
        "A deep research on the literature available till date for miRNA in cancer was conducted using various medical sites like PubMed, MEDLINE from internet and data was collected. The articles were majorly preferred in English language.",
        "The development of normal cells into cancerous cells is a multivalent procedure highlighting numerous responsible factors. During the progression of cancer, the role of oncogene and tumor suppressor genes outshines at different levels of tumorogenesis. Metastasis poses highest threat in cancer progression and fabricates obstacles to clinicians and researchers in preventing formation of tumor on secondary sites. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induce dissemination and ultimately progression of cancer.",
        "A comprehensive knowledge of the altered genes and the mechanism by which they induce formation of tumor is essential as they contribute in proliferating cancer at various stages, aggravating clinical symptoms. Hence miRNAs can be efficiently employed as an emerging treatment therapy for cancer."
