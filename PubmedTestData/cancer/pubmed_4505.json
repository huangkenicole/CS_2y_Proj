        "This study estimates the burden of cancer in Korea during 2000-2020, ameliorating the Global Burden of Disease Study Group (GBD) method with the Incidence-Prevalence-Mortality (IPM) Model.",
        "Besides using the GBD approach to calculate the Years of Life Lost in Korea during 2000-2020, this research calculates the Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) of major cancers based on the combination of the GBD method and the IPM Model.",
        "Colon, breast and thyroid cancers became more significant in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years during 2000-2010 and this will continue during 2010-2020, colon cancer leading the pack instead of stomach cancer in 2020. The rise of colon cancer is more evident for the older age group and the opposite is true for breast and thyroid cancers. Indeed, stomach and liver cancers were resilient in terms of DALYs during 2000-2010 and this will continue during 2010-2020. Overall, the burden of cancer in Korea is characterized by an increasing centrality of YLDs (chronic components) as in other advanced nations.",
        "Korea's convergence with other advanced nations in cancer burden might reflect their convergence in living standards, the age structure, health behavior and medical technology during the past four decades. These transitions have been reflected in the Second 10-Year Plan for Cancer Control in Korea during 2006-2015, government policy consisting of four main programs, i.e., primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis/treatment and palliative care."
