        "Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, especially within the past few decades, causing over half a million deaths a year in the USA only [1]. Despite recent advances made in the field of cancer biology and the therapies that have been developed, it is clear that more advances are necessary for us to classify cancer as curable. The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a cure eluded us? This chapter will shed light on one of cancer\u2019s most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest known diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells\u2019 rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives them the advantage over our immune systems. In this chapter, we will delve into the complexities of this adaptability and the vital role that metabolism plays in the rise and progression of this heterogeneity."
