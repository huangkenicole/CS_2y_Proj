        "This is a retrospective study examining survival of patients undergoing repeat hepatic resection for recurrent colorectal metastases.",
        "The records of 41 patients undergoing hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer were reviewed. Curative resections (negative resection margin and no extrahepatic disease) were attempted in all patients. Recurrence developed in 26 (63%) patients, with disease being confined to the liver in 16 (39%) patients. Ten of them (24%) underwent hepatic resection and make up the study population.",
        "Ten patients (4 women, 6 men; mean age: 62 years, range: 50-82 years) developed recurrence confined to the liver at the median interval of 16 months (range: 5-34 months) after the first hepatectomy. In 6 patients the recurrent cancer(s) involved both the area near the resection line and remote sites from the site of the first hepatic resection. In 3 patients recurrent cancer(s) was located at sites remote from the first liver resection. In 1 patient the recurrent cancer was located in the same area as the original hepatic resection. Three formal hepatectomies and seven non-anatomical (wedge) resections were performed. The mean blood loss was 900 cc (range: 100-2700 cc); the mean hospital stay was 19 days (range: 8-34 days). There was no perioperative mortality. Morbidity was 20%. Four patients died of recurrent disease, with a mean disease-free survival of 13 months (range: 5-21 months). Two patients had a second recurrence resected at 10 and 24 months, respectively, after the second hepatic resection. One of these 2 patients had a fourth hepatic resection for hepatic recurrence and is still alive with no evidence of disease. Six patients are alive, 4 of them without evidence of disease, with a median follow-up time of 30 months (range: 22-64 months). Actuarial 4-year specific survival was 44%. Actuarial disease-free survival at 4 years was 18%.",
        "In appropriately selected patients, repeat hepatic resection for colorectal metastases is a worthwhile treatment. Mortality, morbidity, and survival are similar to those following the initial resection."
