        "Very few studies have compared the epidemiological characteristics of patients with familial colorectal cancer Type X (FCCTX) with those of sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC). The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological characteristics and survival between FCCTX and S-CRC in patients from a historically isolated geographical region.",
        "A retrospective study was carried out of patients with S-CRC and FCCTX treated in the Canary Islands. Family and personal history of colorectal cancer (CRC) were recorded, together with genetic (microsatellite instability), immunohistochemical and clinical variables.",
        "Forty-eight (10.6%) of 451 patients were classified as FCCTX and the remaining 403 (89.4%) as S-CRC. Age at the diagnosis of tumour was significantly lower in FCCTX than in S-CRC (64.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.65\u00a0years vs 69.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.80 years; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; Z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.48). Patients with FCCTX had a larger number of synchronous tumours (P\u00a0=\u00a00.09). Recurrence was significantly higher in FCCTX than in S-CRC (18.7% vs 8.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Survival correlated significantly with the number of first-degree and second-degree relatives with CRC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; OR:\u00a01.368, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84, and P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; OR:\u00a01.363, 95% CI: 1.08-1.65) and with the total number of cases of CRC in the immediate family (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; OR:\u00a01.377, 95% CI: 1.17-1.61). Recurrence-free time was significantly lower in patients with FCCTX (log-rank\u00a0=\u00a00.01).",
        "Significant differences were found in several demographic and clinicopathological variables between patients with FCCTX and patients with S-CRC. These included increased tumour presentation under the age of 50\u00a0years and a higher recurrence rate in patients with FCCTX, suggesting an increased risk of CRC in this group."
