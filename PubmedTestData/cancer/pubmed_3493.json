        "A cohort of head and neck cancer patients, without exposure to tobacco and alcohol, presented with multiple preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, the natural history of which may span several decades. Examination of these cases provides an opportunity to study the relationship between genetic, morphological, and clonal progression in these fields and establish whether they represent a unique presentation of squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of a common novel microsatellite allele, a common breakpoint or concordant allelic imbalance at multiple loci, reveals that a high proportion of these serial lesions arise due to spread of a precursor. The tumors arising in these patients were typically nonaggressive, although metastases developed at a late stage, supporting the notion that the genotype results in a phenotype with a propensity for lateral spread, rather than invasion. Different genetic aberrations were detected in morphologically similar phenotypes such that no consistent early or late events were associated with development of premalignant lesions. Combining information about the clinicopathological features and histological examination of the margins with that derived from clonality analysis reveals that a subgroup of patients, without exposure to the traditional risk factors associated with this disease, developed multiple clonally related oral lesions and represents a unique presentation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We suggest the term clonal cancerization to describe multiple premalignant and malignant lesions when there is conclusive evidence that they arise due to lateral spread from a common precursor."
