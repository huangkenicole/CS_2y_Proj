        "Tumor eradication is one of the most important challengeable categories in oncological studies. In this account, besides the molecular genetics methods including cell therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and general cancer therapy procedures like surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, photodynamic adjuvant therapy is of great importance. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a relatively noninvasive therapeutic method utilizes the irradiation of an appropriate wavelength which is absorbed by a photosensitizing agent in the presence of oxygen. In this procedure, a series of events lead to the direct death of malignant cells such as damage to the microvasculature and also the induction of a local inflammatory function. PDT has participated with other treatment modalities especially in the early stage of malignant tumors and has resulted in decreasing morbidity besides improving survival rate and quality of life. High spatial resolution of PDT has attracted considerable attention in the field of image-guided photodynamic therapy combined with chemotherapy of multidrug resistance cancers. Although PDT outcomes vary across the different tumor types, minimal natural tissue toxicity, minor systemic effects, significant reduction in long-term disease, lack of innate or acquired resistance mechanisms, and excellent cosmetic effects, as well as limb function, make it a valuable treatment option for combination therapies.",
        "In this review article, we tried to discuss the potential of PDT in the treatment of some dermatologic and solid tumors, particularly all its important mechanisms."
