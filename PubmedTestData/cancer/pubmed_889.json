        "To explore the potential significance of expression of CD44 and RHAMM at different stages of gastric carcinogenesis.",
        "The expression pattern of CD44 and RHAMM in non-cancerous mucosa, preneoplastic lesions and carcinomas of the stomach was examined by RT-PCR, Southern blot hybridization, immunohistochemical staining and Western blot hybridization.",
        "Expression of CD44 v5 could be observed not only in cancers, but also in pre-neoplastic and non-cancerous specimens. CD44 v7 was commonly seen in non-cancerous lesions but its expression tended to decrease with the progression of pre-malignant phenotype. CD44 v8-v10 could only be observed in some intestinal metaplasia, dysplastic proliferation and undifferentiated carcinoma. Nevertheless, CD44 v6 was found exclusively in cancer tissues, with a positive rate of 14%. The frequency of RHAMM detection was about 10% in non-cancerous mucosa but tended to increase with tumor development, reaching an average of 74% in gastric cancers. In 80% of the invading cancer cells, RHAMM and CD44v coexpressed, or complementarily expressed.",
        "Expression of RHAMM is more associated with progression of gastric malignancy. Irrespective of its low frequency, CD44 v6 is still a reliable marker of malignant transformation of gastric mucosa. Co-expression or complementary expression of CD44v and RHAMM might facilitate invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer."
