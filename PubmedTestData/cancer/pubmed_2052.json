        "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, followed by cancer. Angiotensin II contributes greatly to CVD pathogenesis, and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute a mainstay in hypertension and CVD management. However, the relationship between ARBs and cancer initiation is controversial, with no clear data in Lebanon. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the association between ARBs intake and lung, bladder, and colorectal cancers development in the Lebanese population. A retrospective study was conducted on 709 subjects divided into 2 main groups: Control (subjects without cancer; n = 177), and Cases (patients with cancer (n = 532): lung, bladder, or colorectal), taking ARBs (n = 236, (n = 121 in control and n = 115 in cases)) or not (n = 473). Collected information included the patients demographics, comorbidities, cancer's risk factors, and ARBs dose and duration intake. Bivariate, multivariate, and binary logistic analyses were enrolled. ARBs use was significantly protective (P value = 0.000) against overall cancer development (odds ratio [OR] = 0.127) and against each, lung (OR < 1), bladder (OR < 1), and colorectal cancers (OR < 1). A duration-response relationship was established. This protective effect and the time-dependent relationship remained unchanged after omitting the most relevant risk factors. In summary, a significant overall protective effect of ARBs against lung, bladder and colorectal cancers was found. This beneficial response was time-dependent. These results can guide patients on treatment options and clinicians for informed decision-making."
