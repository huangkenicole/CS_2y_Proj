      "AbstractText": [
        "Lung, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were the six most common and highly fatal cancers for Japanese men in Japan in 2003, while for women uterine cervical cancer could also be added to this list. To identify diagnostic or therapeutic biomarkers for these cancers, investigators are nowadays performing proteomic analyses of cancer tissues and cells, and revealing a large number of molecules which are diagnostic, prognostic and informative of carcinogenesis. From reports of proteomic analyses of cancerous tissues and noncancerous tissues sampled from HCC, and pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung and uterine cervical cancers, we classified the proteins into digestive enzymes, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, calcium-binding proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, transporter proteins, structural molecules, apoptosis inhibitor, molecular chaperone, as well as proteins related to cell growth, cell differentiation, cell transformation, tumor invasion, carcinogen metabolism, and others. The aim of this study was to understand carcinogenesis of major cancers from a proteomics perspective using samples from cancer patients, and to elucidate their tumor biomarkers."
