        "To explore the interaction between folate and the expression of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2(MeCP2)in cervical cancerization.",
        "Forty one patients diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma(SCC), 71 patients diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm(CIN1, n=34; CIN2 +, n=37)and 61 women with normal cervix(NC)were recruited in this study. Microbiological assay was conducted to detect the levels of serum folate and RBC folate, Western blot assay and real-time PCR were performed to detect the expression levels of MeCP2 protein and mRNA, respectively. The data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis H test, \u03c7(2) test, trend \u03c7(2) test and Spearman correlation with SPSS statistical software(version 20.0), and the interaction were evaluated by using generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction(GMDR)model.",
        "The levels of serum folate(H=44.71, P<0.001; trend \u03c7(2)=24.48, P<0.001)and RBC folate(H=5.28, P<0.001; trend \u03c7(2)=3.83, P<0.05)decreased gradually along with the severity of cervical lesions. There was a positive correlation between serum folate level and RBC folate level(r=0.270, P< 0.001). The expression levels of MeCP2 protein(H=33.72, P<0.001; trend \u03c7(2)=14.74, P<0.001)and mRNA(H=19.50, P<0.001; trend \u03c7(2)=10.74, P<0.001)increased gradually along with the severity of cervical lesions. There were negative correlation between folate level and the expression level of MeCP2 protein(serum folate: r=-0.226, P=0.003; RBC folate: r=-0.164, P=0.004). Moreover, the results by GMDR model revealed there were interaction among serum folate deficiency, RBC folate deficiency, MeCP2 protein high expression and MeCP2 mRNA high expression in SCC and CIN2 + patients.",
        "Folate deficiency and high expression of MeCP2 gene might increase the risk of cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions through interaction among serum folate deficiency, RBC folate deficiency, MeCP2 protein high expression and mRNA high expression in the progression of cervical cancerization."
