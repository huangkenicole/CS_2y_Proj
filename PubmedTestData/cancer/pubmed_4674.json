        "Pakistan has been systematically collecting cancer data since 1994 through cancer registries.",
        "This article presents a comprehensive analysis of cancer statistics in Pakistan from 1994 to 2021, including incidence and patterns.",
        "The total number of patients with malignant neoplasm was 111,941, and the number of patients registered was 109,863. Most patients were from Punjab (67.6%) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (20.2%). Breast cancer (22.2%), colorectum cancer (5.6%), leukemia (5.3%), lip and oral cavity cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5.1%) were the top five prevalent cancers in all age groups and sexes. Breast (24.2%), colorectum (6.2%), lip and oral cavity (5.8%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.4%), and prostate cancers (4.0%) were most common in adults in both sexes. In both sexes, the most common cancers among children were Hodgkin lymphoma (20.1%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (19.8%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (11.6%), osteosarcoma (7.0%), and retinoblastoma (6.2%). Breast (45.9%), ovary and uterine adnexa (4.9%), lip and oral cavity (4.2%), cervix uteri (4.0%), and colorectum cancers (3.9%) were most common in adult females. In adult males, colorectum cancer (8.7%), prostate cancer (8.5%), lip and oral cavity cancer (7.6%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6.4%), and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers were the top five most common malignancies.",
        "It has been found that breast cancer, colorectum cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, and bone cancer rates are among the highest in Pakistan. This information may be useful in assessing the effectiveness of future intervention strategies."
