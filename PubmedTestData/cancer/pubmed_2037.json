        "Laryngeal carcinoma is still a worldwide burden that has shown no significant improvement during the last few decades regarding definitive treatment strategies. The lack of suitable biomarkers for personalized treatment protocols and delineating field cancerization prevents further progress in clinical outcomes. In the light of this perspective, MicroRNAs could be promising biomarkers both in terms of diagnostic and prognostic value. The aim of this prospective study is to find strong prognostic microRNA biomarkers for advanced laryngeal carcinoma and molecular signatures of field cancerization. Sixty patients were enrolled and four samples were collected from each patient: tumor surface and depth, peritumor normal mucosa, and control distant laryngeal mucosa. Initially, a global microRNA profile was conducted in twelve patients from the whole cohort and subsequently, we validated a selected group of 12 microRNAs with RT-qPCR. The follow-up period was 24\u00a0months (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0months). Microarray expression profile revealed 59 dysregulated microRNAs. The validated expression levels of miR-93-5p (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>(2)\u2009=\u20094.68, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.03), miR-144-3p (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>(2)\u2009=\u20094.53, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.03) and miR-210-3p (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>(2)\u2009=\u20094.53, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.03) in tumor samples exhibited strong association with recurrence-free survival as higher expression levels of these genes predict worse outcome. Tumor suppressor genes miR-144-3p (mean rank 1.58 vs 2.14 vs 2.29, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and miR-145-5p (mean rank 1.57 vs 2.15 vs 2.28, p\u2009=\u20090.000) were significantly dysregulated in peritumor mucosa with a pattern of expression consistent with paired tumor samples thus revealing a signature of field cancerization in laryngeal carcinoma. Additionally, miR-1260b, miR-21-3p, miR-31-3p and miR-31-5p were strongly associated with tumor grade. Our study reports the first global microRNA profile specifically in advanced laryngeal carcinoma that includes survival analysis and investigates the molecular signature of field cancerization. We report two strong biomarkers of field cancerization and three predictors for recurrence in advance stage laryngeal cancer."
