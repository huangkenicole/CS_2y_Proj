        "Nuclear Matrix Proteins (NMP) have been shown to be tissue and cell-type specific. Several unique NMPs have been investigated in various cancerous tissues, including prostate, bladder and kidney, and some are presently utilized as tumor markers. This study was aimed at characterizing the differential NMP expression in the pathologically more aggressive prostate cancers.",
        "High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and silver staining was used to elucidate the NMP distribution of fresh prostate cancer nuclei, obtained from 39 radical prostatectomy specimens, surgically removed from men with clinically localized prostate cancer. Based on the final pathological grading, specimens were grouped according to predicted prognosis: poor--with seminal vesicle (SV) or lymph node (LN) involvement or established capsular penetration (ECP) with gleason score >7; intermediate--organ confined (OC) or focal capsular penetration (FCP) with gleason score 7 or ECP with gleason score 6; and good--with OC or FCP and gleason score <7.",
        "A specific charged protein (YL-1) of molecular weight 76 kD and isoelectric range 6.0-6.6 was found to be consistently present in 19 of 19 aggressive cancers. It was present only in 1 of 10 in the group with good prognosis and weakly positive in 9 of 10 in the intermediate group.",
        "Within this preliminary study, the expression of YL-1 appears to be related to aggressive prostate cancer, suggesting a potential marker of poor prognosis for clinically localized prostate cancer. Further characterization of the identity and function of this NMP is needed to fully ascertain its clinical potential."
