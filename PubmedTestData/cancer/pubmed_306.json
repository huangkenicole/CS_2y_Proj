        "This retrospective study aims at comparing the variation of peripheral inflammatory markers in recurrent and cancerous vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) and at exploring the potential connection with pathological outcomes.",
        "The patients undergoing carbon dioxide laser surgery with postoperative pathological diagnosis of recurrent vocal fold leukoplakia in the last 5 years were included. The clinical data were collected, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) before and after recurrence and canceration were calculated. Related comparison with two-grade pathological classification was made to evaluate their potential connection with postsurgical histopathology and clinical events.",
        "The data of 193 patients were engaged into research, as 111 in the recurrence group (Group A) and 82 in canceration group (Group B). The NLR, PLR, and MLR were significantly increased in canceration event compared to the first (<i>P</i> = 0.009, 0.004, 0.007, respectively) and penultimate (<i>P</i> = 0.013, 0.041, 0.006, respectively) time when the previous pathologies were leukoplakia. When redividing the Group A according to the two-grade pathological classification, the high-risk groups showed statistically higher NLR and PLR values than low-risk groups in the subgroups with grade changing (<i>P</i> = 0.016, 0.005, 0.007, 0.005, respectively) and subgroups without grade changing (<i>P</i> = 0.020, 0.027, 0.030, 0.029, respectively).",
        "NLR, PLR, and MLR are reliable biomarkers in the circulation system which show significantly interrelation with the pathological progression of vocal fold leukoplakia. Presurgical evaluation of NLR, PLR, and MLR may have potential values to indicate the following treatment in clinical practice."
