        "To evaluate women with atypical glandular cells (AGC) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) on cytology.",

        "Cancer was diagnosed in 107 out of 199 patients (54%) with AGC or AIS; 30 with cervical adenocarcinoma and 77 with endometrial cancer. All women with endometrial cancer were 50 years or older. In women younger than 50 years, cervical pre-cancerous lesions were found in 44 (47%) and cervical adenocarcinoma in 24 out of 92 cases (26%). High-risk HPV infection was found in 62 out of 103 women (60%). The detection rate of high-risk HPV at finding histopathological AGC, AIS, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cervical cancer was 98% (95% confidence interval=0.903-1.000) (54/55).",
        "AGC or AIS indicates endometrial neoplasia in women 50 years or older and pre-cancerous or invasive glandular cervical lesions in younger women. HPV testing seems to identify underlying cervical adenocarcinoma and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions."
