        "Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that has been used in cancer diagnostic because of its specific cell-cycle dependent expression profile. After quantifying and characterising the expression level of Ki-67, as a function of the cell cycle, we found out that the two main splice variants of the protein (i.e. \u03b1 and \u03b2) are differently regulated in non-cancerous and cancerous cells both at mRNA and protein level. We were able to correlate the presence of the \u03b1 variant of the protein with the progression through the interphase of cell cycle. We also observed that the different expression profiles correspond to different degradation pathways for non-cancerous and cancerous cells. Furthermore, Ki-67 is continuously regulated and degraded via proteasome system in both cell types, suggesting an active control of the protein. However we also observed a putative extranuclear elimination pathway of Ki-67 where it is transported to the Golgi apparatus. Our evidence in the different expression of the splice variants may represent a milestone for the development of new targets for cancer diagnostic and prognostic. Additionally, the unexpected extranuclear elimination of Ki-67 strongly suggests that this protein must be looked at also outside of the \"nuclear box\", as thought to date."
