        "Like other gynecologic malignancies, cervical cancer is classified by the anatomic location and extent of the tumor. Because clinical variables such as patients' symptoms, symptom severity, and comorbidity may indicate a cancer's biologic virulence and the host-tumor interaction, this study was performed to test the hypothesis that clinical variables will also affect survival of patients with stage IB cervical cancer.",
        "From medical records of 251 cases of invasive cervical cancer treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital between 1984 and 1988, information was extracted for patients' demographic characteristics, symptoms, symptom severity, comorbidity, physical findings, laboratory data, treatment, and subsequent course.",
        "In the 122 available cases of stage IB cervical cancer the overall 3-year survival rate was 79%. For a composite clinical predictive system on the basis of symptom status and comorbidity, the 3-year survival rates were as follows: symptomatic patients with comorbidity 58% (seven of 12), either symptomatic or comorbid but not both 77% (46/60), and asymptomatic patients without comorbidity 86% (43/50) (p = 0.02 for linear trend chi 2). When entered into a Cox proportional-hazard model along with other variables that might have an impact on prognosis, the composite symptom-comorbidity stage was the only variable that remained statistically significant.",
        "These findings demonstrate the importance of clinical variables in estimating prognosis in stage IB cervical cancer. Unless these variables are suitably analyzed, prognostic estimates based only on morphologic studies will be imprecise and therapeutic evaluations may be misleading."
