        "Certain genetic peculiarities recently identified in cancer cells have generally been regarded as the abnormalities responsible for cancer development. However, these abnormalities may also be found in maturable cancer cells and are not limited only to the non-maturable type. As previously described by the authors, cancer tissue consists of two types of cancerous cells: maturable and non-maturable. The development of cancer may be dependent only on the non-maturable cancerous stem cells, not on the maturable type. Since the non-maturable cell may be solely responsible for carcinogenesis, the relevant genetic peculiarities that are also found in the maturable cancer cells should not be regarded as the abnormalities responsible for carcinogenesis."
