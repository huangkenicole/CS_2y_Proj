      "AbstractText": [
        "Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor used for treating unresectable or metastatic cancers, including thyroid cancer. As total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine therapy is a commonly recommended initial treatment for thyroid cancer, histological findings of the thyroid after lenvatinib therapy remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse in-vivo changes in patients who underwent thyroidectomy after lenvatinib therapy.",
        "We screened 167 patients with thyroid cancer [papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), n\u2009=\u2009102; follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), n\u2009=\u200926; anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), n\u2009=\u200939] who underwent lenvatinib therapy. Among these patients, six underwent thyroidectomy (lenvatinib-treated group: PTC, n\u2009=\u20093; FTC, n\u2009=\u20091; ATC, n\u2009=\u20092), and the specimens were examined. Five patients with PTC who did not receive lenvatinib therapy were included for comparison (untreated group). Microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated in both groups. The PTC and FTC specimens showed relatively more ischaemic changes than ATC specimens. Coagulative necrosis and ischaemic changes in cancer cells were frequently observed. ATC specimens showed fibrosis and mild cell damage. As hypothyroidism is a common side effect of lenvatinib therapy, non-cancerous thyroid tissues were also examined. Histological findings included mild lymphocytic infiltration, lymphoid follicular formation, histiocytic reaction and follicular epithelial destruction. The MVD in lenvatinib-treated tissues was significantly lower than that in untreated tissues.",
        "Lenvatinib therapy probably induces relatively specific ischaemic changes in thyroid cancer cells. Moreover, inflammatory cell infiltration and decreased MVD occur to varying degrees in non-cancerous thyroid tissue and may be related to hypothyroidism, a side effect of lenvatinib."
