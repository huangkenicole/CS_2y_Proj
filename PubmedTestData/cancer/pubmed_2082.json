        "Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common cancer affecting many regions of the world and carries significant morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review the key risk factors and their associated impact on the changing incidence and prevalence of EC subtypes within different global regions. We also highlight potential reasons for the ever-changing epidemiology of this prevalent cancer type.",
        "There has been a shift in incidence of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (AC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) within certain populations primarily due to an increase prevalence of primary risk factors. In Western nations, more often the United States, there has been a shift from SCC predominance to the majority of new cases of EC being adenocarcinoma. This shift within the United States has largely correlated with a rise in obesity. The prevalence of AC in Asia is also starting to rise as more countries adopt a western diet. The pathophysiology, associated risk factors, and presentation of ESCC and AC are different. This difference is seen in varying lifestyles, population health, and certain genetic risks. With further development closer analysis of primary risk factors and implementation of policies and programs that promote public health literacy, there is a potential to decrease esophageal cancer's global disease burden."
