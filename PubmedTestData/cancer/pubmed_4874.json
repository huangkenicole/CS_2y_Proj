        "MT1-MMP exhibits diverse expressions in patients with cancer and could be considered as potential prognostic biomarker of cancer. We performed a meta-analysis aiming to provide more sufficient evidence that MT1-MMP expression is associated with poor overall survival in several types of cancers. We systematically searched the studies from databases and carefully identified based on eligibility criteria. The association between MT1-MMP expression and overall survival in cancers was estimated using Review Manager. A total of 11 literatures which included 1,918 cancer patients were combined in the final analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that MT1-MMP overexpression was associated with an unfavorable overall survival and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) was 2.46 (95\u00a0% CI 1.75-3.47). From subgroup analyses, we identified that MT1-MMP was an independent prognostic factor for lung cancer and gastric cancer, and HRs (95\u00a0% CI) were 3.73 (95\u00a0% CI 2.67-5.21) and 2.46 (95\u00a0% CI 1.69-3.59), respectively. In conclusion, MT1-MMP is a potential prognostic factor in human cancers."
