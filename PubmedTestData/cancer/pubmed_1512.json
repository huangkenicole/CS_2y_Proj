        "As valuable members of the oncology team, acute care nurse practitioners (ACNPs) are in the perfect position to deliver high-quality palliative care. They are instrumental in coordinating the palliative care needs of their patients. Through proper training, ACNPs are able to assess, plan, implement, and evaluate palliative care interventions. Along with oncology-certified nurses, ACNPs help their patients navigate the complexities of the healthcare system. The skills that the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer identified in its standard for palliative care are skills possessed by ACNPs, making them the perfect fit to carry out these standards in healthcare institutions around the United States."
