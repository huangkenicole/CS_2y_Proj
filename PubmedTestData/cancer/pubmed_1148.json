        "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is derived from the bacterial innate immune system and engineered as a robust gene-editing tool. Due to the higher specificity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9, it has been widely applied to many genetic and non-genetic disease, including cancers, genetic hemolytic diseases, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, ocular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, and some X-linked diseases. Furthermore, in terms of the therapeutic strategy of cancers, many researchers used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to cure or alleviate cancers through different approaches, such as gene therapy and immune therapy.",
        "Here, we conclude the recent application and clinical trials of CRISPR/Cas9 in non-cancerous diseases and cancers and pointed out some of the problems to be solved.",
        "CRISPR/Cas9, derived from the microbial innate immune system, is developed as a robust gene-editing tool and has been applied widely. Due to its high accuracy and efficiency, CRISPR/Cas9 techniques may provide a great chance to treat some gene-related diseases by disrupting, inserting, correcting, replacing, or blocking genes for clinical application with gene therapy."
