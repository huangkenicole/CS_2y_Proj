        "Adenomatosis coli is recently regarded as a systemic disease with a predisposition to multiple tumor formation. We report siblings of familial adenomatosis coli with gastric cancers. Case 1 was a 58 year-old elder brother. His diagnosis was familial adenomatosis coli accompanied with colon cancer and simultaneous early gastric cancer. Total colectomy and partial gastrectomy were carried out on Mar. 13, 1984 at our hospital. Numerous polyps over the whole colon and an ulcerative tumor in the hepatic flexure were found in the resected colon. Histologically tubular adenocarcinoma were demonstrated in the ulcerative tumor, and all other polyps were adenomas. In the resected gastric specimen, there were two shallow, depressed lesions on the each anterior and posterior wall of the antrum. Histologically both of them were adenocarcinoma confined within the mucosa. Postoperative course was satisfactory and he is quite healthy 2 and a half years after surgery. Case 2 was a 56 year-old younger brother. He received a partial gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer at another hospital on May 20, 1982. In one and a half year from the surgery, a large lung tumor (probably metastasis of the gastric cancer) was found and he received chemotherapy. He also received radiation therapy in June, 1984 and during this admission barium enema study was performed. It revealed numerous polyps over the whole colon. No cancerous lesions were found. He died of lung tumor on Dec. 8, 1985. The similar siblings were first reported by Kokaji et al. in 1984, and our cases seem to be the second ones."
