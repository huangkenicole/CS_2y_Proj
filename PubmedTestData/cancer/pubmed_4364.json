        "Telomerase, undetectable in normal somatic cells, plays a critical role in carcinogenesis of the majority of human tumors including lung carcinoma. The aim of our study was to determine human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA expression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in order to estimate its usefulness as diagnostic and/or prognostic factor. hTERT expression was analyzed in a group of 12 females and 28 males with NSCLC using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR method) in cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissues. Results were analyzed according to clinical data and one-, two-, and five-year survival rates. hTERT expression in the cancerous tissue was significantly higher than in the lung parenchyma free from neoplasm infiltration (p<0.05). There was no significant association between hTERT expression in the tumor tissue and age, gender, grading or clinical stage. A significant difference in hTERT expression between two types of histopathological patterns (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) was detected (p=0.01). No association between hTERT expression in NSCLC specimens and survival rates was found. hTERT mRNA detection by QRT-PCR in tumor and corresponding cancer-free tissues can be used as a diagnostic marker in patients with NSCLC, but seems not to be a prognostic factor."
