        "Perinatal depression in women is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and has attracted increasing attention. The investigation of risk factors of perinatal depression in women may contribute to the early identification of depressed or depression-prone women in clinical practice.",
        "A computerized systematic literature search was made in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from January 2009 to October 2021. All included articles were published in English, which evaluated factors influencing perinatal depression in women. Based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration protocols, Review Manager 5.3 was used as a statistical platform.",
        "Thirty-one studies with an overall sample size of 79,043 women were included in the review. Educational level (P\u2009=\u20090.0001, odds ratio [OR]: 1.40, 95% CI: [1.18,1.67]), economic status of families (P\u2009=\u20090.0001, OR: 1.69, 95%CI: [1.29,2.22]), history of mental illness (P\u2009<\u20090.00001, OR: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.18, 0.47]), domestic violence (P\u2009<\u20090.00001, OR: 0.24, 95% CI: [0.17,0.34]), perinatal smoking or drinking (P\u2009=\u20090.005, OR: 0.63; 95% CI [0.45, 0.87]; P\u2009=\u20090.008, OR: 0.43, 95% CI, [0.23 to 0.80]; respectively), and multiparity(P\u2009=\u20090.0003, OR: 0.74, 95% CI: [0.63, 0.87]) were correlated with perinatal depression in women. The stability of our pooled results was verified by sensitivity analysis and publication bias was not observed based on funnel plot results.",
        "Lower educational level, poor economic status of families, history of mental illness, domestic violence, perinatal smoking or drinking, and multiparity serve as risk factors of perinatal depression in women."
