        "Response inhibition (RI) deficit is an aspect of cognitive impairment in depressed individuals, but currently no effective treatment has been established. This study aimed to explore the effect of individualized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC)-nucleus accumbens (NAcc) network on RI in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).",
        "Fourty-four patients diagnosed with MDD were randomized to receive 15 once-daily sessions of active (10\u00a0Hz, 100% of resting motor threshold) or sham rTMS within a double-blind, sham-controlled trial. We measured the efficacy of rTMS by the improvements in behavioral and neurological manifestations during the stop-signal task. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HAMD-17) was used to assess depressive symptoms. We analyzed the differences in RI performance between MDD patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline and assessed whether MDD patients who completed rTMS treatment had comparable RI ability to HCs.",
        "At baseline, the depressed patients showed longer stop-signal response time (SSRT), smaller P3 amplitudes, and weaker theta-band power in successful stop trials (SSTs) than HCs. The active group exhibited RI ability comparable to that of HCs after rTMS treatment, but the improvements were not significant in the sham group. The active group showed significant remission in depression symptoms post-treatment compared to the sham group, and the changes in P3 amplitudes and theta-band power during SSTs were negatively correlated with the decrease of HAMD-17 scores.",
        "The depressed patients have impaired RI and treatment with the individualized rTMS protocol may be an effective approach."
