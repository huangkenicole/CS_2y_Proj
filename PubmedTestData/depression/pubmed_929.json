        "The current study compared the quality of interpersonal relationships in individuals with major depressive disorder to individuals with dysthymia, comorbid depression, nonaffective disorders, and no psychiatric disorders.",
        "Using data from the National Comorbidity Study, a series of logistic regressions, controlling for demographic variables, were conducted to examine the strength of the association between a major depressive disorder and interpersonal dysfunction (positive and negative interactions) in contrast to other psychiatric disorders.",
        "Respondents with current major depressive disorder reported significantly fewer positive interactions and more negative interactions with their spouse or live-in partner than those with nonaffective disorders, and than those with no psychiatric disorders. There were no significant differences in quality of interpersonal relationships between respondents with major depressive disorder and those with dysthymia. Among those with major depressive disorder, comorbidity or treatment-seeking behavior did not significantly contribute to degree of interpersonal difficulties. The strength of the association between interpersonal dysfunction and depression were, in general, comparable for men and women with major depressive disorder.",
        "The cross-sectional design of this report precludes inferences regarding causality between quality of interpersonal relationship and current major depressive disorder.",
        "The results of this study indicate that, relative to psychiatric illness in general, poor intimate relationships are characteristic of a current major depressive disorder."
