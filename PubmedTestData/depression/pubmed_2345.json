        "This study aimed to investigate whether acute and chronic poststroke depression (PSD) were associated with cardio-cerebrovascular events (CVEs).",
        "A total of 423 patients with recent stroke were recruited from 2006 to 2009. They were diagnosed with major or minor depressive disorder during the acute phase (within 2\u00a0weeks) after stroke. Of these, 284 completed the same diagnostic evaluation during the chronic phase (1\u00a0year) after stroke. An average 12-year (range 8.7-14.1\u00a0years) follow-up was conducted to assess composite CVEs including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death after the index stroke. During the follow-up, Kaplan-Meier event rates for outcomes were calculated, and hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression models after adjusting for a range of covariates.",
        "The composite CVE incidence was higher in patients with acute or chronic PSD than in those without. Composite event incidence was highest in patients with PSD during both the acute and chronic phases.",
        "The presence of depression at acute and chronic phase of stroke predicted worse long-term cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes. Evaluation of PSD during both the acute and chronic phases is recommended."
