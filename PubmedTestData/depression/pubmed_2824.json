        "Maternal depression and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common form of pharmaceutical intervention, can both have an impact on infant development. As such, it is difficult for healthcare providers to recommend a course of treatment to expectant mothers suffering from depression, or to women on antidepressant medication prior to pregnancy. This review will discuss the existing research on the developmental impacts of maternal depression and its treatment with SSRIs, with a particular focus on contributing factors that complicate our attempt to disentangle the consequences of maternal depression and its treatment such as the timing or severity of the depression. We will explore avenues for translational animal models to help address the question of \"Trick or Treat\", i.e.: which is worse for offspring development: exposure to maternal depression, or the SSRI treatment? Further, we will explore sex-dependent outcomes for the offspring in human and animal studies as male and female offspring may react differently to the presence of maternal depression or antidepressant treatment. Without more clinical and preclinical data, it remains difficult for women to make an informed decision regarding their depression treatment before, during, and after their pregnancy."
