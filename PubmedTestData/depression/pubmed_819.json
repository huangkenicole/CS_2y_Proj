        "This paper aimed to synthesize empirical findings of patient extratherapeutic interpersonal variables associated with individual psychotherapy treatment outcomes in adult outpatients with depression.",
        "A systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant studies. Thematic analysis was used to identify recurring themes in the findings.",
        "Forty studies met search criteria. Three themes of patient extratherapeutic interpersonal variables were identified: capacity to engage with others, capacity to navigate relationships, and capacity to achieve intimacy, progressing from basic to advanced levels of interpersonal interaction. Interpersonal variables such as interpersonal distress and style, attachment orientation, and quality of object relations were particularly useful in predicting treatment outcomes, whereas access to social support and marital status provided mixed results, likely because they do not account for relationship quality.",
        "Recognizing variables associated with treatment response can help clinicians identify patients at risk for nonresponse and guide efforts for adapting existing therapies and developing new ones."
