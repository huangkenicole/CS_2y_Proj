        "Public beliefs about psychiatric disorders are important for understanding help-seeking behaviours. We investigated factors that affect South Koreans' beliefs about the causes and treatment of depression and bipolar disorder. We recruited 654 participants aged 15-54 years using an online panel survey. Participants completed two questionnaires: 34 possible causes of and 33 possible treatments for depression and bipolar disorder. For both disorders, the questionnaires about causes revealed four factors: social-environmental, God/fate, heath/lifestyle, and biological; the questionnaires about treatments revealed five factors: self-help/stress management, physical treatment/health management, seeking mental health services, religious help, and resting. Causes of depression were more recognized as social-environmental, religious, and health/lifestyle compared to bipolar disorder. Participants expressed more beliefs in self-help/stress management, physical treatment/health management, seeking mental health services, and resting for depression, compared to bipolar disorder. Participants' beliefs about the causes of the disorders and their demographic and psychiatric characteristics were closely associated with beliefs about treatment validity. Participants' beliefs about the causes of depression and bipolar disorder significantly affected their beliefs about treatment. Therefore, strategies to improve mental health literacy should provide the aetiology of specific mental disorders. Further research using a representative community sample is needed to generalize our findings."
