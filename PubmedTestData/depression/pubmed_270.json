        "A total of 251 elderly residents of 2 boroughs of greater Athens were examined by a psychiatrist. For the assessment of depressive symptoms, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale was used. Cognitive functioning was also evaluated. The prevalence of affective disorders of any type was estimated by a clinical examination with a semistructured psychiatric interview (PEF) supplemented by DSM-III criteria. A total of 27.1% of the elderly respondents reported a significant number of dysphoric or depressive symptoms and were identified as depressed cases. Respondents who had lower socioeconomic status, were widowed, were experiencing stressful life events or were living alone exhibited a significant degree of depressive psychopathology. An association between depressed mood and cognitive impairment was also found. A total of 9.5% of the sample was diagnosed as suffering from any type of affective disorder (1.6% major depression, 0.6% bipolar, 5.5% dysthymic disorder and 2.0% adjustment disorder with depressed mood). Affective disorders constitute nearly half of the total number of psychiatric diagnoses (20.3% at the sample). It is interesting that, of the 27.1% of the sample with depressed mood (> or = 16 score on CES-D Scale), only 9.5% of the sample were diagnosed as suffering from clinical types of depression."
