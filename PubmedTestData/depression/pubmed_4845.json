        "The effects of maternal depression on mother-infant relationship quality likely vary according to depression heterogeneity. We investigated the effects of different presentations of major depression on mother-infant emotional availability (EA).",
        "Data were obtained from 115 mother-infant dyads from a longitudinal pregnancy cohort. Disorders, symptoms, and antidepressant use were assessed in pregnancy and postpartum, and EA was observed 6-month postpartum. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5. A series of multivariate analyses of covariance analyses' examining the effects of disorder on EA were conducted.",
        "After controlling for maternal age, antidepressant use, and postpartum depressive symptoms, MDD accounted for 20% of the variance in EA. In the MDD/GAD group, 93% of interactions were rated as emotionally unavailable, nearly threefold the comparison group rate.",
        "Findings demonstrate that different presentations of major depression are associated with observed differences in mother-infant EA."
