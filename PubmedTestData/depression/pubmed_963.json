        "In this study, depression among patients visiting general practitioners was examined by administering a short self-report measure of depression to 1,250 patients visiting 37 general practitioners in three Canadian centres (Winnipeg, Brandon and Virden). According to scores on the CES-D scale, 66.8% of the patients were judged to be normal, 11.8% were experiencing mild depression, 13.3% moderate depression and 8.1% were experiencing fairly severe depression. Depression scores were highest among female patients, patients who lived in Winnipeg, patients who were unemployed and patients who were divorced or separated."
