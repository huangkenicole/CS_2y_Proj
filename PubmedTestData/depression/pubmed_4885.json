        "Sertraline is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, but its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties are still not completely characterized. Using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, we examined factors influencing sertraline PK variability in outpatients with major depressive disorder. Blood samples from 53 male and female adults treated with sertraline orally were collected at a steady state. Various demographic and clinical covariates were tested by stepwise regression procedure. We found that sertraline clearance is significantly influenced by serum concentrations of its main metabolite N-desmethylsertraline, whereas clearance of N-desmethylsertraline is affected by both creatinine clearance and drug daily dose. These results were confirmed by the reduction of points dispersion in goodness-of-fit plots for their predicted versus measured concentrations and with bootstrapping analyses. This finding can serve to inform sertraline dosing optimization, especially when changes in kidney function occur in treated individuals, to prevent adverse drug reactions and maximize therapeutic benefits."
