        "To study prevalence of depression in poststroke survivors in Phramongkutklao Hospital and factors associated with depression.",
        "From 150 stroke survivors, therefor 101 patients who met inclusion criteria. These subjects were screened with Thai Geriatric Depressive Scale (TGDS) and interviewed. Demographic data that would effect depression were evaluated.",
        "During 9 months of studying period, 101 of 150 patients diagnosed with poststroke survivors were eligible. The prevalence of depression was 46.53%. Severity of depression were mild depression 20.79%, moderate 18.81% and severe depression 6.93%. There were no statistically significant among sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and site of stroke between depression and non-depression groups. Risk factors for severe poststroke depression were younger age, duration within one year after stroke onset and history of coronary artery disease.",
