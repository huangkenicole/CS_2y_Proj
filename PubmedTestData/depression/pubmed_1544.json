        "Screening for depression in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial. There is limited data on the actual depression management need in routine care. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, treatment rates, prognosis, and management need of clinical and subclinical depression in CHD patients according to the American Heart Association recommendations and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline \"Depression in Adults with a Chronic Physical Health Problem\".",
        "Patients were recruited at 2 German university clinics between 2012 and 2014. Depressive disorders were assessed according to the DSM-IV and depressive symptom severity at baseline and during follow-up was evaluated with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Depression management need was determined by the severity and longitudinal course of depression symptoms.",
        "Of 1,024 patients (19% women), 12% had clinical depression (depressive disorder) and 45% had subclinical depression (PHQ-9 score \u22655) at baseline. Among those with clinical depression, 46% were in treatment at least once during 12 months; 26% were continuously in treatment during follow-up. Depressive disorder and depressive symptoms were significant risk factor-adjusted predictors of the 12-months mortality (adjusted HR = 3.19; 95% CI 1.32-7.69, and adjusted HR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.16, respectively). Depressive symptoms persisted in 85% of the clinically depressed and in 47% of the subclinically depressed patients. According to current recommendations, 29% of all CHD patients would require depression management within 1 year.",
        "There is a need for enhanced recognition, referral, and continuous and improved clinical management of depression in CHD patients."
