        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-encoding, single-stranded RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length encoded by endogenous genes involved in posttranscriptional gene expression regulation. Studies have shown that miRNAs participate in a series of important pathophysiological processes, including the pathogenesis of depression. This article systematically summarized the research results published in the field of miRNAs and depression, which mainly involved three topics: circulating miRNAs as markers for diagnosis and prognosis of depression, the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of depression, and the roles of miRNAs in the mechanisms of depression treatment. By summarizing and analyzing the research literature in recent years, we found that some circulating miRNAs can be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of depression. miRNAs that disorderly expressed during the disease play important roles in the depression pathogenesis, and miRNAs also play roles in the mechanisms of psychotherapy and drug therapy for depression. Elucidating the important roles of miRNAs in depression will bring people's understanding of the pathogenesis of depression to a new level. In addition, these miRNAs may be developed as new biomarkers for diagnosing depression, or as drug targets, or these molecules may be used as new drugs, which may provide new means for the treatment of depression. KEY MESSAGES: \u2022 The research results of miRNAs and depression are reviewed. \u2022 Circulating miRNAs can be potential biomarkers for depression. \u2022 MiRNAs play important roles in the depression pathogenesis. \u2022 MiRNAs play important roles in drug therapy for depression."
