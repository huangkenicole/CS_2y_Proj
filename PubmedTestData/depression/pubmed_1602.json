        "There are significant unmet needs for psychological interventions for anxiety and depression in the population. e-health resources complement existing services by providing high quality information, symptom prevention, management interventions and peer support.",
        "This article discusses e-health anxiety and depression resources offered by Australian providers and the ways in which general practitioners can assist their patients in accessing the diverse range of available resources.",
        "After appropriate diagnostic assessment, and as an adjunct to treatment according to best evidence based practice, GPs may consider referring patients to online information, support and assessment sites and/or prevention or treatment programs. People experiencing anxiety and depression are particularly likely to seek information online and may also value peer support online. There is now good evidence that symptom prevention and management programs can be effective in adults. Evaluation of programs for children and adolescents has also been encouraging. Current and future research will clarify the role of delivery factors such as therapist support that may influence effectiveness in clinical settings."
