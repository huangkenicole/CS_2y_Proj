        "The stress response comprises a phylogenetically conserved set of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral responses that evolved as a survival strategy. In this context, the memory of stressful events would be adaptive as it could avoid re-exposure to an adverse event, otherwise the event would be facilitated in positively stressful or non-distressful conditions. However, the interaction between stress and memory comprises complex responses, some of them which are not yet completely understood, and which depend on several factors such as the memory system that is recruited, the nature and duration of the stressful event, as well as the timing in which this interaction takes place. In this narrative review, we briefly discuss the mechanisms of the stress response, the main memory systems, and its neural correlates. Then, we show how stress, through the action of its biochemical mediators, influences memory systems and mnemonic processes. Finally, we make use of major depressive disorder to explore the possible implications of non-adaptive interactions between stress and memory to psychiatric disorders, as well as possible roles for memory studies in the field of psychiatry."
