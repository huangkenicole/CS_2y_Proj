        "This article provides a critical review of what is currently known concerning the nature and scope of depression in persons who have MS. It begins with a discussion of relevant terminology,which is followed by a summary of the research literature concern-ing the prevalence; severity; and risk factors for, and impact of, depression in MS. Assessment issues also are reviewed. Gaps in the literature on the treatment of depression in persons who have MS also are discussed. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions that will improve our understanding of depression, its treatment, and the other side-resilience in the face of a serious neurologic condition."
