        "Dysregulation is a combination of emotion, behavior, and attention problems associated with lifelong psychiatric comorbidity. There is evidence for the stability of dysregulation from childhood to adulthood, which would be more fully characterized by determining the likely stability from infancy to childhood. Early origins of dysregulation can further be validated and contextualized in association with environmental and biological factors, such as prenatal stress and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for overlapping child psychiatric problems. We aimed to determine trajectories of dysregulation from 3\u00a0months to 5\u00a0years (N\u00a0=\u00a0582) in association with maternal prenatal depression moderated by multiple child PRS (N\u00a0=\u00a0232 pairs with available PRS data) in a prenatal cohort. Mothers reported depression symptoms at 24-26\u00a0weeks' gestation and child dysregulation at 3, 6, 18, 36, 48, and 60\u00a0months. The PRS were for major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross disorder, and childhood psychiatric problems. Covariates were biological sex, maternal education, and postnatal depression. Analyses included latent classes and regression. Two dysregulation trajectories emerged: persistently low dysregulation (94%), and increasingly high dysregulation (6%). Stable dysregulation emerged at 18\u00a0months. High dysregulation was associated with maternal prenatal depression, moderated by PRS for child comorbid psychiatric problems. Males were at greater risk of high dysregulation."
