      "AbstractText": [
        "Case conceptualization is assumed to be an important element in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) because it describes and explains clients' presentations in ways that inform intervention. However, we do not have a good measure of competence in CBT case conceptualization that can be used to guide training and elucidate mechanisms.",
        "The current study addresses this gap by describing the development and preliminary psychometric properties of the Collaborative Case Conceptualization - Rating Scale (CCC-RS; Padesky et al., 2011). The CCC-RS was developed in accordance with the model posited by Kuyken et al. (2009).",
        "Data for this study (N = 40) were derived from a larger trial (Wiles et al., 2013) with adults suffering from resistant depression. Internal consistency and inter-rater reliability were calculated. Further, and as a partial test of the scale's validity, Pearson's correlation coefficients were obtained for scores on the CCC-RS and key scales from the Cognitive Therapy Scale - Revised (CTS-R; Blackburn et al., 2001).",
        "The CCC-RS showed excellent internal consistency (\u03b1 = .94), split-half (.82) and inter-rater reliabilities (ICC =.84). Total scores on the CCC-RS were significantly correlated with scores on the CTS-R (r = .54, p < .01). Moreover, the Collaboration subscale of the CCC-RS was significantly correlated (r = .44) with its counterpart of the CTS-R in a theoretically predictable manner.",
        "These preliminary results indicate that the CCC-RS is a reliable measure with adequate face, content and convergent validity. Further research is needed to replicate and extend the current findings to other facets of validity."
