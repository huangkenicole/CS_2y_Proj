        "The study examines the relationship of negative emotions with: 1) non-emotional symptoms (e.g., vegetative and physical symptoms) and 2) the course of depression in suicidal older adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and cognitive impairment treated with psychotherapy.",
        "The authors identified a subgroup of participants (N\u202f=\u202f26) who expressed suicidal ideation at Baseline or Week 12 from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of two psychosocial interventions, Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH) and Supportive Therapy for Cognitively Impaired. The authors assessed negative emotions, non-emotional symptoms of depression, depression severity, and suicidal ideation at entry, week 4, week 8, and week 12.",
        "Participants were 65 years and older and had a diagnosis of unipolar depression, varying degrees of cognitive impairment (up to moderate dementia) and suicidal ideation.",
        "The study was conducted in the Outpatient Department of New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine in Westchester, NY.",
        "Negative emotions and non-emotional items were identified with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D).",
        "Among participants with suicidal ideation, the reduction in negative emotions from baseline to week 4, week 4 to week 8, and week 8 to week 12 was significantly associated with the reduction in non-emotional symptoms of depression at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (F<sub>(1, 35)</sub>\u202f=\u202f6.20, p\u202f=\u202f0.02) and with the reduction in overall depression severity at weeks 4, 8, and 12 (F<sub>(1, 35)</sub>\u202f=\u202f26.63, p <0.0001) after controlling for depression severity at baseline (HAM-D total score) and time trends.",
        "Our findings may guide the treatment of older patients with depression and suicidal ideation to help reduce depression and suicide risk."
