      "AbstractText": [
        "Psychotherapy of depressive conditions is more and more in demand by patients. The effect of individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on depression is well-documented, and foreign studies indicate that group CBT also works well. There was no Danish manual on group CBT for the purpose of clinical implementation. The aim of the present project was to develop such a manual and complete a preliminary evaluation of the outcome.",
        "A therapy manual consisting of 12 group sessions of 2 hours duration was developed. A constituent part of the evaluation of the clinical effect was 10 group courses with a total of 51 consecutively referred patients with a non-psychotic depression requiring treatment.",
        "On the basis of clinical experience, the manual has been revised and is now ready for publication. 80% of the patients completed the therapy course with a large Effect Size (ES) on psychiatric/depression symptoms (SCL-90R) and function level (GAF), as well as moderate ES on the degree of hopelessness (BHS).",
        "The development and clinical implementation of a manual in cognitive behavioral group therapy has resulted in this treatment now being offered as permanent treatment for depressive patients throughout the cooperating centers. The existing manual can relatively easily be implemented in other treatment centers and clinics. The preliminary results are positive, but the design does not permit further conclusions."
