        "In recent years, special attention in genetic studies dedicated to the development of various diseases, including mental disorders, has been paid to micro ribonucleic acids (miRNA, microRNA). As an object of our analysis we have selected the miRNAs which - due to the profile of their activity - may be significant in the aetiology and course of recurrent depressive disorders, i.e. miRNA-370, miRNA-411, miRNA-433, miRNA-487b and miRNA-539.",
        "The examined population included 138 patients suffering from depression and 95 individuals from the control group (CG). The subjects suffering from depression were divided into two sub-groups: ED-I group (46 patients), rDD group (92 patients).",
        "No significant statistical differences were observed between the ED-I and rDD group for all the variables included in the analysis. No significant interrelation was noticed between the number of depression episodes, the severity of depressive disorders and the expression of miRNA selected. Results of the analysis indicate statistically significant differences between the control subjects and the patients with symptoms of depression in terms of all the variables analysed.",
        "1. There is no significant difference in miRNAs expression between patients with recurrent depressive disorders and those in the first episode of depression. 2. The differences in terms of expression of the analysed variables between the subjects with symptoms of depression and healthy individuals were confirmed."
