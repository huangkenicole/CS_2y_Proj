        "To determine whether distinctive prolonged-grief-disorder- (PGD) and depressive-symptom states emerge among family caregivers of cancer patients over their first 2\u00a0years of bereavement. This may extend cross-sectional evidence that PGD and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms can co-occur/occur independently and validate their construct distinctiveness.",
        "In this secondary-analysis study, PGD symptoms and depressive symptoms were measured over 666 caregivers using 11 grief symptom items of the Prolonged Grief-13 scale and 16 items of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, respectively. Distinct PGD/depressive-symptom states were identified by latent transition analysis with dichotomous indicators (presence/absence) of PGD or depressive symptoms.",
        "Four distinct PGD/depressive-symptom states emerged. The resilient and subthreshold depression-dominant states showed low and moderate probabilities of the presence of majority of depressive symptoms, respectively, with no PGD symptoms having a greater than moderate probability of presence. The depression-dominant state was marked by a high probability of the presence for 9 of 16 depressive symptoms, with moderate probabilities for almost all PGD symptoms. The PGD-depression comorbid state was characterized by a high probability of presence of all PGD symptoms and depressive symptoms, except for moderate probabilities of presence of two depressive symptoms.",
        "Our longitudinal identification of a predominantly depressive state but absence of a PGD-dominant state provides further evidence that PGD and MDD are related but distinct constructs that can occur independently or concurrently as the PGD-depression comorbid state. When PGD is suspected, bereaved individuals should be assessed for the potential comorbidity of MDD."
