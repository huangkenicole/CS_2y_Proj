        "The effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder varies considerably between patients. With these interindividual differences and a number of antidepressants to choose from, the first choice of treatment often fails to produce improvement in the patient's condition. A substantial part of the variation in response to antidepressants can be explained by genetic factors. Accordingly, variants related to drug metabolism in two pharmacogenes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, have already been translated into guidelines for antidepressant prescriptions. The role of variants in other genes that influence antidepressant responses is not yet understood. Furthermore, rare and individual variants account for a substantial part of genetic differences in antidepressant efficacy. Recent years have brought a tremendous increase in the accessibility of genome sequencing in terms of data availability and its clinical use. In this review, we summarize recent developments and current issues in the personalization of major depressive disorder treatment through pharmacogenomics.
