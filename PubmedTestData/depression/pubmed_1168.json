        "The aim of the study was to detect the prevalence of depressive syndromes and symptoms in the sample of elderly persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and to analyse Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating (MADRS) item scores.",
        "The subjects of the study were 102 consecutive out-patients with MCI. All subjects were assessed by an experienced psychiatrist and MADRS was applied. Major and minor depressive episodes were defined according to DSM-IV criteria. Factor analysis was used to analyse baseline MADRS item scores.",
        "Three patient groups emerged according to the depressive symptoms distribution and severity scores basis: those with major depression constituted 19.6% (n = 20), with minor depression 26.5% (n = 27), and with very few depressive symptoms 53.9% (n = 55). Three interpretable MADRS factors were identified, using the factor analysis with Varimax rotation: the first consisting of apparent and reported sadness, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, the second consisting of inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, suicidal thoughts, and the third with concentration difficulties and lassitude.",
        "It was concluded that both major and minor depression is common in MCI. Three MADRS factors were identified and labelled as anhedonia-pessimism, anxiety-vegetative, and cognitive-inhibition."
