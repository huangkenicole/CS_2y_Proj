        "BACKGROUND There have been few studies published on the prevalence of severe depressive episode in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or its role in adherence to dietary recommendations. We examined the Polish National Health Fund (NFZ) database estimates of all medical visits from 2010 to 2017 to determine the trend and the epidemiology of severe depressive episode in T2DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS The NFZ database was used. We defined the T2DM group diagnosed with both T2DM and severe depressive episode according to the ICD-10 codes. The annual prevalence of severe depressive episode was estimated according to the T2DM diagnosis status, and the age groups were stratified into 8 groups. RESULTS Relative risk for depression (regardless of severity of symptoms) in T2DM is 1.347 [95%CI: 1.342-1.353]. The frequency trend of severe depressive episode with or without psychotic symptoms remains relatively stable. In the case of mild and moderate depressive episode, a downward trend was noted, but they are still the most frequent mood disorders diagnosed. Patients with T2DM aged 20 to 40, for whom the peak of coexistence of these illnesses was noted, are the group particularly vulnerable to depression. Depression also remains on a relatively high but stable level for patients over 60 years of age. CONCLUSIONS The coexistence of depressive episodes in T2DM is a key challenge for medicine and public health. Measures aimed at early identification of patients with T2DM prone to depression need to be taken. Creating multidisciplinary care teams in diabetes management is also necessary."
