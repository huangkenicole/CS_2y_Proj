        "The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and depression. We also analysed the effect of levothyroxine (L-T4) on depression in SCH patients. We found an insignificant difference for the composite endpoint: standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03, 0.48, P\u2009=\u20090.08, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200973.6%). The odds ratio (OR) for depressive patients was 1.75 (95% CI 0.97, 3.17 P\u2009=\u20090.064, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200964.6%). Furthermore, sub-group analysis according to age found that SCH was related to depression in younger patients (<60 years old), as defined by the diagnosis of depression: OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.02, 14.18, P\u2009=\u20090.047, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.0%) or an increase on the depressive scale: SMD of 0.42 (95% CI 0.03, 0.82, P\u2009=\u20090.036, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200966.6%). Meanwhile, SCH did not associate with depression in older patients (\u226560 years old), as defined by the diagnosis of depression: OR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.81, 2.90, P\u2009=\u20090.193, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200971.3%) or an increase on the depressive scale: SMD of 0.03 (95%CI -0.31, 0.37, P\u2009=\u20090.857, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200979.8%). We also found an insignificant difference in the composite endpoint between the L-T4 supplementation group and placebo group in SCH patients. The estimated SMD was 0.26 (95% CI -0.09, 0.62, P\u2009=\u20090.143, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200952.9%). This meta-analysis demonstrates that SCH is not connected to depression. However, sub-group analysis according to age found that SCH is related to depression in younger patients, but not in older patients. Furthermore, we failed to find an effect of L-T4 supplementation treatment for SCH on depression."
