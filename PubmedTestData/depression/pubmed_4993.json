        "The purpose of the study was to examine the role of diabetes and diabetes-related distress within clinician-administered depression interviews of adults with type 1 diabetes.",
        "This mixed-methods study coded responses to a structured clinical interview of depressive symptom severity administered to adults with type 1 diabetes (n = 34; 65% female; 56% white, 38% African American, 27% Hispanic). Pearson correlations and t tests assessed relationships between interview-based and self-reported ratings of diabetes-related distress and depression.",
        "Among participants endorsing depressive symptoms in the interview, 73% mentioned diabetes as a contributing factor. Themes emerged relating to (1) a link between diabetes symptoms and distress, including problems with appetite, sleep, concentration, and social relationships; (2) overlapping symptoms between diabetes and depression; and (3) the perceived interconnectedness of mood and blood glucose levels. Clinician-assessed depression ratings were strongly associated with self-reported ratings of depression and self-reported diabetes-related distress. Interview-based diabetes-related distress was significantly associated with self-reported diabetes-related distress. Those with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (44%) reported more diabetes-related distress.",
        "Results suggest that diabetes may influence the evaluation of depression, even in standardized clinical interviews administered by trained professionals, the gold standard of assessment. Findings highlight a need for improved conceptualization and measurement of distress in individuals with diabetes to distinguish between symptoms caused by illness burden and those indicating a psychiatric disorder."
