        "The recognition or detection of depressive symptoms and syndromes in patients with cancer is of value to the patient because his mental distress may respond to treatment, and to the clinician because some of the clinical complications or difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of the patient may be reduced. Many factors militate against the diagnosis of depressive syndromes in patients with cancer. These include problems with the application of standard sets of criteria for depression, the assumption on the part of medical staff, family, and patients that depression is a \"natural\" response and therefore not treatable, and the pressure on all involved to \"think positive.\" Some ways of modifying the usual screening and diagnostic procedures for depressive disorders are suggested."
