        "To evaluate in a pilot study whether peer counseling is feasible and accepted for inpatients with depression. A one-to-one peer counseling intervention was implemented in an inpatient psychiatric department. Patients were invited to ask questions concerning their illness. Three trained counselors with a history of depressive episodes supervised peers. The patients evaluated the counseling and their mood. The peer counselors evaluated the counseling; in addition their depression stigma was assessed. Twenty-nine patients (F32 or F33 according to ICD-10, mean age 43 years, 58% female, hospitalized for three weeks minimum) participated. Main topics addressed were 'the patient himself' and 'treatment options, offers and services in the local area'. 94% would recommend peer counseling, 72% would like to take part again. Self-rated mood was significantly higher after than before the counseling. The findings suggest that peer counseling is a useful, additional offer for inpatients with depression as it appears to meet needs yet not addressed. Patients especially valued the counselor's personal experiences. Routine care of depression can be enhanced with peer counseling, e.g. by smoothing the transition from inpatient to outpatient treatment. Further, RCTs on peer counseling in depression should be conducted prospectively."
