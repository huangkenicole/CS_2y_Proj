        "Behavioural activation and physical activity have received empirical support that highlight their efficacy in reducing depression. Even though both behavioural activation and physical activity share the common goal of reactivating the individual, limited research has directly compared these interventions, and more research is required to evaluate their efficacy when offered in low-intensity formats. The present study involves a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of two guided self-help interventions for the treatment of depression: behavioural activation and physical activity. Fifty-nine participants presenting mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression were randomized either to a behavioural activation intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a020), a physical activity intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a019) or a wait-list control group (n\u00a0=\u00a020). All participants completed symptom measure pre-, mid- and post-intervention, as well as at a two-month follow-up. Mixed-model analyses of variance revealed that both interventions were significantly more efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms in comparison with the control group. Physical activity involved significantly less time-investment compared to the behavioural activation condition (less than half the amount of time). These results indicate that physical activity and behavioural activation both effectively reduce depressive symptoms and are favourably applicable in low-intensity formats. Implications of these results and avenues for future research are discussed."
