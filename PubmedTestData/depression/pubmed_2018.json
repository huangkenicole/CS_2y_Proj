        "Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is ubiquitous in popular culture and has influenced psychiatric diagnosis with the inclusion of the seasonal pattern modifier for the Major Depressive Episode in DSM. However, recent research has not supported the association of Major Depressive Episode with seasonal changes. The present study was conducted to determine if a seasonally-related pattern of occurrence of mild variants of depression could be demonstrated in a population-based study.",
        "This is a cross-sectional U.S. survey of adults who completed the PHQ-8 Depression Scale with mild depression defined using a PHQ-8 cut score and a second model based on the DSM-5 diagnosis, Depression with insufficient symptoms. Regression models were used to determine if either variant of mild depression was related to season, latitude, or measures of daylight hours.",
        "Neither measure of mild depression was related to daylight hours or its proxy measures.",
        "Screening instruments for depression, even if consistent with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, do not allow a formal diagnosis of depression or the exclusion of similar-appearing disorders. Current depression symptoms but not duration of depressive episode is measured.",
        "Mild depression is not related to seasonal changes or proxy measures of light exposure. The findings cast doubt on light deficiency as a causal factor of depressive disorders, which underpins the inclusion of the seasonal pattern modifier in DSM-5 and light supplementation as a treatment modality."
