        "Nonpharmacological antidepressant treatments are effective and well tolerated in selected patients. However, response is heterogeneous and validated biomarkers would be precious to aid treatment choice. We searched Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar until May 2022 for original articles evaluating the association of genetic variables with the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments for major depressive episodes. Most studies analyzed small sample sizes using the candidate gene approach, leading to poorly replicated findings that need to be interpreted cautiously. The few available methylome-wide and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) considered only electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy in small samples, providing interesting findings by using polygenic risk scores. A deeper knowledge of the genetic factors implicated in treatment response may lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of nonpharmacological therapies for depression, and depression itself. Future GWAS are going to expand their sample size, thanks to consortia such as the gen-ECT-ic consortium."
