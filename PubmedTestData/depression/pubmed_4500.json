        "The etiology of depressive symptoms associated with the transition to menopause is still unknown; hormonal changes, serotonergic system or insomnia, could be a trigger to depressive symptomatology. The aim of the present study was to evaluate gonadal hormonal levels, platelet serotonin concentrations and platelet tryptophan concentrations in a group of depressed perimenopausal women and their healthy counterparts.",
        "A total of 63 perimenopausal women between 45 and 55 years old were evaluated; of these, 44 were depressed patients, and 19 were perimenopausal women without depression. The instruments that were applied included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Green Climacteric Scale (GCS); gonadal hormone levels and platelet tryptophan and serotonin concentrations were measured in all participants. Differences in hormonal levels and tryptophan and serotonin concentrations were evaluated with respect to specific symptoms, such as insomnia, hot flashes, nervousness, depressed mood and loss of interest.",
        "No differences between groups were observed with respect to hormonal levels and tryptophan and serotonin concentrations; mean sleep hours and insomnia were significantly correlated with platelet tryptophan concentrations.",
        "In this sample, all symptoms of depression could not be explained by platelet tryptophan and serotonin concentrations and hormonal levels; differences were observed only when we evaluated insomnia and hot flashes."
