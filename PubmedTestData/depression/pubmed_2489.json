        "Several long-term follow-up studies investigate the progression of adolescent onset major depressive disorder but much less explore short and long-term consequences and prognosis into adulthood of childhood- onset depression. The aim of the present study is to follow childhood-onset depression, lifetime comorbid psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior into adulthood.",
        "Subjects (N=166) were 25.95+2.42 years old on average, 54.2% were women. Follow-up period lasted for a mean of 14.74+1.31 years. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed by a DSM-IV based semi-structured interview. Subjects reported on 4 stages of suicidal behavior as one of the symptoms of depressive disorder.",
        "The onset of the first depressive episode was at the mean age of 10.17+2.34 years. 40,4% of the sample had only 1 episode while recurrent depressive episode presented in 32.5% above 18 years of age. Lifetime comorbid psychiatric disorders were present in more than 1/3 of the sample. The most frequent lifetime comorbidity was anxiety (42.4%), and specific phobia among anxiety disorders. Lifetime attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and oppositional/conduct disorder were also frequent (25.9% and 16.9%, respectively). Suicidal behavior was not present life-time in 19.1% of the sample. Thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide were quite frequent (80.8% and 69.5%, respectively), specific plans and suicidal attempt were more frequent in girls (plan:female vs male 53.9% vs 38.4%, attempt: 33.3% vs 9.6%) during follow-up.",
        "About one-third of childhood-onset depression had recurrence above 18 years of age, which is lower than the recurrence rate for adolescent onset depression. A high rate of lifetime comorbidity was found between depression and anxiety disorders. The assessment of the actual level of suicidal behavior is important in the prevention of selfdestructive behavior."
