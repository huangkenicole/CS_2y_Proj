        "The comorbidity between substance use disorder and major depressive disorder is a typical dual diagnosis in the field of substance addiction. However, the prevalence and correlates of depression in methamphetamine addicts and whether it is associated with drug craving and alexithymia have been rarely reported in the Chinese population.",
        "We recruited 585 methamphetamine-dependent males from a drug rehabilitation center in China and 203 healthy controls. Demographic and drug use data were collected. Depression was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N\u00b7I.). Methamphetamine cravings and alexithymia were assessed using the Desire for Drugs Questionnaire (DDQ) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS).",
        "The prevalence rate of depression in methamphetamine-dependent men was 16.58\u00a0% (97/585). The scores of DDQ desire and intention, DDQ negative reinforcement, total DDQ, difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and total TAS score of depressed patients were higher than those of non-depressed patients. However, only DDQ negative reinforcement score, DIF, DDF, and total TAS score remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Additionally, logistic regression analysis found that age, DIF score, and DDQ negative reinforcement score were significant factors contributing to depression in methamphetamine-dependent men.",
        "Our findings suggest that the prevalence of depression is significantly higher in methamphetamine-dependent men than in the healthy Chinese population. Furthermore, age, components of alexithymia and drug craving are risk factors for depression in methamphetamine addicts."
