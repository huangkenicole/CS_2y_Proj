        "Common methodologies for treating depressive symptoms have demonstrated decreased efficacy among individuals with impaired cognitive functioning. While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been approved to treat major depressive disorder, few studies have analyzed the ability of TMS to treat depressive symptoms among individuals with cognitive impairments. The present study had two objectives: to determine whether low-frequency TMS (LF-TMS) might demonstrate efficacy in treating depressive symptoms among individuals with impaired cognitive functioning; and to determine whether LF-TMS might improve neurocognitive functioning above and beyond depressive symptom improvements.",
        "Data were derived from a pre-existing database at Eastern Virginia Medical School. Fifty-three (N=53) participants completed LF-TMS treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and CNS Vital Signs (CNS-VS) neurocognitive assessment were administered at multiple time points throughout treatment. Participants were classified as impaired cognitive functioning or average cognitive functioning based on baseline CNS-VS scores. Data were analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) measures-within-persons longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) with time-varying covariates.",
        "LF-TMS produced significant reductions in depressive symptoms for individuals in both cognitive functioning groups; however, a significant group-by-time interaction indicates differential effects between these two groups. Low-frequency TMS produced significant improvements in three neurocognitive domains above and beyond improvements in depressive symptoms; however, the reliability of these changes may be questionable.",
        "This study adds to the growing body of empirical findings for LF-TMS treatment in improving neurocognitive functioning above and beyond other treatment-related effects."
