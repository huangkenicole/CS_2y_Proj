      "AbstractText": [
        "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To identify and summarize data that describe the impact of effectively treating major depressive disorder (MDD) on the severity or risk of serious comorbidities. <b><i>Data Sources:</i></b> MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and several congresses were searched. Searches included terms related to MDD, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and physical comorbidities and were restricted to English-language publications. Searches were conducted in November 2019 for the previous 2 years for conference proceedings; no date restriction was applied to the database searches. <b><i>Study Selection:</i></b> Included studies were RCTs or meta-analyses that assessed depression therapies. Studies were required to report a statistically significant improvement in depression scores as well as the concurrent impact on comorbidities. A total of 1,997 articles were initially identified for screening. <b><i>Data Extraction</i></b>: Two investigators extracted data and assessed study quality. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 30 studies, including 24 RCTs (N\u2009=\u20096,333) and 6 meta/pooled analyses of RCTs, were included. Findings in several comorbidity categories were mixed; for example, in half (4 of 8) of the identified studies in people with cardiovascular disease and depression, individuals who received treatment leading to reduced depressive symptoms compared with a control arm also had a significantly decreased incidence of cardiovascular events or significantly improved cardiac disease symptom/severity scores compared with controls. Significant improvements in comorbid disease severity observed alongside improvements in depressive symptoms were also noted in studies of comorbid Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and fibromyalgia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Effective treatment of MDD may lead to a reduction in the severity of certain serious comorbidities. These results highlight the importance of appropriate and timely treatment of MDD."
