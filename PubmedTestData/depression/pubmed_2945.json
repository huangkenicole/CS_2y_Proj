      "AbstractText": [
        "Previous research has shown that ketamine can improve social functions. In addition, evidence also suggests that ketamine can alleviate pain. Herein, we propose that ketamine-induced improvements in pain and depression are partially mediated by a reduction in pain. We aimed to determine whether improvements in pain-mediated changes in psychological function were associated with ketamine treatment.",
        "This trial included unipolar or bipolar patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0103) who received 6 intravenous infusions (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) of ketamine over 2\u00a0weeks. The severity of current depressive symptoms and social function were evaluated by the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Scale (MADRS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Global Assessment Function (GAF), respectively, at baseline and on day 13 and day 26. At the same time points, the three dimensions of pain, including the sensory index, affective index and present pain intensity (PPI), were measured by the Simple McGill Pain Scale (SF-MPQ).",
        "The mixed model results showed that ketamine plays an important role in improving the psychosocial functioning of patients. There was a significant decrease from baseline to the day 13 and day 26, indicating that the pain index of the patient improved significantly. Mediation analysis showed that for SDS score (coef\u00a0=\u00a0-5.171, 95\u00a0% CI[-6.317, -4.025]) and GAF score (coef\u00a0=\u00a01.021, 95\u00a0% CI[0.848, 1.194]), the overall effect of ketamine was observable. The overall indirect and direct effects of ketamine on social functioning were significant (SDS: direct: coef\u00a0=\u00a0-1949 to -2114; total indirect: from 0.594 to 0.664; GAF: from 0.399 to 0.427; total indirect: coef\u00a0=\u00a00.593 to 0.664). The MADRS total score and emotional index were important mediators of the association between ketamine treatment and improvements in subjective and objective social functioning.",
