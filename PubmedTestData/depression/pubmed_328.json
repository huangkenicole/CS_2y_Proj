        "This study examined the specificity of vegetative and psychological symptoms of depression among 66 patients with acute traumatic brain injury followed over 1 year. The median frequencies of vegetative and psychological symptoms among patients with depressed mood were 3 and 3. These frequencies were three times the respective rates among nondepressed patients. Although change in self-attitude and subjective anergia distinguished depressed from nondepressed patients throughout the 1-year follow-up, some symptoms, such as early awakening and difficulty concentrating, distinguished groups only after 6 months. If diagnostic criteria for major depression were modified to include only specific symptoms of depression, the standard (i.e., unmodified) DSM-III-R still had a 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity at the initial evaluation and 80% and 100%, respectively, at 1 year. There were almost no patients with depressive symptoms without a depressed mood (i.e., \"masked\" depressions). These findings suggest that DSM-III-R criteria for major depression are useful, even in an acute head-injured population, but also suggest that the nature of posttraumatic brain injury depressive disorder may change over time."
