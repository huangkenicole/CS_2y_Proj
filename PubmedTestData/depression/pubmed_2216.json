        "Given the importance of assessing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in adolescents with eating disorders (EDs), the aim was to provide normative data on the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) for female adolescents presenting for treatment of an ED.",
        "The data source was the Helping to Outline Paediatric Eating Disorders (HOPE) Project registry (N\u2009=\u20091000), a prospective, ongoing registry study comprising consecutive pediatric tertiary ED referrals. Females (N\u2009=\u2009256; 12-17 years) with DSM-5 EDs completed the CDI at intake.",
        "Results on the CDI revealed a pattern of increasing depressive scores with age and higher scores among patients with anorexic spectrum disorders. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was high and had the same pattern as CDI scores. The mean score on the CDI in the sample was higher than community samples and clinical samples of adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and other clinical disorders.",
        "Females adolescents with EDs are at high-risk of depression and suicidal ideation. These data provide information about variation in CDI scores to guide clinicians in interpretation of scores."
