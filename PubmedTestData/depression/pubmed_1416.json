        "Treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) can include a variety of biopsychosocial approaches. In medical practice, antidepressant drugs are the most common treatment for moderate to severe depressive episodes; however, their efficacy is limited. Many depressed patients are considered treatment-resistant, with 33% failing to achieve remission after \u2265 3 treatment trials. A systemic review and meta-analysis revealed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be reasonably considered for patients with MDD and \u2265 2 prior failures of antidepressant treatment. No rTMS devices have been approved by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, which has resulted in its off-label use; therefore, to offer better care for cases of treatment-resistant MDD, we should continue efforts to seek the introduction of rTMS to Japan."
