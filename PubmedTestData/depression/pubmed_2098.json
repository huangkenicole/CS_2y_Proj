        "The aim of the present study was to develop a quantitative rating scale for depression based on observations in the ward and one that can be administered by the nursing staff.",
        "Based on a literature survey and existing depression rating scales, a new rating scale was developed especially suited for use in inpatient care. The patients were rated simultaneously with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Estimation of construct validity, criterion validity, and item bias was performed with Rasch analysis and analysis of correlation.",
        "Statistical analysis revealed that the scale consisted of two sub-scales for mood and behaviour. One item had to be omitted as it was not homogeneous with either of the two sub-scales.",
        "The present depression rating scales rely on ward observations of patients during admission. This might be the reason why the items concerning behaviour are so strongly represented in this scale. Good correlations were found between the different scales, except for the score on BDI and the sub-scale concerning behaviour. This may be explained by the fact that the BDI is the patient's own judgement of cognitive function and mood. The observations in the ward are to a greater extent built on observation of patient behaviour. It can be used routinely on the psychiatric ward."
