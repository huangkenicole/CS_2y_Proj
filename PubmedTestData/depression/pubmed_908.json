        "Depressive and anxiety disorders are common problems facing obstetrician-gynecologists. Although psychiatric disorders are equally common in men and women, women are at least twice as likely to present with depressive disorders and most anxiety disorders. The depressive disorders include major depression, dysthymia, seasonal affective disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The anxiety disorders are panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and PTSD. One must diagnose and manage depressive and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the purpureum, and while breastfeeding. General treatment principles include assessing suicide risk, psychotherapy, pharmacologic treatment, and an appropriate medical work-up for depressive and anxiety disorders. The SSRIs are the first-line treatment for most depressive and anxiety disorders because of data supporting their efficacy, the minimal need for dosage titration, the overall favorable side-effect profile, and the length of available clinical experience. Newer antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine, are options for patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, the SSRIs. Treatment considerations include acute, maintenance, and continuation therapy, dosage regimens, adverse effects, and drug interactions. Specific guidelines are available for referring patients to a mental health specialist."
