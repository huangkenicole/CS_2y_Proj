        "The novel 2019 SARS-2-CoV causing COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the entire world. COVID-19 is a broad-based stressor, and research to date has documented increases in mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and substance use, since the onset of COVID-19. By taking a transdiagnostic approach, scholars can help elucidate mechanisms and vulnerability as well as resiliency related to behavioral health problems in the context of COVID-19. The aim of the current special issue of <i>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</i> was to showcase ongoing research focused on transdiagnostic factors in the context of COVID-19. The purpose of this issue is to highlight the significance of this work in the pandemic for research and practice; illustrate some of the many domains currently being explored via innovative approaches; and explicate fruitful areas for programmatic study. We hope that readers will recognize the important role of transdiagnostic models and their potential to offset the mental, addictive, and physical health disease burden of COVID-19."
