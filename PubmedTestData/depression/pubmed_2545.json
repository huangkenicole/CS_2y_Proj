        "Depression is a psychiatric disorder with global public health concerns. Although a number of risk factors have been identified for depression, there is no clear relationship between biochemistry and depression. In this study, we assessed whether depressive disorders are significantly associated with biochemical indicators.",
        "Our study included 17,561 adults (age\u2009\u2265\u200918\u2009years) participating in the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The relationship between depression and biochemical and obesity indicators was analyzed by logistic regression.",
        "As compared to the control group, men with depression showed significantly higher levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, and triglycerides, and lower levels of albumin and total bilirubin. The depressed group had higher levels of alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, and sodium than the control group.",
        "Several biochemical and anthropometric indices were associated with depression in this study. It would be interesting to further analyze their cause-effect relationship.",
        "This study is a cross-sectional study. The population is less restricted and does not exclude people with diabetes, pregnancy, etc., so it is less significant for a specific population. Dietary information was not included, as diet plays an important role in many indicators."
