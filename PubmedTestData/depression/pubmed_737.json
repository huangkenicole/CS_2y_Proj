        "The primary aim was to examine the associations of hypothesized maternal and paternal risk factors with course of depression diagnosis in a community sample from ages 15-20. In addition, we describe longitudinal stability and change in depression diagnosis over this period. In the Youth and Mental Health study 242 adolescents completed questionnaires and the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime interview at ages 15 and 20, and risk factors were measured by parent report including the Adult Self Report. Both groups who remained depressed and who recovered were more likely to have mothers with internalizing problems. Paternal internalizing problems was also significantly associated with course of depression. These findings suggest treatment of depression in adolescents and young adults may benefit from consideration of the parents' internalizing symptoms."
