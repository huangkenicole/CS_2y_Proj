        "Depression tends not to be accurately identified and treated in primary care settings. Women of color are especially likely to use these settings for mental health issues but are less likely to be diagnosed appropriately. A study was conducted within four Florida primary care clinics serving primarily low-income families. Participants included 321 women (Black, 22%, Hispanic, 23.5%, White, 38.6%) who completed a confidential questionnaire while waiting to be seen by clinic staff. Ten percent reported recent major depression, with 26.7% indicating depressive symptoms during the past two years. Depressed women were significantly more likely to report physical violence during the past year. Respondents turned primarily to family, friends, and medical clinics for their depression. They found turning to clinic staff to be helpful and described psychosocial interventions as useful. Members of all ethnic/racial groups reported barriers to seeking help, including perceived separation between mental health and general health and stigma. Implications are discussed in terms of appropriate community education and screening procedures."
