        "PHQ-9 data from persons living with HIV (PLWH, n\u00a0=\u00a04099) being screened for depression in three clinics in the southeastern USA were used to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI). SI was reported by 352 (8.6\u00a0%); associated with <3\u00a0years since HIV diagnosis (1.69; 95\u00a0%CI 1.35, 2.13), and HIV RNA >50 copies/ml (1.70, 95\u00a0%CI 1.35, 2.14). Data from PLWH enrolled in a depression treatment study were used to determine the association between moderate-to-high risk SI (severity) and SI frequency reported on PHQ-9 screening. Over forty percent of persons reporting that SI occurred on \"more than half the days\" (by the PHQ-9) were assessed as having a moderate-to-high risk for suicide completion during the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. SI, including moderate-to-high risk SI, remains a significant comorbid problem for PLWH who are not fully stabilized in care (as indicated by detectable HIV RNA or HIV diagnosis for less than 3\u00a0years)."
