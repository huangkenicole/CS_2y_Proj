        "To consider how a mental health professional might respond to a newly diagnosed depressed patient who inquires into its potential genetic origins and whether they might pass depression on to their children.",
        "Data are provided on risk and pursuit of genetic pathways.",
        "As most studies have focussed on DSM-defined major depression - and which is not an entity - no definitive data are available, while there are some few studies indicating a greater genetic risk in those with melancholic than those with non-melancholic depression.",
        "We will not know the genetic contribution to clinical depression unless its key sub-types are evaluated as separate conditions. Findings may assist a clinician's response to an inquiring patient."
