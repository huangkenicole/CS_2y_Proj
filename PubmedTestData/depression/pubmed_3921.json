        "Mental health care has recently become a government priority, and depression is a very common mental health problem. Many people feel that the mode of treatment used is less important than the effective delivery of care and intensity of follow up. The authors of this study devised a questionnaire to elicit the views of a small sample of mental health professionals and service users on the quality of current services.",
        "Most respondents felt that there is room for improvement in mental health services. Perceptions of the needs of people with depression focused on care, rather than on specific interventions. The voluntary sector was rated highly in caring for people with depression. Greater awareness among professionals of self-help organisations was seen as beneficial."
