        "We sought to examine the evolution of postpartum anxiety, obsessions and compulsions over time, and the influence of depression on their clinical course. This was a prospective cohort of obstetric patients enrolled at a tertiary care women's hospital. Women were recruited immediately postpartum and followed for 6\u00a0months. Women were screened for depression, state-trait anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and dichotomized by the presence of depression. Four hundred sixty-one women agreed to participate in the study and completed the 2\u00a0weeks postpartum assessment; 331 (72\u00a0%) women completed the assessment at 6\u00a0months postpartum. At 2\u00a0weeks postpartum, 28 (19.9\u00a0%) women with depression had anxiety symptoms, compared to 4 (1.3\u00a0%) women who screened negative for depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, 36 (25.7\u00a0%) women with depression endorsed obsessions and compulsions compared to 19 (8.4\u00a0%) women without depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A significant interaction effect was present with anxiety over time such that by 6\u00a0months postpartum, there were no differences in symptoms in women with and without depression (p\u2009=\u20090.860). Conversely, the differences in obsessions and compulsions between depressed and non-depressed women persisted (p\u2009=\u20090.017). Women with postpartum depression are more likely to experience comorbid state-trait anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. While state-trait anxiety symptoms tend to resolve with time, obsessive-compulsive symptoms persist. Understanding these temporal trends is critical to tailor appropriate monitoring and treatment."
