        "Studies have suggested that psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are associated with behavioral problems in adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between domains of PLEs, suicidal ideation, and depression in a large community sample of adolescents. The sample consisted of 8096 Korean subjects (3184 boys and 4912 girls) aged 14 to 19 years. The level of PLEs, depression, and suicidal ideation were assessed by the Eppendorf schizophrenia inventory (ESI), Beck's depression inventory, and Beck's scale for suicidal ideation, respectively. Both the level of depression and suicidal ideation were significantly associated with PLEs. Among the four domains of the ESI, the deviant perception, ideas of reference, and auditory uncertainty were associated with the suicidal ideation. Additionally, subjects with more PLEs had significantly more suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. PLEs in adolescents are associated with potential risk of suicide and depressive symptoms significantly mediated the association between suicidal ideation and PLEs. The presence of perceptual disturbances, ideas of reference, and depression may be regarded as warning signs for suicide-related behaviors."
