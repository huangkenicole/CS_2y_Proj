        "Key lifestyle-environ risk factors are operative for depression, but it is unclear how risk factors cluster. Machine-learning (ML) algorithms exist that learn, extract, identify and map underlying patterns to identify groupings of depressed individuals without constraints. The aim of this research was to use a large epidemiological study to identify and characterise depression clusters through \"Graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods\" (GLUMM).",
        "Two ML algorithms were implemented: unsupervised Self-organised mapping (SOM) to create GLUMM clusters and a supervised boosted regression algorithm to describe clusters. Ninety-six \"lifestyle-environ\" variables were used from the National health and nutrition examination study (2009-2010). Multivariate logistic regression validated clusters and controlled for possible sociodemographic confounders.",
        "The SOM identified two GLUMM cluster solutions. These solutions contained one dominant depressed cluster (GLUMM5-1, GLUMM7-1). Equal proportions of members in each cluster rated as highly depressed (17%). Alcohol consumption and demographics validated clusters. Boosted regression identified GLUMM5-1 as more informative than GLUMM7-1. Members were more likely to: have problems sleeping; unhealthy eating; \u22642\u00a0years in their home; an old home; perceive themselves underweight; exposed to work fumes; experienced sex at \u226414\u00a0years; not perform moderate recreational activities. A positive relationship between GLUMM5-1 (OR: 7.50, P<0.001) and GLUMM7-1 (OR: 7.88, P<0.001) with depression was found, with significant interactions with those married/living with partner (P=0.001).",
        "Using ML based GLUMM to form ordered depressive clusters from multitudinous lifestyle-environ variables enabled a deeper exploration of the heterogeneous data to uncover better understandings into relationships between the complex mental health factors."
