        "Research has shown that state emotion can affect emotion regulation strategies in healthy samples. Emotion regulation plays an important role in depression. We hypothesized that for depressed individuals, experiencing anxiety or anger affects emotion regulation strategy use differently than experiencing sadness.",
        "Individuals diagnosed with chronic or recurrent depression (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009386) responded to vignettes of hypothetical stressors and reported their state emotions and emotion regulation strategies in a thought-listing procedure. We modeled the effect of reporting anger or anxiety compared to sadness on the use of seven emotion regulation strategies: avoidance, distraction, other-blame, problem-solving, rumination, self-blame, and social support.",
        "Compared to sadness, anger was associated with a greater likelihood of using other-blame, and a lower likelihood of using avoidance, rumination, or self-blame. Compared to sadness, anxiety was associated with a greater likelihood of using self-blame. Responses with anger or anxiety did not significantly differ from sadness in coder-rated adaptiveness.",
        "Differences in observed emotion regulation strategy use were correlated with the discrete emotions experienced, and not overall adaptiveness of a response. These results highlight the importance of assessing for emotion type when studying emotion regulation strategy use in depression."
