        "The management of perinatal depression (PND) is challenging in China. The Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), developed under the core theory of cognitive-behavioural therapy, is an evidence-based approach that is recommended as a psychosocial intervention for managing PND in low/middle-income countries. Sparse evidence has been generated, however, to assess the effectiveness of THP and guide its implementation in China.",
        "A hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation study is ongoing in four cities in Anhui Province, China. A comprehensive online platform, Mom's Good Mood (MGM), has been developed. Perinatal women are screened using the WeChat screening tool (ie, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale embedded as metrics) in clinics. Different intensities of the intervention are delivered through the mobile application for different degrees of depression, according to the stratified care model. The THP WHO treatment manual has been tailored to be the core component of intervention. Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework, process evaluations will be conducted to identify the facilitators and barriers to implementation and to modify the implementation strategy; summative evaluations will be carried out to examine the effectiveness of MGM in the management of PND within the primary healthcare system in China.",
        "Ethics approval and consent for this programme were obtained from Institutional Review Boards in China: Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China (20170358). Results will be submitted to relevant conferences and peer-reviewed journals.",
