        "This paper reports on the regional prevalence of symptoms of depression and clinical depression (current major depressive episodes) in Greece in the years 1978 and 1984. Prevalence rates were estimated from two extensive, nationwide cross-sectional home surveys on psychosocial issues and health, carried out in four geographical areas: the Greater Athens area, the Greater Thessaloniki area, the rest of the urban areas and rural areas. The methodology used, the sampling procedure and the screening instrument (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) were the same in both surveys. Within the 6-year period a substantial increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression in all geographic areas was observed, with the Athenian respondents expressing a higher number of symptoms of depression than their counterparts from the other areas. The prevalence of current major depressive episodes, according to specific criteria matched with criteria from the DSM III R, was increased in 1984 in Athens and in the rural areas only. We suggest that economic instability between 1978 and 1984 probably contributed to the changes in the rates of depressive disorders."
