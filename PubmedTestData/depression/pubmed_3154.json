        "Depression in the workplace is a significant factor for reduced personal well-being and productivity. Consequently, this has negative effects on the economic success of the companies in which depressed people are employed. In addition, the economy has to deal with the significant burden of this illness on the health system. In this paper, we investigated how different working contexts-working in a group or individually-influenced depressed individuals towards higher or lower well-being and productivity. We examined this using a laboratory experiment. In this setting, we were also able to analyze how, in turn, a depressive individual impacted the productivity and affective situation of their workgroup, reflecting the company perspective. The experimental design mimicked the very basic processes of a workplace in a stylized way. We used two distinct samples: subclinically and clinically depressed, both working in a group with healthy controls. As expected, we found generally lower performance in the clinically depressed sample, but in the subclinically depressed sample, we only found this in the individual work context. In contrast to our expectations, the performance of subclinically depressed individuals working in groups with healthy controls was even higher than that of healthy controls in homogenously healthy groups. The performance of the entire group with a depressed member was lower for the sample with clinically manifested depression, while the performance of groups with a subclinically depressed participant was significantly higher than the performance of homogeneously non-depressed control groups. We discuss our results with a focus on the design of workplaces to both re-integrate clinically depressed employees and prevent subclinically depressed employees from developing major depression."
