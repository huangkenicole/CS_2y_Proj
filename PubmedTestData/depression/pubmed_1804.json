        "The prevalence of depression among 74 male and 211 female patients aged 75 years or over registered with a group general practice was assessed, using the geriatric depression scale. Test scores of 0- 10, suggesting no depressive illness, were observed in 63 (85%) men and 172 (82%) women. Mild depression (scores 11-20) was observed in 10 (14%) men and 36(17%) women and severe depression (scores 21-30) in one (1%) man and three (1%) women. No significant statistical association was found with age or sex, suggesting that elderly men and women are equally prone to depression.A general practitioner found clinical manifestations of depression in 29 of the patients (10%). The geriatric depression scale scores were compared with clinical diagnoses of depression. Those with high scores were more likely to be depressed and vice versa. Thirty two elderly patients (11%) with no clinical manifestation of depression recorded high scores on the geriatric depression scale. These patients may be described as ;psychiatric cases'. Uncertainty about the importance of early identification of these cases necessitates further screening and regular follow-up of elderly patients."
