        "Subsyndromal depressive symptoms seem to be quite prevalent in mood disorders although very few studies have assessed them in patients considered to be in remission by clinical and psychometric criteria. This study sought to evaluate the presence of subsyndromal depressive symptoms in bipolar and unipolar patients in clinical remission.",
        "One-hundred seventy-six patients with DSM-IV bipolar (62 bipolar I, 58 bipolar II) or unipolar mayor depression (n=58) in clinical remission and 60 healthy subjects were assessed using several psychometric instruments including the 17 items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). To be considered in clinical remission patients assessed with the Clinical Impression for Bipolar Disorder-Modified (CGI-BP-M) had to be stable for 6 months and scoring 6 or less in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and 8 or less in the HDRS.",
        "Both Unipolar Disorder (UD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) patients in clinical remission presented statistically significant higher HRSD scores, than healthy subjects. The HRSD scores were statistically higher in UD patients under remission than in BD patients. The subsyndromal symptoms more strongly associated with a clinical diagnosis of either UD or BD were Depressed Mood, Somatic Anxiety, Impact on Work and Activities, Psychic Anxiety, Gastrointestinal and Somatic Symptoms, Retardation during the Interview and Genital Symptoms.",
        "Subsyndromal depressive symptoms are present in affective disorder patients, both UD and BD, who apparently are in clinical remission. Remitted unipolar patients may have more residual symptoms than bipolar patients, particularly in items related to anxiety and somatic complaints."
