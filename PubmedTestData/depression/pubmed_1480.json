        "The study aimed to design and evaluate a program for the prevention of childhood depression (\"Pozik-Bizi\" [in English, \"Live-Happily\"]), comparing its effects with a socio-emotional intervention program based on cooperative play. The sample comprised 420 students aged 7 to 10\u2009years from the Basque Country, 51.9% were randomly assigned to the experimental condition (\"Pozik-Bizi\") program and 48.1% to the control group (\"Play program\"). Using a pretest-posttest repeated measures experimental design, 7 evaluation instruments were administered. When comparing the two interventions, it was confirmed that those who participated in the \"Pozik-Bizi\" program significantly decreased their level of clinical maladjustment, school maladjustment, emotional, and behavioral problems, and they increased positive behaviors that inhibit depression. However, the cooperative play program improved self-concept and social skills significantly more than the \"Pozik-Bizi\" program. The effect size in all the variables was small. The discussion analyzes the effectiveness of specific programs of prevention of childhood depression versus global programs of social-emotional development. This work provides a program to prevent childhood depression that has been shown to be effective in the reduction of clinical variables. In addition, this study confirms the positive potential of programs of cooperative play, to increase self-concept and social skills."
