        "To investigate serum neurofilament light (sNfL) levels in acute ischemic stroke and to assess whether sNfL are related to the severity of disease and a potential prognostic marker of post-stroke depression (PSD) during a 3-month follow-up period.",
        "This was a single-center prospective cohort study. The sNfL concentration was measured in baseline samples using the Simoa platform- Single Molecule Array technology. A psychiatrist administered the Structural Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV to all patients and made a diagnosis of PSD 3\u00a0months after stroke. The logistic regression was used to examine the association between sNfL and PSD.",
        "In total, 236 ischemic stroke cases were included and finished the follow-up. In the follow-up, 55 patients were defined as PSD, thus the incidence rate was 23.3% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 17.9%-28.7%). Significant differences were observed between the sNfL levels in patients with PSD (124.8\u00a0pg/ml [interquartile range {IQR}: 59.6-159.2]) and in patients without PSD (35.9\u00a0pg/ml [IQR: 18.2-60.4]) levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjusting for age, family history of depression, marital status, National Institutes of Health and Stroke Scale score, C-reactive protein and homocysteine levels, sNfL levels independently predicted the development of post-stroke depression. The crude and adjusted odds ratios [OR] (and 95%CI) of PSD associated with an IQR increase for sNfL were 3.38(2.29, 4.98) and 2.65(1.59, 4.04), respectively. According to receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) curves, the cut-off value of sNfL to predict PSD was 111.4\u00a0pg/ml with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84(95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and with the highest sensitivity (61.8%) and specificity (95.4%).",
        "In this study, elevated level of sNfL is associated with higher risk of 3-month depression in patients with ischemic stroke and makes early diagnoses of depression. The study needs replication to ensure the validity of our preliminary results."
