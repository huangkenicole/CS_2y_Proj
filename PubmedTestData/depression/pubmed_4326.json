        "Depression affects millions globally and often coexists with cognitive deficits. This study explored the potential of probiotics in enhancing cognition and ameliorating depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder patients.",
        "Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol and the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design framework, we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials examining probiotic effects on cognition and depressive symptoms. Searches spanned 7 databases from January 2010 to May 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0, and meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.4.1. Publication bias was evaluated via Egger test.",
        "In a systematic review on the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognition and depressive symptoms in depression patients, 635 records were initially identified, with 4 studies ultimately included. These randomized controlled trials were conducted across diverse regions, primarily involving females, with assessment periods ranging from 1 to 2 months. Concerning cognitive outcomes, a statistically significant moderate improvement was found with probiotic supplementation, based on the mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. However, for depressive symptoms, the overall effect was negligible and not statistically significant. A heterogeneity test indicated consistent findings across studies for both cognitive and depressive outcomes (I\u00b2\u2005=\u20050% for both). The potential for publication bias was evaluated using the Egger linear regression test, suggesting no significant bias, though caution is advised due to the limited number of studies.",
        "Probiotics may enhance cognitive domains and mitigate depressive symptoms, emphasizing the gut-brain axis role. However, methodological variations and brief intervention durations call for more standardized, extensive research."
