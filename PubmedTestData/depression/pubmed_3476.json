        "From one hand, depression is one of the symptoms that occur after abstinence from methamphetamine. On the other people living with HIV/AIDS are in isolation due to the nature of their illness and depression is one of the most common mental health problems they experience.",
        "This study was aimed at determining the effectiveness of saffron on reducing depression among recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS.",
        "The design of this study was semi-experimental with pre-test, post-test and control (placebo) groups. The statistical population consisted of all recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS who were referred to the Positive Club. Fifty-seven (57) recovered consumers of methamphetamine, living with HIV/AIDS, were selected by convenience sampling method. They were randomly assigned to an experimental (saffron) group and a control (placebo) group. The experimental group received 30\u00a0ml of saffron per day for 8\u00a0weeks, whereas the control (placebo) group received placebo the same way. BDI-II was used in this study as a measurement instrument. ANCOVA models were used for statistical inference.",
        "The findings showed that saffron and its ingredients had been effective in reducing depression among this group (P < 0.05).",
        "In fact, saffron with its active ingredients (Crusin and Saffranal) by serotonin and dopamine secretion in the brain, help in reducing depression among recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS."
