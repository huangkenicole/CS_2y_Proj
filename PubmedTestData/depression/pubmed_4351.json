        "Antidepressants are often only moderately successful in decreasing the severity of depressive symptoms. In part, antidepressant treatment response in patients with depression is genetically determined. However, although a large number of studies have been conducted aiming to identify genetic variants associated with antidepressant drug response in depression, only a few variants have been repeatedly identified. Within the present review, we will discuss the methodological challenges and limitations of the studies that have been conducted on this topic to date (e.g., 'treated-only design', statistical power) and we will discuss how specifically drug-gene interaction models can be used to be better able to identify genetic variants associated with antidepressant drug response in depression."
