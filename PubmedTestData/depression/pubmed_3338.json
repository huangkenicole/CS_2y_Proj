        "To what extent depression may negatively impact successful aging with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. We examined the impact of depression/depressive symptoms on lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol), participation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among older people living with MS (n\u00a0=\u00a0742).",
        "Based on self-reported depression diagnosis and scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, we divided the sample into four groups: 1. No depression diagnosis and low symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a0412), 2. Diagnosed with depression and low symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a0103), 3. Diagnosed with depression and high symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a087), and 4. No depression diagnosis and high symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a0140). We used regression modelling to predict outcomes, controlling for age, MS disease duration, type of MS at initial diagnosis and disability.",
        "A high proportion (44.5%) reported either being diagnosed with depression, having high levels of symptoms or both. Only 12.1% reported that they were prescribed anti-depressants and 13.6% utilized psychosocial services. Compared to those with depression who had low symptoms, respondents who had high depressive symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a0227) were more likely to be non-exercisers (OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.02-3.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), consume a poor diet (OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.27-3.52, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), have the lowest levels of participation (OR 3.36, 95%CI 1.74-6.49, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) and report the poorest HRQoL (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.17-3.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Men and people experiencing higher levels of disability and fatigue were at greater risk of having high symptoms and being undiagnosed.",
