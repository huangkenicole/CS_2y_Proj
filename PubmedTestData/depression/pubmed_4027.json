        "Behavioral activation (BA) is a beneficial and relatively cost-effective treatment option for depression. This study utilized a pragmatic randomized controlled research design to investigate whether BA, as compared with treatment as usual (TAU), led to superior treatment effects, when delivered in community mental health settings by retrained community mental health professionals. Patients with depressive disorders (n\u2009=\u200964) were randomly assigned to a 10-session BA (n\u2009=\u200931) or TAU (n\u2009=\u200933) group. The depressive symptoms and behavioral engagement were assessed at the baseline, post-treatment, and a six-month follow-up. Results showed that, as compared to the TAU group, the BA group had: (1) a reduction in depression severity, as evidenced by large effect sizes and greater response rates, and (2) an increase in behavioral engagement. However, the post-treatment gains were not maintained at the six-month follow-up. The implications and limitations of the study are also discussed (KCT0004098, June 27, 2019, retrospectively registered)."
