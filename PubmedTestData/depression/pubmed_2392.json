        "Apathy is prevalent among individuals with late-life depression and is associated with poor response to pharmacotherapy, including chronicity and disability. Elucidating brain networks associated with apathy and poor treatment outcomes can inform intervention development.",
        "To assess the brain network features of apathy among individuals with late-life depression and identify brain network abnormalities associated with poor antidepressant response.",
        "This secondary analysis of a single-group, open-label nonrandomized clinical trial of escitalopram conducted at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry clinic enrolled 40 adults aged 59 to 85 years with major depressive disorder from July 1, 2012, to July 31, 2019.",
        "After a 2-week washout period, participants received escitalopram titrated to a target of 20 mg/d for 12 weeks.",
        "Baseline and posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical, and cognitive assessments were conducted. Functional MRI was used to map group differences in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the salience network, and diffusion MRI connectometry was performed to evaluate pathway-level disruptions in structural connectivity. The Apathy Evaluation Scale was used to quantify apathy, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to quantify the primary outcome of depression severity.",
        "Forty participants (26 women [65%]; mean [SD] age, 70.0 [6.6] years [range, 59-85 years]) with depression were included; 20 participants (50%) also had apathy. Relative to nonapathetic participants with depression, those with depression and apathy had lower rsFC of salience network seeds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), premotor cortex, midcingulate cortex, and paracentral lobule and greater rsFC with the lateral temporal cortex and temporal pole (z score >2.7; Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P\u2009<\u2009.0125). Compared with participants without apathy, those with apathy had lower structural connectivity in the splenium, cingulum, and fronto-occipital fasciculus (t score >2.5; false discovery rate-corrected P\u2009=\u2009.02). Twenty-seven participants completed escitalopram treatment; 16 (59%) achieved remission (HAM-D score <10). Lower insula-DLPFC/midcingulate cortex rsFC was associated with less symptomatic improvement (HAM-D % change) (\u03b2 [df]\u2009=\u20090.588 [26]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and a higher likelihood of nonremission (odds ratio, 1.041 [95% CI, 1.003-1.081]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) after treatment and, in regression models, was a mediator of the association between baseline apathy and persistence of depression. Lower dorsal anterior cingulate-DLPFC/paracentral rsFC was associated with residual cognitive difficulties on measures of attention (\u03b2 [df] = 0.445 [26]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and executive function (\u03b2 [df] = 0.384 [26]; P\u2009=\u2009.04).",
        "This study suggests that disturbances in connectivity between the salience network and other large-scale networks that support goal-directed behavior may give rise to apathy and may be associated with poor response of late-life depression to antidepressant pharmacotherapy. These network disturbances may serve as targets for novel interventions.",
