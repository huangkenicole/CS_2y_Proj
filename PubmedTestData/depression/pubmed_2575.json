        "The goal was to determine clinical and genealogical and pathophysiological markers of the risk recurrent depression development risk. Clinical and psychopathological, genealogical, psychometric (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale - MADRS), \"Psychological Autobiography\" method (Burlachuk L.F., Korzhova E.Yu., 1998), methods of mathematical statistics. A survey of 108 patients with recurrent depression (ICD10, F33.0-33.2) compared with 46 individuals in the general population, found a high level of family burden of depression, at all degrees and levels of relatedness with recurrent depressive disorder in the patients' parentage. Thus, it is shown that the patients' percentage that has been placed on a psychiatric register (18%, CI: 14.5-22.1) was 15 times higher than in the comparison group (p <0.05), patients with depression (33%, CI: 28.5-37.8) - 7.3 times higher (p <0.05), suicide (7.9%, CI: 5.6-11.0) - in 4.2 times higher (p<0.05), cases of alcohol dependence (25.6%, CI: 21.6-30.2) - 1.8 times higher (p<0.05). According to the results of the statistical analysis, it has been determined that both hereditary and sociopsychological factors act as predictors of depression, which increase the probability of depression's developing risk or anti-risk. The most informative signs of the arising depression risk were: observation by a psychiatrist (DC=-5.78, MI=1.40), the presence of depression (DC=-8.69, MI=1.24), suicidal behavior (DC=-6.15), MI=0.18) and alcohol dependence (DC=-2.53, MI=0.14) in the probands' parentage, the presence of a high level in the subjective life negative events' perception path related to health (their or relatives) (DC=-2.83, MI=0.23) in patients. The data obtained indicate the following - the formation and development of depressive pathology due to the hereditary factors influence combined with patient's psychological state negative features (high level in the subjective perception of the life path negative health events (own or loved ones)."
