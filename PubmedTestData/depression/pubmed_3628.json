        "Major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated structural and functional abnormalities in adult depression. However, the neurobiology of adolescent depression has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of voxel-level whole-brain functional networks in first-episode, drug-na\u00efve adolescents with MDD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 66 depressed adolescents and 47 matched healthy controls. Voxel-wise degree centrality (DC) analysis was performed to identify voxels that showed altered whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) with other voxels. We further conducted seed-based FC analysis to investigate in more detail the connectivity patterns of the identified DC changes. The relationship between altered DC and clinical variables in depressed adolescents was also analyzed. Compared with controls, depressed adolescents showed lower DC in the bilateral hippocampus, left superior temporal gyrus and right insula. Seed-based analysis revealed that depressed adolescents, relative to controls, showed hypoconnectivity between the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal regions and right precuneus. Furthermore, the DC values in the bilateral hippocampus were correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and duration of disease (all P\u2009<\u20090.05, false discovery rate corrected). Our study indicates abnormal intrinsic dysconnectivity patterns of whole-brain functional networks in drug-na\u00efve, first-episode adolescents with MDD, and abnormal DC in the hippocampus may affect the association of prefrontal-hippocampus circuit. These findings may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of adolescent-onset MDD."
