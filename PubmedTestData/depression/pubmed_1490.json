        "Few studies examine the effect of interpersonal, regulatory or legal coercion on the treatment of depressive symptoms. This retrospective case-control study compared the recovery rates of 574 adults whose level of coercion was scored on a 0-3 scale from fully voluntary to severe coercion when admitted to the Menninger Clinic between 2009 and 2014. The change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores (measuring depression severity) from admission to discharge served as the primary outcome measure. Level of coercion was not associated with a difference in rate of improvement in PHQ-9 score. Greater improvement in PHQ-9 scores was associated with (a) older age, (b) lack of a psychotic spectrum disorder diagnosis, (c) stronger working alliance with treatment team, and (d) less difficulty with emotional regulation [lower Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) scores]. DERS scores were the most impactful factor. This study suggests that licensure boards can continue to mandate treatment despite concerns that coercion may decrease treatment effectiveness."
