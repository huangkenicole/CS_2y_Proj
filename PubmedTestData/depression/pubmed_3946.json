        "Our study provides data on depression and anxiety in long-term cancer survivors, in men, women and various age groups, as well as identifies associated factors and coping-related resources.",
        "We present data obtained from 1002 cancer survivors across a large variety of tumour entities 5\u00a0years (cohort 1) and 10\u00a0years (cohort 2) after diagnosis, in a cross-sectional study. We analysed depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptomatology in comparison with two large age- and sex-matched samples randomly selected from the general population.",
        "Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were reported in 17% and 9% of cancer survivors, respectively. There were no significant differences between the 5\u00a0years and 10\u00a0years after diagnosis cohorts (p\u2009=\u20090.232). In both cohorts, we found higher depression and anxiety in women than in men (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and lower depression and anxiety in elderly patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Cancer survivors younger than 60\u00a0years of age were more depressed and anxious than the general population (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The variables, financial problems (Beta\u2009=\u20090.16, p\u2009<\u20090.001), global quality of life (Beta\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.21, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cognitive function (Beta\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.30, p\u2009<\u20090.001), had the strongest association with depression and anxiety.",
        "For the prevention of depression and anxiety in long-term cancer survivors, individual treatment of physical and psychological symptoms is as important as social support and professional counselling. Post-treatment, cognitive limitations should be carefully assessed in long-term cancer survivorship to distinguish them from symptoms of a mental disorder, especially since younger cancer survivors of working age and female survivors seem to be more affected by depression and anxiety."
