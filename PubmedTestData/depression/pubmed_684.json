        "Despite the great burden of depression on sufferers and society, there is a lack of reliable information regarding the full range of psychosocial difficulties associated with depression and their related variables. This systematic review aimed to demonstrate the utility of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in describing the psychosocial difficulties that shape the lived experience of persons with depression.",
        "An electronic search that included publications from 2005 to 2010 in the MEDLINE and PsycHINFO databases was conducted to collect psychosocial outcomes. Quality of studies was also considered.",
        "103 studies were included. 477 outcomes referring psychosocial difficulties were extracted and grouped into 32 ICF related categories. Emotional functions (19% of studies), followed by energy and drive (17% of studies), were the most frequent psychosocial outcomes. The onset, course, determinants, and related variables of the most important psychosocial difficulties, reported in at least 10% of studies, were described. Medication played a dual role as determinant of onset and change in some psychosocial areas, e.g. in pain, sleep, and energy and drive.",
        "The search was limited by year of publication and focused only on minor and major depression diagnoses: other depressive disorders were not included. Some underresearched, but relevant psychosocial areas could have not been analyzed.",
        "The present systematic review provides information on the psychosocial difficulties that depressive patients face in their daily lives. Future studies on depression should include outcome instruments that cover these relevant areas in order to comprehensively describe psychosocial functioning."
