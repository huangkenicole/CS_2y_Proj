        "The current study compared the perceptions of family functioning between daughters with eating disorders (EDs) and their parents. This investigation was an expansion of the Fornari et al (Compr Psychiatry 1999;40:434-441) study, which investigated the relationship between the perceived family functioning and depressive symptoms in individuals with ED patients receiving outpatient services.",
        "One hundred twenty-six female subjects, ranging in age from 13 to 34 years (mean 18.3 years) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Arch Gen Psychiatry 1961;4:561-571) and the Family Assessment Device (FAD) (J Marital Fam Ther 1983;9:171-180) on admission to an outpatient ED program. The patient's parent(s) (118 mothers and 96 fathers) also completed the FAD. Eating disorder subgroup diagnosis and major depressive disorder diagnosis were established according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition , criteria, using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime (Arch Gen Psychiatry 1987;35:837-844). Repeated measures analysis of covariance was performed comparing family members on each of the 7 subscales of the FAD with BDI entered as the covariate.",
        "Statistically significant differences were found between patient and parental perceptions of overall family functioning. Mothers rated family functioning as significantly healthier and less chaotic than their daughters did. There were fewer significant differences between maternal and paternal perceptions of family functioning, and no significant differences between fathers' and daughters' perceptions of the family. Eating disorder diagnosis did not contribute to these differences in perception of family functioning. In addition, high self-reported depressive symptoms of the daughters were related to the perception of high family dysfunction for all 3 informants; depressive symptoms did not, however, alter the differences in perception between family members.",
        "Differences in viewpoints between parents and daughters regarding the family environment may contribute to the continuation of a dysfunctional family pattern and maintenance of the ED and/or impact negatively on the course of treatment. Possible implications for treatment are discussed, particularly because of the differences of the mothers' views. The results of this study strongly support the importance of including the patient's family in the initial evaluation, regardless of the patient's age."
