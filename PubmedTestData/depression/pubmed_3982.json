        "Stressful life events (SLEs) are high-risk factors for subthreshold depressive symptoms (SDS) and major depressive disorder (MDD). This study sought to assess the association of SLEs with SDS and MDD, with a focus on gender effects.",
        "A total of 4132 participants were recruited from 34 primary health care settings. The Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ) was used to measure SLEs that participants had experienced in the past time. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess SDS, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI) depression module was used to assess the diagnosis of MDD by trained psychiatrists.",
        "In our sample (N\u00a0=\u00a04132), exposure to any SLEs was more common in individuals with SDS and MDD than in non-depressed population, and the proportion of emotional abuse was relatively high (SDS: 10.6\u00a0%; MDD: 33.9\u00a0%). After adjusting for control variables, people who experienced SLEs were at a higher risk of SDS and MDD. For males, those experiencing only one event were not at a higher risk of SDS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.061). For individuals who had experienced multiple SLEs, the association between SLEs and SDS was stronger in females than males. However, the association between SLEs and MDD was stronger in males than females.",
        "The cross-sectional study design and self-reported SLEs.",
        "SLEs were associated with the increased risks of SDS and MDD. The associations of SLEs with SDS were more robust for females than males. In contrast, the association between SLEs and MDD was stronger in males than females."
