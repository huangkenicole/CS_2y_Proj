        "Major depressive disorder (MDD) with atypical features, namely depression with atypical features (AFD), is one of the most common clinical specifiers of MDD, closely associated with bipolar disorder (BD). However, there is still a lack of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AFD. Our study mainly focuses on three issues about how to identify AFD, what is the appropriate individualized treatment for AFD, and what are the predictive biomarkers of conversion to BD.",
        "The Study of Individualized Diagnosis and Treatment for Depression with Atypical Features (iDoT-AFD) is a multicenter, prospective, open-label study consisting of a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a continued follow-up until 4 years or reaching the study endpoint. It is enrolling 480 patients with AFD (120 per treatment arm), 100 patients with BD, and 100 healthy controls (HC). Multivariate dimension information is collected including clinical features, cognitive function, kynurenine pathway metabolomics, and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Firstly, multivariate informatics analyses are performed to recognize patients with AFD from participants including the first-episode and recurrent atypical depression, patients with BD, and patients with HC. Secondly, patients with atypical depression are randomly allocated to one of the four treatment groups including \"single application of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)\", \"SSRI/SNRI combined with mood stabilizer,\" \"SSRI/SNRI combined with quetiapine (\u2265 150 mg/day),\" or \"treatment as usual (TAU)\" and then followed up 12 weeks to find out the optimized treatment strategies. Thirdly, patients with atypical depression are followed up until 4 years or switching to BD, to explore the risk factors of conversion from atypical depression to BD and eventually build the risk warning model of conversion to BD.",
        "The first enrolment was in August 2019. The iDoT-AFD study explores the clinical and biological markers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AFD and further provides evidence for clinical guidelines of AFD.",
