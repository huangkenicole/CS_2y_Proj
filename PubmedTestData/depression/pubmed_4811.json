        "People with depression select avoidant emotion regulation (ER) strategies more often than engagement strategies. While psychotherapy improves ER strategies, examining the week-to-week changes in ER and their relationship to clinical outcomes is warranted to understand how these interventions work. This study examined the changes in six ER strategies and depressive symptoms during virtual psychotherapy.",
        "Treatment-seeking adults (N\u00a0=\u00a056) with moderate depression severity completed a baseline diagnostic interview and questionnaires and were followed for up to 3\u00a0months as they completed virtual psychotherapy in an unrestricted format (e.g., individual) and orientation (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT). Participants completed weekly assessments of depression and six ER strategies along with assessments of CBT skills and participant-rated CBT components for each psychotherapy session. Multilevel modeling was used to examine associations between within-person changes in ER strategy use and weekly depression scores, controlling for between-person effects and time.",
        "Depressive symptoms, rumination, and experiential avoidance decreased non-linearly over time while cognitive reappraisal and acceptance increased non-linearly. Controlling for CBT skills, within-person increases in acceptance and cognitive reappraisal, as well as within-person decreases in experiential avoidance, were associated with fewer depressive symptoms over time. People who reported greater CBT components in their sessions also reported fewer depressive symptoms over time.",
        "The study was unable to make more causal inferences or standardize the type, baseline, or length of psychotherapy received.",
        "Improvements in ER strategies were associated with depression symptom reduction during psychotherapy. Future research to elucidate ER strategies as mediators of treatment response is warranted."
