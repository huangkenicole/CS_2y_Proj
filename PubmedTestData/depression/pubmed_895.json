        "Depression is highly comorbid and depressive symptoms are very common. Symptom severity adversely affects treatment outcome and later health status. Established interventions for depression leave ample room for improvement. Short interventions that target specific vulnerabilities emerge as plausible augmentation strategies. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a computerized general positivity-approach training and its effect on depressive symptoms.",
        "Patients (N\u202f=\u202f240) with various diagnoses of mental disorders who received treatment-as-usual in an inpatient setting were randomly assigned to also receive either 4 sessions of a positivity-approach training or 4 sessions of sham training. Depression severity was assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Training data were analyzed for a subset of 111 patients.",
        "Depressive symptoms were reduced more after positivity-approach training than after sham training. Initial depression symptom severity moderated the intervention effects, such that approach tendencies and depression symptoms were only affected positively among patients with higher levels of initial depression symptom severity.",
        "The findings provide preliminary support for positivity-approach training as an add-on treatment option for depressive symptoms."
