        "Effects of Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for anxiety and depression are not well understood when delivered in non-specialized as compared to specialized clinic settings. This open trial (n=458 patients) examined the benefits of transdiagnostic-ICBT when delivered in Canada by therapists (registered providers or graduate students) working in either a specialized online clinic or one of eight nonspecialized community clinics. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Completion rates and satisfaction were high. Significant and large reductions (effect sizes 1.17-1.31) were found on symptom measures. Completion rates, satisfaction levels and outcomes did not differ whether ICBT was delivered by therapists working in a specialized online clinic or nonspecialized community clinics. Differences were also not found between registered providers and graduate students, or therapists trained in psychology or another discipline. The findings support the public health potential of ICBT."
