      "AbstractText": [
        "Depression is common in older people, and while the approach to treatment is similar to a younger population, there are several additional treatment considerations to make based on comorbidities and cognitive impairment. Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and problem-solving therapy are recommended for mild-moderate depression in older people; however, the efficacy of these are limited in very old patients (older than 75 years of age) and those with cognitive impairment. Additionally, neuromodulation treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation could prove beneficial for specific older people with depression. Use of pharmacotherapy that has demonstrated to be safe in older adults, as well as agents with adequate clinical experience in this population, should be considered based on patient-specific characteristics. Because of generally more complex medication regimens, risks of pharmacotherapy should be minimized with careful dosing strategies and special attention to avoid significant drug-drug interactions. While some data are available, antidepressant combination or augmentation strategies are less well studied in older people who fail to achieve remission or those with treatment-resistant depression, compared with younger populations."
