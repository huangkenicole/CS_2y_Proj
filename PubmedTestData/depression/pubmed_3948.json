        "The treatment of depression remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for more effective antidepressants. Traditional drug discovery and development is time-consuming and costly, prompting the need for faster translation of novel therapies into practice. But clinical expediency comes at a cost against which potential benefits need to be considered judiciously."
