        "To measure persistence and nonrecurrence of depression treatment and investigate potential risk factors.",
        "We retrospectively observed a closed cohort of insurees with new-onset depression treatment in 2007 and without most psychiatric comorbidity for 16 quarters (plus one to ascertain discontinuation). We linked inpatient/outpatient/drug-data per person and quarter. Person-quarters containing specified depression services were classified as depression-treatment-person-quarters (DTPQ). We defined longterm-DTPQ-persistence as 16\u00a0+\u00a01 continuous DTPQ and longterm-DTPQ-nonrecurrence as 12 continuous quarters without DTPQ and used multivariate logistic regression to explore associations with these outcomes.",
        "Within first 16 quarters, 28,348 patients' first period (total time) persisted for a mean/median 5.4/3 (8.7/8) quarters. Fourteen percent had longterm-DTPQ-persistence, associated (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) with baseline hospital (odds ratio, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.80), psychotherapy/specialist-interview and antidepressants (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.81), age (years, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.03), unemployment (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.21), retirement (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.31), and insured as a dependent (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32). Thirty-four percent had longterm-DTPQ-nonrecurrence, associated with psychotherapy/specialist-interview (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.40), antidepressants (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.54), female sex (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84), age (years, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.99), retirement (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18), and insured as a dependent (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.88). Women differed for episodic and not chronic treatment.",
        "Treatment measures compared to survey's symptoms measures. We suggest further research on \"treatment-free-time.\" Antidepressants(-) and psychotherapy/specialist-interview(+) were significantly associated with longterm-DTPQ-nonrecurrence. This was presumably moderated by possible short-time/low-dosage antidepressants use(-) and selective therapy assignment(+). Sample selectivity limited data misclassification."
