      "AbstractText": [
        "There is evidence that symptomatology in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) changes with age. However, studies comparing depressive symptomatology between different age groups during antidepressant therapy are rare. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics in depressed patients of different age groups at baseline and during treatment.",
        "889 MDD inpatients were divided into four age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-65\u00a0yrs.). Demographic and clinical characteristics including depressive symptomatology (assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms) were assessed at baseline and weekly during treatment.",
        "At baseline, young patients (18-29\u00a0years) significantly more often reported cognitive symptoms like irritability, suicidality, negative self-concept and interpersonal sensitivity and more often suffered from drug abuse and comorbid personality disorders. Late middle aged patients (50-65\u00a0years) significantly more often suffered from neuro-vegetative symptoms such as reduced general interest, sexual interest and sleep disturbances and more often showed a recurrent MDD and comorbid physical disorders. During therapy, symptoms such as interpersonal sensitivity in young patients and low interest in sex in late middle aged patients persisted until the end of treatment while all other symptoms declined until day 56.",
        "The herein presented age differences in depressive symptomatology only hold true for the study medication and are not generalizable to other antidepressants agents.",
        "There are substantial differences in the clinical presentation of depression between age groups. Whereas many of these differences disappear during treatment, some differences persisted until the end of treatment. These findings my help to more specifically tailor the treatment of depressed patients."
