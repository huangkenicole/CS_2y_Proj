        "Hospital charts were reviewed for 66 medical and surgical patients who received dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate to treat a depressive disorder. Approximately three-fourths showed some improvement; in half of the sample, improvement was marked or moderate. Of those who improved, 93% reached their peak response within the first 2 days. Relapse occurred in only 5 patients. Side effects were minimal. Nonsignificant trends suggested that dextroamphetamine was more effective for major depression than adjustment disorder, while methylphenidate tended to be more effective for adjustment disorder. Psychostimulants appear to be a therapeutic option in the medically ill depressed population and may be more rapidly effective with fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants."
