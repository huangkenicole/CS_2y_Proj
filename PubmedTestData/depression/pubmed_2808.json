        "Our objectives were to investigate alexithymia in burnout patients while controlling for depression and anxiety, as well as to evaluate whether alexithymia may be part of a profound emotional processing disorder or of a mentalization deficit. Alexithymia, depressive, and anxious feelings were compared in patients with burnout, depression, and healthy controls using an age-, sex-, and education-matched cross-sectional design (n = 60). A facial emotion recognition task and an emotional mentalizing performance test as well as physical and emotional violation experiences were conducted. Alexithymia was significantly increased in burnout patients, mediated by negative affect in this group. No impairment of facial emotion recognition or mental attribution could be shown. Burnout patients demonstrated slightly increased emotional abuse experiences in early childhood. The present results corroborate the supposition that alexithymia in burnout primarily depends on affect and may rise due to current strain and overload experience, rather than based on a profound developmental disorder in emotion processing."
