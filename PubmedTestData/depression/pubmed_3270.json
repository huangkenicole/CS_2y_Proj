Current case provides a detailed account of a 45-year female diagnosed with diabetes and coronary heart disease having complaints of pain in her joints, sadness and worry, unable to control anger, loss of interest in previous pleasurable activities, reduced interaction with others, and difficulty falling asleep. After assessment, patient was diagnosed with 293.83 (F06.31) depression due to diabetes and coronary heart disease, with depressive features and V61.03 (Z63.5) disruption of family by separation or divorce. Cognitive and behavioural approach was used for treatment, which significantly reduced complaints of patient."
