        "Depressive symptoms of patients with intracranial tumors need to be assessed adequately. The Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) is an ultra-short screening tool consisting of four items, a cutoff of six indicates depressive symptoms. The aim was to assess patients' psychological burden by the PHQ-4 compared with the results of well-established screening instruments.",
        "Patients were screened three times after primary diagnosis postoperatively (t1), after 3 (t2) and 6 (t3) months using the PHQ-4, the Hornheide Screening Instrument (HSI), the NCCN Distress Thermometer (DT), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire with its brain module (EORTC QLQ-C30 + BN20). Demographic, tumor-related data, and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were analyzed. A cutoff value for PHQ-4 indicating a need for support or increased distress was determined by applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC).",
        "The proportion of patients reaching a total score \u2265\u20096 was n\u2009=\u200932 out of 139 (23%) at t1; at t2, n\u2009=\u200912 out of 117 (10%) scored \u2265\u20096. At t3, n\u2009=\u20098 out of 96 (8%) scored \u2265\u20096. At t1, PHQ-4 scores did not differ significantly between gender, age groups, and tumor laterality. A cutoff value of 2.5 was identified to moderately discriminate between patients in or not in distress (sensitivity 76.8%) and between patients wishing further, specific support or not (sensitivity 82.5%).",
        "The PHQ4 can be applied in this patient cohort to detect those with relevant psychological comorbidities. The cutoff value should be re-evaluated in a larger cohort as we observed that a cutoff of 6, as recommended previously, may be too high in order to detect affected patients adequately."
