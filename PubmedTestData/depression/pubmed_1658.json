        "Major depression affects 10% of the US adult population annually, contributing to significant burden and impairment. Research indicates treatment response is a non-linear process characterized by combinations of gradual changes and abrupt shifts in depression symptoms, although less is known about differential trajectories of depression symptoms in therapist-supported digital mental health interventions (DMHI).",
        "Repeated measures latent profile analysis was used to empirically identify differential trajectories based upon biweekly depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among patients engaging in a therapist-supported DMHI from January 2020 to July 2021. Multivariate associations between symptom trajectories with sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were examined with multinomial logistic regression. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as a five-point change on the PHQ-9 from baseline to week 12.",
        "The final sample included 2192 patients aged 18 to 82 (mean\u2009=\u200939.1). Four distinct trajectories emerged that differed by symptom severity and trajectory of depression symptoms over 12\u00a0weeks. All trajectories demonstrated reductions in symptoms. Despite meeting MCID criteria, evidence of treatment resistance was found among the trajectory with the highest symptom severity. Chronicity of major depressive episodes and lifetime trauma exposures were ubiquitous across the trajectories in a multinomial logistic regression model.",
        "These data indicate that changes in depression symptoms during DMHI are heterogenous and non-linear, suggesting a need for precision care strategies to address treatment resistance and increase engagement. Future efforts should examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed treatment modules for DMHIs as well as protocols for continuation treatment and relapse prevention."
