        "The number of alternations between Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in humans is usually considered to consist of 4-5 cycles of about 90 minutes duration per night. Previous studies by our group showed a normal distribution on 26 healthy human subjects. The present study retrospectively analyzes the polysomnograms of 2,312 unmedicated patients who were admitted for medical and/or psychiatric reasons in the Erasme University Hospital between 2003 and 2014. The normal distribution of the Number of Cycles and Mean Cycle Duration was confirmed. Q-Q plots were very close to linearity. This distribution allows the use of these variables in parametric comparisons. The Number of Cycles per night and the Mean Cycle Duration showed predominant links with REM sleep-related variables, such as the REM Latency, REM sleep duration, the REM/NREM sleep ratio. None of these variables was associated with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, nor the intensity of Depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (short version). On the other hand, the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder was significantly associated with the Insomnia Severity Index and correlated with the intensity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory)."
