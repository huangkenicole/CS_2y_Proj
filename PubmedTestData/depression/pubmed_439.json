        "From a community sample, fifty-five individuals identified as having three or more symptoms of depression were asked if and where they had sought help and how they found or would find treatment. Only 20 subjects (33.9%) reported having sought professional help. No demographic differences were found between help-seekers and non-help-seekers. Eighty percent of the help-seekers had seen a mental health professional while 20% had seen a non-psychiatric physician. However, non-psychiatric physicians and friends or personal acquaintances were most frequently cited as the first point of contact for locating treatment. Results suggest that most individuals with a moderate number of depressive symptoms do not seek professional assistance but that, among those who do, a majority is eventually seen by a mental health professional. Virtually all utilize intermediaries other than mental health professionals, however, to locate assistance. The non-psychiatric physician plays a prominent role in locating help for depressed individuals, which suggests the need to educate physicians about appropriate treatment referral."
