        "The aims of this study were to develop a mobile mental health application (app) to scan the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and related factors during pregnancy; examine the effect of the app on pregnant women; and determine the factors related to using such an app.",
        "A software platform called Perinatal Anxiety Depression Monitoring Platform (PADIP) was developed. This study included 320 pregnant women: 160 in the PADIP group and 160 in the control group. The PADIP group was screened monthly for 3 months for depression, anxiety, and sleep quality, and instant feedback was provided on scale scores.",
        "During the follow-up period, there was a significant decrease in depression and anxiety scale scores in the PADIP group but no significant difference in scale scores in the control group. The interface used for the app was important for scale scores. It was preferred by pregnant women with a high education level, higher Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale scores, and lower sleep quality scores.",
        "PADIP use was associated with a decrease in depression and anxiety scores of pregnant women. It was more useful for patients with higher education levels and a history of a psychiatric disorder, but further research is needed to develop a more comprehensive model."
