        "Yoga-based practices, derived from ancient Eastern mind-body practices, have grown in popularity in the West over the past several decades. Increasing evidence supports the antidepressant effects of yoga-based interventions (YBIs). However, despite yoga's promise as a potential treatment for depression, the literature to date is marked by substantial methodological limitations, which remain a barrier to the integration of YBIs into conventional clinical care. We highlight five key areas of study that need further investigation to fill crucial gaps in the literature-base to advance yoga research and yoga's potential as an effective evidence-based treatment for depression."
