        "There are generic measures available to assess functional impairment associated with clinical conditions, but no measure has been developed to specifically evaluate consequences of differing mood disorders, our current objective. In this study, 208 participants took part in a research interview which aimed to differentiate clinical depression from non-clinical mood states. The 126 participants who met diagnostic criteria for clinical depression (i.e., bipolar disorder, melancholic depression or non-melancholic depression) were asked to judge whether they had experienced any of 24 consequences of their depressive episodes with the measure focusing on occupational, personal and interpersonal functioning. Such consequences were affirmed by 100% of participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 84% of those experiencing melancholic depression and 74% of those who had experienced a non-melancholic depressive episode. Results from a three-factor solution were consistent with the expected domains (i.e. work and relationships; self-care and daily functioning; intimate relationships and coping), and had sound goodness of fit properties. Participants with bipolar disorder were more likely to affirm each item compared to participants with unipolar depression, and participants with melancholic depression affirmed each item at a higher rate than participants who had experienced non-melancholic episodes. The new measure (the Consequences of Depression Scale; CODS) could be utilised in research and clinical activities seeking to identify and quantify the personal and economic burden of mood disorders, and provides an additional perspective for evaluating the impact of mood disorders on interpersonal, personal and occupational functioning."
