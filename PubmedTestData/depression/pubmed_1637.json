        "The purpose was to determine the short-term course of depression among dialysis patients in Saudi Arabia and identify baseline characteristics that may influence course.",
        "Thirty-nine dialysis patients in Jeddah, SA, were identified with subthreshold, minor, or major depressive disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID) and followed up at 6 and 12 weeks using the Longitudinal Interview and Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) schedule. Depressive symptoms were tracked using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Patient characteristics measured at baseline included demographic, psychosocial, physical health, and treatment factors.",
        "Of the 20 patients with major or minor depressive disorder, eight (40 %) fully remitted by 6 weeks and an additional three patients remitted over the next 6 weeks, leaving 45 % with significant depressive symptoms persisting beyond 12 weeks. Subthreshold disorders followed a similar course (42 % with persistent symptoms). Few patients received treatment for depression. Those with more education, severe health problems, poorer psychological function, more severe depressive symptoms, or a family psychiatric history were less likely to remit. Similar factors predicted change in depressive symptoms assessed by HDRS, especially high medical co-morbidity, severe illness, and overall poor psychological functioning.",
        "Nearly one-half of depressed dialysis patients in Saudi Arabia continue to have significant symptoms beyond 12 weeks of follow-up, few of whom were treated. Specific characteristics at baseline identify depressed dialysis patients at greater risk of persistent symptoms who need treatment."
