        "The purpose of this study is to examine the epidemiology of mental health conditions in incoming American Division I collegiate athletes.",
        "Pre-participation physical questionnaires from 1118 incoming student athletes at a Division I Institution were collected retrospectively from 2011-2017. Data collected included lifetime history of any mental health condition, musculoskeletal injuries, concussions, and post-concussion depression. History of any mental health condition was evaluated by gender and sport played. It was also evaluated in comparison to musculoskeletal injuries and concussions.",
        "The lifetime prevalence of any mental health condition was 14.0% for all athletes, 14.2% for male athletes, and 13.6% for female athletes. Individual sports reported a greater prevalence (17.2%) than did team sports (11.8%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). The prevalence was also higher in contact sports (16.4%) than in non-contact sports (12.5%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.072). There was a significant association between mental health condition and all four major groups of injuries examined: upper extremity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043), lower extremity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), axial skeletal (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and concussions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039). Post-concussion depression occurred in 2.0% of all athletes reporting a concussion.",
        "The lifetime prevalence of mental health conditions in this population (14.0%) is far less than estimates in the general population. This observation may be due to a combination of factors including exercise/athletic participation mitigating depressive symptoms, competitive selection, and underreporting. History of a mental health condition may be associated with injury, although causation cannot be determined."
