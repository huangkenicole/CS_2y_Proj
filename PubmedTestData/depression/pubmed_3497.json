        "Although the benefits of exercise on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are well established, longitudinal studies of objectively measured activity in clinical populations are needed to establish specific guidelines for exercise by persons with moderate-to-severe depression. This study examines the association between objectively assessed daily step count and depressive symptoms over a 24-week follow- up period in outpatients receiving treatment for moderate-to-severe depression.",
        "Participants were US Veterans with MDD enrolled in the Precision Medicine in Mental Health Care study (PRIME Care), a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized, controlled trial that examines the utility of genetic testing in the context of pharmacotherapy for MDD. Participants were a subset (N\u00a0=\u00a066) enrolled in actigraphy (using GT9X ActiGraph) monitoring component of the trial. Daily steps were examined as a predictor of depressive symptoms over 4-, 8-, 12-, 18-, and 24-weeks.",
        "On average, participants took 3,460 (\u00b11,768) steps per day. In generalized linear mixed models, an increase in 1,000 steps per day was associated with a 0.6-point decrease in depressive symptom severity at the subsequent follow-up assessment.",
        "Activity monitoring was observational and causal inferences cannot be made between daily steps and subsequent depressive symptom severity. Results may not generalize to non-treatment-seeking populations.",
        "Study findings provide an initial metric for persons with clinically significant MDD, of whom most do not get sufficient daily activity. The findings can inform future trials aimed at determining how much daily activity is needed to improve symptoms in individuals with MDD."
