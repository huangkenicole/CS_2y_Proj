        "This study aimed to determine the effect of a multimodal residential treatment program for severe adolescent anxiety, and examine whether treatment outcome was associated with pre-treatment anxiety, comorbid disorders, or participant age or gender. Participants were 70 adolescents (61.4% female, mean age\u2009=\u200915.4\u00a0years) with a primary anxiety disorder who received residential treatment involving cognitive behavioral therapy and medication management. Treatment outcome was assessed both as the change in adolescent-reported anxiety symptoms, and using treatment response criteria. Results indicated a strong effect of the intervention on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and anxiety-related life interference. Most pre-treatment variables were not associated with treatment outcome. However, higher adolescent-reported pre-treatment anxiety was associated with a greater reduction in anxiety at post-treatment, and the presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with poorer odds of treatment response. Findings indicate that residential treatment is a robust intervention for adolescent anxiety."
