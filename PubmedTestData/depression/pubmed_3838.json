        "This study aimed to examine national trends and disparities in the prevalence and treatment of adolescent 12-month major depressive episode (MDE) with co-occurring suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Publicly available data for adolescents aged 12-17 in the 2011-2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. In 2011, 4.6%, 2.1%, and 1.7% of adolescents had 12-month MDE with co-occurring suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts, and the prevalence increased steadily to 9.8%, 5.3%, and 3.5% in 2019, respectively. In 2011, 45% of adolescents with MDE and suicidal thoughts received any mental health treatment, and the prevalence increased slightly to 46.6% in 2019. Meanwhile, the prevalence of treatment use among adolescents with MDE and suicidal plans remained stable at below 54%. Lastly, the prevalence of treatment use increased significantly from 53.6% in 2011 to 60.8% in 2019 among those with MDE and suicidal attempts. Continued high prevalence and low treatment use were observed in 2020. Disparities in treatment use were found in older adolescents, adolescents without insurance, Hispanics, and Asians. Concerted efforts are needed to prioritize evidence-based interventions, enhance outreach to high-risk groups, and expand service provisions to underserved adolescents."
