      "AbstractText": [
        "Several studies have shown that patients with short sleep duration show a poor response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but such studies have not included patients with comorbid conditions. The current study was conducted to determine whether pretreatment sleep duration moderates the response of patients with major depression and insomnia disorders to a combined CBT-I and antidepressant medication treatment.",
        "This study comprised a secondary analysis of a larger randomized trial that tested combined CBT-I/antidepressant medication treatment of patients with major depression and insomnia. Participants (n = 99; 70 women; M<sub>age</sub> = 47.712.4 years) completed pretreatment polysomnography and then were randomly assigned to a 12-week treatment with antidepressant medication combined with CBT-I or a sham therapy. Short and longer sleepers were defined using total sleep time cutoffs of < 5, < 6, and < 7 hours for short sleep. Insomnia and depression remission ascertained respectively from the Insomnia Severity Index and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were used to compare treatment responses of short and longer sleepers defined by the cutoffs mentioned.",
        "Logistic regression analyses showed that statistically significant results were obtained only when the cutoff of < 5 hours of sleep was used to define \"short sleep.\" Both the CBT-I recipients with < 5 hours of sleep (odds ratio = 0.053; 95% confidence interval = 0.006-0.499) and the sham-therapy group with \u2265 5 hours of sleep (odds ratio = 0.149; 95% confidence interval = 0.045-0.493) were significantly less likely to achieve insomnia remission than were CBT-I recipients with \u2265 5 hours of sleep. The shorter sleeping CBT-I group (odds ratio = 0.118; 95% confidence interval = 0.020-0.714) and longer sleeping sham-therapy group (odds ratio = 0.321; 95% confidence interval = 0.105-0.983) were also less likely to achieve insomnia and/or depression remission than was the longer sleeping CBT-I group with \u2265 5 hours of sleep.",
        "Sleeping < 5 hours may dispose comorbid major depression/insomnia patients to a poor response to combined CBT-I/medication treatments for their insomnia and depression. Future studies to replicate these findings and explore mechanisms of treatment response seem warranted.",
