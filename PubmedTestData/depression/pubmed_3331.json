        "To examine current depressive tendencies among Japanese patients visiting a menopause clinic with complaints of climacteric symptoms.",
        "The subjects were 389 Japanese women (age range: 45-60 years; mean: 51.4 +/- 3.8 years) who visited the menopause clinic in Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keio university hospital, reporting climacteric symptoms. Their depressive tendencies were examined with the SDS (Self-rating Depression Scale, filled out by the patient).",
        "The SDS was computed to be 42.4 +/- 9.9. Ninety-three (23.9%) suffered from an intermediate or higher level depressive tendency; 132 (33.9%) had a mild depression; and 164 (42.2%) were free of any depressive tendency. It was concluded that more than one-half of the subjects suffered from some form of depression. Correlations between age, time after menopause/oophorectomy, and depressive tendency were ambiguous. In comparing the total scores of SDS for pre-, peri-, and postmenopause groups, the incidence of probable depression was higher in the second group, but no significant differences were noted among each group. When the parameters were compared in relation to their hormonal environments, the natural menopause group rated significantly higher in the scores related to sleep disturbance, hopelessness and dissatisfaction than the premenopause group. The number of those who probably exhibited mild or more exaggerated depression was significantly lower in the surgical menopause group in comparison with the natural menopause group.",
        "A depressive tendency occurred frequently among Japanese patients with menopausal disorders. It is important to evaluate the mental status of these patients with the aid of an appropriate tool."
