        "Although depression is common amongst adolescents attending general practice, little is known about factors which influence consultation. This study aims to identify factors that contribute to GP attendance in adolescents with high levels of mood symptoms.",
        "Case-control study of 13 to 17-year-olds attending (cases, N = 156) and not attending (controls, N = 120) an urban general practice during a 6-month period; questionnaires on depressive symptoms (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire), physical symptoms (Child Somatisation Inventory), socio-demographic data and attitudes were completed.",
        "Attenders had significantly more depressive and physical symptoms. In the comparison between 63 attenders and 34 non-attenders with a high level of depressive symptoms, attendance was significantly linked to lower socio-economic status, non-White ethnicity, non-intact families, and not believing that doctors are only interested in physical symptoms. On logistic regression analysis, attendance in males with depressive symptoms was predicted by more physical and less marked depressive symptoms; in females by non-White ethnicity and not believing doctors are only interested in physical symptoms.",
        "Both socio-demographic factors and adolescent attitudes influence general practitioner attendance in adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms. These findings may help inform interventions to facilitate help seeking in primary care for young people with high levels of depressive symptoms."
