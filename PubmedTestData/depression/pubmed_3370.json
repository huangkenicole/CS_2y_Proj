        "Depression is a\u00a0frequent comorbidity in chronic heart failure. It can be triggered by the experience of suffering from heart disease, but it can also play a\u00a0causal role in accelerated development and poor prognosis of heart failure.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships between heart failure and depression and the psychophysiological and behavioral mechanisms involved in this association. The effects of comorbid depression on quality of life in patients with heart failure were also examined and therapeutic options reviewed.",
        "A narrative review of the literature was undertaken.",
        "Several psychophysiological and behavioral mechanisms have been identified as mediators of the association between depression and heart failure and the adverse prognostic effects of this comorbidity. Comorbid depression leads to substantial reductions in health-related quality of life. These effects are only incompletely antagonized by exercise training and cognitive behavioral therapy. No specific effect of antidepressant medication has been demonstrated as yet in patients with heart failure.",
        "While current guidelines recommend the identification and treatment of depressive comorbidity in patients with heart failure, the available evidence provides no convincing rationale for specific treatment recommendations beyond the guideline-based treatment of heart failure itself, lifestyle interventions and patient-centered medical care. If available, psychotherapy should be offered, ideally cognitive behavioral therapy. For patients that do not improve sufficiently under outpatient treatment, the German health care system offers dedicated psychocardiological inpatient treatment programs."
