        "Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects with intravenous (IV) ketamine for major depressive disorder, with relatively less research specifically for bipolar depression. Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression.",
        "This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n\u00a0=\u00a066) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75\u2009mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures.",
        "Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a066; mean QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> total score decrease \u226550% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR<sub>16</sub> total score \u22645) was 20% after four infusions. Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment-emergent hypomania observed in only three patients (4.5%) with zero cases of mania or psychosis.",
        "Real-world effectiveness of IV ketamine for bipolar depression was observed. Repeated doses were associated with greater symptom reduction and adequate tolerability."
