        "Impaired auditory performance has been considered as marker for depression. The present study tested whether pitch perception is affected in depression and whether the impairment is task-specific or reflects global dysfunction.",
        "Twelve depressive in-patients and 12 non-depressive participants, half of the sample women, volunteered. The participants performed pitch identification using a four-choice reaction task, pitch contour perception, and pitch discrimination.",
        "During pitch identification but not during pitch contour perception or pitch discrimination, depressive patients responded less accurate than non-depressive participants (F\u2009=\u20093.3, p\u2009=\u20090.047). An analysis of covariates revealed that only female but not male depressive patients identified pitches poorly (Z\u2009=\u2009-2.2, p\u2009=\u20090.025) and inaccurate pitch identification correlated with high scores in the Beck Depression Inventory in women (r\u2009=\u2009-0.8, p\u2009=\u20090.001) but not in men (r\u2009=\u2009-0.1, p\u2009=\u20090.745). Patients did not differ from controls in reaction time or responsiveness.",
        "Impaired pitch perception in depression is task-specific. Therefore, cognitive deficits in depression are circumscribed and not global. Reduced pitch identification in depression was associated with female sex. We suggest that impaired pitch identification merits attention as a potential marker for depression in women."
