        "Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in the world population and the most frequent mental disorder in a primary health care. Unrecognized and untreated depression is associated with a poor outcome of treated chronic diseases which co-exist with depression. Depression and cardiovascular diseases are bidirectional related conditions, risks are for each other, and they often co-exist. Depression is a common disorder in cardiovascular patients with a prevalence of 20% to 45%, which is much more frequent than in the general population. In cardiac patients with acute myocardial infarction, depression occurs three times more often than in the general population. Depression has a direct effect on the pathophysiological changes of various organ systems, changing the values of blood pressure, heart rate, vasomotor tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity and plasma volume. The potential mechanism for developing heart disease in depressed patients includes hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland dysfunction, increased proinflammatory and prothrombotic factor activity, reduced omega-3 fatty acids, reduced heart rate variability, smoking, physical inactivity, reduced mood, self-esteem and self-efficacy."
