        "Creativity is a complex construct involving affective and cognitive components. Bipolar Disorder (BD) has been associated with creativity and is characterized by a wide range of affective and cognitive symptoms. Although studies of creativity in BD have tended to focus on creativity as a trait variable in medicated euthymic patients, it probably fluctuates during symptomatic states of BD. Since creativity is known to involve key affective and cognitive components, it is plausible to speculate that cognitive deficits and symptoms present in symptomatic BD could interfere with creativity.",
        "Sixty-seven BD type I patients medication free, age 18-35 years and experiencing a maniac, mixed, or depressive episodes, were assessed for creativity, executive functioning, and intelligence.",
        "Manic and mixed state patients had higher creativity scores than depressive individuals. Creativity was influenced by executive function measures only in manic patients. Intelligence did not influence creativity for any of the mood episode types.",
        "We propose that creativity in BD might be linked to the putative hyperdopaminergic state of mania and be dependent on intact executive function. Future studies should further explore the role of dopaminergic mechanisms in creativity in BD."
