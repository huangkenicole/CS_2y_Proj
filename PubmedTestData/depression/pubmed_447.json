        "Although excessive worry has been linked primarily with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), recent work suggests worry is dimensional, with potential relevance to a range of psychiatric disorders. The current study examined associations between worry and psychological symptoms across several primary diagnoses and tested worry's hypothesized unique relation to GAD in an acute psychiatric setting. Participants were 568 patients with primary diagnoses of Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder-Depressed, Bipolar Disorder-Manic, and Psychosis. Participants completed a structured diagnostic interview and questionnaires at admission. Partial correlations controlling for GAD diagnosis indicated that worry correlated with higher depression and poorer overall well-being in the Depressed, Bipolar-Depressed, and Psychosis groups and decreased functioning in the Depressed, Bipolar-Manic, and Psychosis groups. Depressed and Bipolar-Depressed groups endorsed the highest level of worry. A comorbid anxiety disorder was associated with higher worry across primary diagnoses, even after controlling for GAD. Of the anxiety disorders, GAD and Panic Disorder diagnoses predicted higher worry scores. Results discussed in terms of conceptual implications for worry as a transdiagnostic concept and clinical interventions."
