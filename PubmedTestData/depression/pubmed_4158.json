        "Research indicates that combination of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication (ADM) provides cumulative effects and thus outperforms monotherapy in treating chronic depression. In this quasi-experimental study, we explored symptom change for patients with chronic depression treated with ADM when presenting for a 12-week psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment programme. We compared outcomes through treatment and follow-up of patients who continued medication with those who discontinued. We also tested possible moderator effects of initial depression severity on change between the groups. Based on prior research, we hypothesized that combination treatment would yield better results (i.e., more reduction in depression). Patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0112) were referred from general practitioners or local secondary health care. Outcome was measured by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and comparisons were carried out using multilevel modelling. Although 35 patients discontinued ADM during treatment, 77 continued. Both continuers and discontinuers had a significant treatment effect that was maintained at 1-year follow-up. There was no difference in outcome between continuers and discontinuers of ADM. Patients with severe depression had significantly more symptom improvement than patients with moderate depression, but depression severity did not affect outcomes across continuers and discontinuers of ADM differently. The results could indicate that patients had developed resistance and/or tolerance to the prophylactic effects of medication and that ADM did not contribute to the reduction of depressive symptoms. The findings may also indicate that psychotherapy alone in some instances can be a viable alternative to continued combined treatment. Clinicians should carefully assess benefits of patients' ongoing use of antidepressant medication when entering psychotherapy."
