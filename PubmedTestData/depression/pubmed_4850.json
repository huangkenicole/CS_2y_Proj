        "To compare the therapeutic effect of 6 SSRIs among the Chinese senile depression patients. And drug-induced nausea leads to low compliance in elderly depression patients in China, it is urgent to assess the safety of 6 SSRIs with respect to induced-nausea among the Chinese senile depression patients.",
        "In the present study, a network of meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of 6 SSRIs among the Chinese senile depression patients, in addition, the safety of 6 SSRIs with respect to induced-nausea among the Chinese senile depression patients was also evaluated. PubMed, Embase databases, WanFang, CNKI, ChongqingWeiPu were searched for the related articles. The primary outcome of this study were the number of effective cases of SSRIs and the number of cases of nausea caused by SSRIs in Chinese elderly depressed patients. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals(95%CIs) were calculated within pairwise and network meta-analysis.",
        "Twenty eight trials were identified, including 2246 patients, the network meta-analysis indicated that Escitalopram was associated with a lower risk of nausea compared Paroxetine (odds ratios 0.49, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a0.34-0.69) when they were used in Chinese elderly depressed patients. Escitalopram also exhibited distinct advantages compared other SSRIs.In terms of drug efficacy, Escitalopram was significantly superior to Paroxetine (OR\u200a=\u200a2.26, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a1.55-3.37).",
        "The rank of SSRIs with respect to induced-nausea was: Combination of EP > Fluoxetine > Paroxetine > Citalopram > Sertraline > Fluvoxamine > Escitalopram, respectively."
