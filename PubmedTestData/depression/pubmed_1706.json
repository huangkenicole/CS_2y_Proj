        "Depression is a frequent complication of stroke, but few nurse researchers have studied poststroke depression (PSD). We reviewed all published research (January 1980-March 2005) that examined the incidence of and risk factors for depression among stroke survivors during the first 3 months after stroke. Many of the 49 studies reviewed were complicated by methodological limitations, including differing definitions of stroke and depression, the use of screening instruments to diagnose depression, selection bias, assessment at different time intervals poststroke, exclusion of patients with physical or cognitive impairments, and failure to control for associated variables. The incidence of PSD ranged from 5% to 63%. A history of depression, increased stroke severity, and poststroke cognitive or physical impairment were found to be risk factors for PSD."
