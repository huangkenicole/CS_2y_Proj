        "Translational research is most prominently represented by the search for biomarkers and preclinical research. Aside from generating such new measures and methodologies, translational research additionally refers to translation of integrated knowledge. This strategy involves synthesis, exchange, and dissemination of available knowledge, with the goal of improving health services and health care systems. For stress-related disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders, this strategy meets numerous challenges, as the great majority of these patients are treated by family physicians. Here, we introduce Neuropattern, a new diagnostic tool, which allows translation of psychobiological knowledge to this stress \"bedside.\" Neuropatterns are conceptualized endophenotypes of the activity and reactivity status of neurobiological interfaces, which participate in the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs under stressful conditions. Neuropattern can easily be implemented in routine clinical work, and helps the physician to individualize those therapeutic interventions that are already available."
