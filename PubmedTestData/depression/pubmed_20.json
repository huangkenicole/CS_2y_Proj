        "Major depressive disorder is characterized by changes in the emotional state, e.\u202fg. the diminished experience of positive emotions, as well as cognitive impairments such as concentration and memory difficulties. These emotional and cognitive dysfunctions are closely interrelated and play a\u00a0key role for the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. For instance, patients with depression show negatively biased information processing that affects attention and memory as well as their reaction to feedback. In addition, there is an increased motivation to avoid negatively evaluated conditions and at the same time a\u00a0reduced motivation to approach positive goals. Furthermore, depressed patients often show a\u00a0specific style of thinking, called rumination, which involves repeated, intensive thinking about the causes, consequences and symptoms of one's own negative feelings. In this review, the different relationships between emotional, motivational and cognitive symptoms of depressive patients will be presented and the influence of their interaction on cognitive performance will be discussed. The highlighted clinical relevance of emotional-cognitive dysfunctions should be considered more often in therapeutic interventions for depressed patients."
