        "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising investigational approach for treatment-resistant depression. However, reports suggesting changes in personality with DBS for movement disorders have raised clinical and ethical concerns. We prospectively examined changes in personality dimensions and antidepressant response to subcallosal cingulate (SCC)-DBS for treatment-resistant depression.",
        "Twenty-two patients with treatment-resistant depression underwent SCC-DBS. We used the NEO Five-Factor Inventory for personality assessment at baseline and every 3 months until 15 months post-DBS. We assessed depression severity monthly using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.",
        "We found a significant decrease in neuroticism (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and an increase in extraversion (<i>p</i> = 0.001) over time, showing a change toward normative data. Improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was correlated with decreases in neuroticism at 6 months (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and 12 months (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and with an increase in extraversion at 12 months (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Changes on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale over time had a significant covariate effect on neuroticism (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and extraversion (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Baseline openness and agreeableness predicted response to DBS at 6 (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and 12 months (<i>p</i> = 0.004), respectively.",
        "Limitations included a small sample size, a lack of sham control and the use of subjective personality evaluation.",
        "We observed positive personality changes following SCC-DBS, with reduced neuroticism and increased extraversion related to clinical improvement in depression, suggesting a state effect. As well, pretreatment levels of openness and agreeableness may have predicted subsequent response to DBS. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory assessment may have a role in clinical decision-making and prognostic evaluation in patients with treatment-resistant depression who undergo SCC-DBS."
