        "During the past decade the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become established as the treatment of choice for depression. As newer antidepressants become available on the market, it is important to reappraise the position of the SSRIs in the management of depression. This review will address the question: where are we going with the SSRIs? The continued establishment of the SSRIs as first-line treatment for depression will be discussed, focusing on the more rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy seen with pindolol augmentation and the use of SSRIs for treatment of depression in patients with physical illnesses, particularly ischaemic heart disease. The SSRIs have well-documented efficacy in panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and paroxetine has recently been licensed for social anxiety disorder/social phobia in some countries. Results will be presented from studies with the SSRIs in new therapeutic areas, including post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder."
