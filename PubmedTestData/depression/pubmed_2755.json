        "Adults with congenital heart disease face many potential psychosocial challenges. This review focuses on their experiences of clinically significant anxiety and depression and provides recommendations for appropriately timed referrals to mental health professionals.",
        "Adults with congenital heart disease have a higher probability of experiencing symptoms consistent with mood and anxiety disorders, yet risk factors are not well understood. Although patients as a group are often interested in psychological treatment, there is currently under-recognition and under-treatment of mental health concerns. As provider and patient awareness of the biopsychosocial implications of living with congenital heart disease continues to grow, the focus of comprehensive care is broadening to include attention to psychosocial well-being. Care teams are encouraged to create a culture that fosters open and ongoing dialog about emotional well-being, including depression and anxiety, and includes reliable processes for mental health referrals."
