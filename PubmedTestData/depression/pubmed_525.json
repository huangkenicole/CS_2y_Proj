        "To examine developments in the understanding of certain aspects of depression in diabetes mellitus patients with a special focus on diabetes distress, screening of depression and its management in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
        "Recent studies reviewed indicate an increasing trend of both major and minor depression in patients with diabetes. Depression is also reported to be persistent and chronic in diabetes patients. There is a bidirectional link between depression and diabetes. Diabetes-related distress independently increases the diabetes-related complications. Collaborative care is both applicable and helpful in managing depression in diabetes.",
        "Although a significant number of patients with diabetes suffer from depression or diabetes-related distress, majority of them remain undiagnosed and untreated. This treatment gap suggests the need for routine screening for depression and distress in patients with diabetes. Studies have confirmed that treatment focussing on diabetes may alleviate depressive symptoms. Diabetes-specific psychological interventions may prove useful in improving diabetes self-management in depressed diabetes patients. Effect of specific psychopharmacological and psychological interventions in treating depression in diabetes patients should be examined in future studies."
