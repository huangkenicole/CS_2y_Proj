        "Major depressive disorder in adolescents is closely linked to poor social, cognitive, and academic outcomes, including suicidality. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a screening tool, is one of the most widely used instruments for detecting depression; however, its diagnostic test accuracy has not yet been thoroughly examined. This study, therefore, aimed to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the BDI for detecting depression in adolescents. In August 2020, a search was conducted in the EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycArticles databases, and following a review against predefined eligibility criteria, 22 studies were finally included. The quality of the included articles was evaluated, and a hierarchical regression model was used to calculate the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity; 73.0% (95% CI; 62.0%, 81.8%) and 80.3% (72.8%, 86.1%) in cutoff 16, respectively. The findings indicated the BDI is a reliable and useful tool to screen adolescents' depression."
