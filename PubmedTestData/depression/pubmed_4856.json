        "In late-life depression (LLD), several differences between patients whose first episode is reported after age 65 (late-onset depression, LOD) and those with early-onset depression (EOD) might reflect the effects of brain ageing. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the impact of current age and age at illness onset on a number of clinical and cognitive manifestations in 438 outpatients with major depressive disorder aged >60\u2009years, treated with venlafaxine for 12\u2009weeks. When compared to the EOD group, patients with LOD were older ( P \u2009<\u20090.00001) and associated with lower depression severity ( P \u2009=\u20090.0029), lower global cognitive functioning [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): P \u2009=\u20090.0001; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status: immediate memory, P \u2009=\u20090.0009, and delayed memory, P \u2009<\u20090.00001; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System measuring executive functions: Trail-Making Test (TMT) - P \u2009=\u20090.0004 and Colour-Word Interference Test, Inhibition - P \u2009=\u20090.0063], and more dyskinesias (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale: P \u2009=\u20090.0006). After controlling for its interactions with age of onset, current age was inversely correlated with Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores at baseline ( P \u2009<\u20090.00001) and week 12 ( P \u2009=\u20090.0066), MMSE ( P \u2009<\u20090.00001), delayed memory ( P \u2009<\u20090.00001), and TMT ( P \u2009=\u20090.0021). Age of onset predicted impairment in immediate ( P \u2009=\u20090.023) and delayed memory ( P \u2009=\u20090.0181), and dyskinesias ( P \u2009=\u20090.0006). Although most features of LLD are related to ageing rather than to late-onset, LOD is a possible separate diagnostic entity characterised by memory dysfunction and increased liability to movement disorders."
