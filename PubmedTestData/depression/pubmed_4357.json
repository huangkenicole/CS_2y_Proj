        "Immigrant and refugee women have higher rates of perinatal depression compared to native-born women. Innovative telehealth interventions provide opportunities for prevention and treatment of perinatal depression. However, little is known about telehealth for perinatal immigrant and refugee women with depression. The aims of this scoping review were to identify available literature addressing the use of telehealth care for perinatal depression in immigrant and refugee women, and to determine the content, mode of delivery, and outcomes of telehealth care when provided for this population. A systematic literature search from 2000 to July 2023 was conducted in six databases and grey literature. The initial search resulted in 988 articles which were screened for their titles and abstracts. Eighty-one full-text articles were reviewed, yielding five articles included in this review. One quantitative study (a feasibility descriptive study), three qualitative studies, and a commentary supported the user satisfaction and potential effectiveness of telehealth care, delivered via telephone and text messaging, in improving perinatal depression symptoms. This review revealed a dearth of data-based studies on the outcomes of telehealth care for perinatal depression among immigrant and refugee women. Collaboration among researchers, healthcare providers, and technology engineers is required to improve telehealth care for this population."
