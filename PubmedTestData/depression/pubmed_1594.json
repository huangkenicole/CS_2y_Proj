        "Although there is some evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for treating anxiety and depression in primary care, alternative low-cost psychosocial interventions have not been investigated.",
        "The cost-effectiveness of an audio based resilience training (Positive Mental Training, PosMT) was examined using a decision model. Patient level cost and effectiveness data from a trial comparing a CCBT treatment and usual care and effectiveness data from a study on PosMT were used to inform this.",
        "Net benefits of CCBT and PosMT were approximately equal in individuals with 'moderate' depression at baseline and markedly in favour of PosMT for the 'severe' depression subgroup. With only four observations in the 'mild' depression category for PosMT, the existing evidence base remains unaltered.",
        "Efficacy data for the PosMT arm was derived from a study using a partially randomised preference design and the model structure contains simplifications due to lack of data availability.",
        "PosMT may represent good value for money in treatment of depression for certain groups of patients. More research in this area may be warranted."
