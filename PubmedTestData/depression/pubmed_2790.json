        "The Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS), a free scale, includes depression (DS) and somatic (SS) subscales. This study aimed to compare the associations of the baseline DSSS, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores with the outcome of depression over a 10-year follow-up period.",
        "Two hundred ninety outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled and were followed-up at the 6-month, 2-year, and 10-year points. The three scales were administered at each follow-up. Multiple linear regressions were used to compare the associations.",
        "In a comparison of the HAMD, DS, and HADS-depression, the HAMD and DS scores at baseline were most strongly associated with the HAMD score at two (6-month and 2-year) and one (10-year) follow-up points, respectively. In a comparison of the HAMD, DS, SS, HADS-depression, and HADS-anxiety, the SS and HAMD scores at baseline were most strongly associated with the HAMD score at two (6-month and 10-year) and one (2-year) follow-up points, respectively.",
        "The DS, SS, and HAMD scores at baseline were significantly associated with the long-term outcome of depression. Scales or subscales assessing somatic symptoms might be more strongly associated with the outcome of depression."
