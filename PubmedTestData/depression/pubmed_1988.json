        "Depression is one of the most common mental health problems which affects more than 10% of the global population. The prevalence of this disorder is higher in fibromyalgia patients. However, the influence of the combination of depression and fibromyalgia in the brain processing is poorly understood.To explore the modifications of EEG power spectrum in women with fibromyalgia when depressive feelings are elicited.Twenty eight women with fibromyalgia participated in this cross-sectional study. They were classified as women with depression or women without depression according to the score in the Geriatric Depression Scale. This questionnaire was used to elicit depression symptoms during the EEG recording. Analyses were performed with the standardized LOw Resolution Electric Tomography (sLORETA) software. Power spectrum were compared in the following frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3.Fibromyalgia patients with untreated depression showed a hypoactivation of the left hemisphere when compared with fibromyalgia patients without depression. In addition, when compared fibromyalgia patients without depression and women with both fibromyalgia and depression who were taking antidepressant medications, differences in EEG power spectrum in the studied frequency bands were not found.The current study contributes to the understanding on the influence of the combination of fibromyalgia and depression in the brain activity patterns. Patients with untreated depression showed a hypoactivation of the left hemisphere while eliciting depression symptoms. However, further research is needed, antidepressant medication might reduce the differences between patients with depression and those who do not suffer from depression symptoms."
