      "AbstractText": [
        "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment shown to be effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the effect of rTMS therapy on functional connectivity within the brains of patients being treated for MDD remains poorly understood. Few studies have investigated the effects of a course of rTMS on resting-state network activity.",
        "In an open-label naturalistic study, resting-state fMRI was collected prior to and following a four-week course of rTMS in 24 participants with MDD and 2 with bipolar disorder. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores showed a response rate of 42%.",
        "Clinical response to rTMS was correlated with reduced functional connectivity from baseline to post-rTMS within the salience network (SN). This indicates SN connectivity may be functionally relevant to how rTMS produces antidepressant effects. In an exploratory inter-network analysis, connectivity between the SN and posterior default mode network (pDMN) was higher following treatment. However this difference was not correlated with the antidepressant response. Local BOLD activity within these networks was also assessed using the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) technique. Local activity increased in both the SN and pDMN following rTMS. However this increase was also not correlated with antidepressant response.",
        "The sample population was heterogeneous, continuing current use of medications, and the study lacked a healthy control or sham stimulation comparison group.",
        "Together, these results provide evidence for the involvement of the SN in the antidepressant response to rTMS treatment."
