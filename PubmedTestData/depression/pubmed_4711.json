        "Although depression is a treatable cause of suffering, disability and death, its identifcation and treatment continue to be a challenge in clinical practice and a severe problem for global public health. The main objective of this study was to investigate the frequency with which mental health professionals use scales to assess depressive patients in Argentina and to determine the reasons that constrain such practice. Between July and September 2012 a national survey was conducted by e-mail. Professionals registered in the database of the Argentine Association of Psychiatrists were invited to participate in the survey. Responses were obtained from 243 professionals. Of the total respondents, only 8.7% said they always used scales to assess depressive patients. The reasons recorded by most respondents why scales were not used were: lack of time and the belief that they do not help in clinical practice. Despite the fact that treatment guidelines for depression recommend the use of scales to optimize the assessment and treatment of depressive disorders, this does not seem to be the usual behavior in clinical practice in our country."
