        "Adolescent depression is linked to adult ill-health and functional impairment, but recent research suggests that individual/contextual factors might account for this association. This study aimed to test whether the clinical heterogeneity of adolescent depression is related to marginalization from the labor market across early to middle adulthood. Data were drawn from the Uppsala Longitudinal Adolescent Depression Study, a community-based cohort initially assessed with structured clinical interviews at age 16-17. The cohort (n\u2009=\u2009321 depressed; n\u2009=\u2009218 nondepressed) was followed up after 2+\u2009decades through linkage to nationwide population-based registries. Outcomes included consecutive annual data on unemployment, work disability, social welfare recipiency, and a composite marginalization measure, spanning from age 21 to 40. Longitudinal associations were examined using logistic regression analysis in a generalized estimating equations modeling framework. Subsequent depressive episodes and educational attainment in early adulthood were explored as potential pathways. The results showed that adolescent depression was associated with adult marginalization outcomes, but the strength of association varied across depressed subgroups. Adolescents with persistent depressive disorder had higher odds of all outcomes, including the composite marginalization measure (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.0, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.4-2.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and this was partially (31%) mediated by subsequent depressive episodes in early adulthood. Exploratory moderation analysis revealed that entry into tertiary education mitigated the association with later marginalization, but only for adolescents with episodic major depression. In conclusion, the risk for future labor market marginalization is elevated among depressed adolescents, particularly those presenting with persistent depressive disorder. Targeted interventions seem crucial to mitigate the long-lasting impact of early-onset depression."
