        "Studies have reported the detrimental effects of depression following spine surgery; however, none have evaluated whether preoperative depression screening in patients with a history of depression is protective from adverse outcomes and lowers health care costs. We studied whether depression screenings/psychotherapy visits within 3 months before 1- to 2-level lumbar fusion were associated with lower medical complications, emergency department utilization, readmissions, and health care costs.",
        "The PearlDiver database from 2010 to 2020 was queried for depressive disorder (DD) patients undergoing primary 1- to 2-level lumbar fusion. Two cohorts were 1:5 ratio matched and included DD patients with (n\u00a0= 2,622) and DD patients without (n\u00a0= 13,058) a preoperative depression screen/psychotherapy visit within 3 months of lumbar fusion. A 90-day surveillance period was used to compare outcomes. Logistic regression models computed odds ratio (OR) of complications and readmissions. P value < 0.003 was significant.",
        "DD patients without depression screening had significantly greater incidence and odds of experiencing medical complications (40.57% vs. 16.00%; OR 2.71, P < 0.0001). Rates of emergency department utilization were increased in patients without screening versus screening (15.78% vs. 4.23%; OR 4.25, P < 0.0001), despite no difference in readmissions (9.31% vs. 9.53%; OR 0.97, P\u00a0= 0.721). Finally, 90-day reimbursements ($51,160 vs. $54,731) were significantly lower in the screened cohort (all P < 0.0001).",
        "Patients who underwent a preoperative depression screening within 3 months of lumbar fusion had decreased medical complications, emergency department utilization, and health care costs. Spine surgeons may use these data to counsel their patients with depression before surgical intervention."
