      "AbstractText": [
        "Maternal and paternal perinatal depression and anxiety are theorised to adversely impact infant development. Yet, few studies have assessed both mental health symptoms and clinical diagnoses within the one study. Moreover, research on fathers is limited. This study therefore aimed to examine the association between symptoms and diagnoses of maternal and paternal perinatal depression and anxiety with infant development.",
        "Data were from the Triple B Pregnancy Cohort Study. Participants included 1539 mothers and 793 partners. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in trimester three. Infant development was assessed at 12-months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development.",
        "Antepartum, maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with poorer infant social-emotional (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.11, p\u00a0=\u00a0.025) and language development (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.16, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001). At 8-weeks postpartum, maternal anxiety symptoms were associated with poorer overall development (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.11, p\u00a0=\u00a0.030). No association was observed for clinical diagnoses in mothers, nor paternal depressive and anxiety symptoms or clinical diagnoses; albeit risk estimates were largely in the expected direction of adverse effects on infant development.",
        "Evidence suggests that maternal perinatal depression and anxiety symptoms may adversely impact infant development. Effects were small but findings underscore the importance of prevention, early screening and intervention, alongside consideration of other risk factors during early critical periods."
