        "Researchers are increasingly investigating therapeutic response associated with new patient subgroups as a way to improve electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment outcomes and reduce adverse events. This study is the first to examine baseline cognitive impairment status as a predictor of clinical outcome in first acute-course ECT patients.",
        "Baseline cognitive function at various thresholds and serial depressive symptom severity data from first-time ECT patients were examined using generalized linear mixed-effects models.",
        "Of 1345 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 617 had available data at their third assessment visit (~15th treatment visit). There was a robust improvement in depression symptoms over time (P < 0.0001), and cognitive function was not associated with baseline levels of depressive symptoms or serially measured change in self-reported symptom severity during acute-phase ECT.",
        "These results indicate that an acute course of ECT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe depression benefits patients with or without accompanying baseline cognitive impairment. These findings may be useful in informing shared decision-making discussions about ECT risks and expected benefits."
