        "2007 marks a shift in scientific literature on the cognitive vulnerabilities of depression. Preceded by a vast amount of studies exploring neuroplasticity and cognitive transfer effects, Siegle e.a. (Cognit Ther Res 2007; 31: 235-62) published the findings of a proof-of-principle study in which cognitive control training (cct) was applied to treat depression. This denotes an evolution towards clinically oriented cct studies targeting reduction of the vulnerability mechanisms of depression. Following this publication, several studies tested the effects of cct on emotional vulnerability. These studies show great variability. <br/> AIM: This article provides an overview summarizing the findings of cct for depression published in the last 10 years.<br/> METHOD: The results of a recently conducted systematic review were reviewed, with a particular interest in clinical implications and challenges.<br/> RESULTS: cct shows beneficial effects on indicators of depression vulnerability (e.g., stress reactivity, rumination, symptomatology). Associated literature underlines the importance of intensive training procedures, use of an affective task context and task motivation.<br/> CONCLUSION: cct shows potential as a clinical intervention for depression. However, several questions still need to be addressed before implementation into clinical practice is warranted."
