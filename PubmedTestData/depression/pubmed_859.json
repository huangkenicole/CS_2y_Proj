        "Debate is ongoing as to whether burnout can be differentiated from depression. This study evaluated whether burnout and depression could be distinguished using a new burnout measure and other variables.",
        "Scores on the Sydney Burnout Measure (SBM) were compared between participants with self-diagnosed burnout (BO-all group; n\u00a0=\u00a0622) and clinically-diagnosed depression (DEP-all group; n\u00a0=\u00a090). The latter group was split into melancholic (DEP-mel; n\u00a0=\u00a056) and non-melancholic (DEP-nonmel; n\u00a0=\u00a034) depression subgroups for subsequent analyses. Differences in reporting of depressive symptoms and causal attributions were also evaluated.",
        "While total SBM scores showed poor differentiation, the BO-all group had lower social withdrawal and higher empathy loss subscale scores than the depression groups. Odds ratios were significant for several of the depressive symptoms and causal attribution items when comparing the BO-all group to the DEP-all and DEP-mel groups, while only a few items were significant when comparing the BO-all and DEP-nonmel groups.",
        "Participants in the depression group were assigned by clinician-based depression diagnoses, rather than by a standardised diagnostic interview, and the group had a relatively small sample size. Participants in the burnout group were self-diagnosed and not assessed for comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.",
        "There were some nuanced symptoms differences between burnout and depression, but many of the SBM symptoms were not specific to burnout. Results also suggested that burnout overlaps more with non-melancholic than melancholic depression, and that differentiation of burnout and depression may rely more on weighting causal factors over symptoms."
