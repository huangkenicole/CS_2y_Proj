        "Major depressive disorder and other related disturbances in mood account for the highest proportion of psychiatric illnesses in the general population and are a leading cause of disability around the world. Despite belief to the contrary, athletes are vulnerable to the same mental illnesses as the general population. Unique circumstances experienced by athletes create challenges that are exclusive to that population, which can place them at greater risk for depression and other mental illnesses. This chapter explores the incidence of depression and related mood disturbances in athletes, risk factors for illness, obstacles to assessment and management, and treatment strategies."
