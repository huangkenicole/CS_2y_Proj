      "AbstractText": [
        "Depression is one of the most common mental disorders worldwide. The German National Disease Management Guideline on Unipolar Depression (NDGM), (Nationale Versorgungsleitlinie, NVL), updated in 2022, contains recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic depressive disorders.",
        "The update was based on the findings of a systematic review of the evidence (2013-2022) and was issued by a multidisciplinary panel after a formalized consensus process.",
        "The structure of the guideline was fundamentally revised and is now based on the phases of depression and/or its treatment, as well as on the severity of the disease. There is newly added material with recommendations on Internet- and mobile-device based treatments, esketamine, repetitive magnetic stimulation, psychosocial therapies, rehabilitation, social participation, and complex forms of care. The guideline also emphasizes better coordination of all services in the care of patients with depression. This article covers the most important changes and additions among the 156 recommendations in the guideline. More information and accompanying materials are available at www.leitlinien.de/depression.",
        "There are effective treatments for depression and a variety of supportive measures that can be applied with great benefit by primary care physicians, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and complementary care providers. The updated guideline aims to further improve the early detection, definitive diagnosis, treatment, and interdisciplinary care of people with depression."
