      "AbstractText": [
        "The ZERSSEN Mood Scale or \" Befindlichkeits-Skala \" is the only self-rating scale that is altogether specific (adjectives on mood states essentially), actual and therefore sensitive (lack of adjectives on the habitual state, on personality traits), bipolar (possible detection of a manic or depressive shift), easy to administrate and analyze, existing under 2 statistically equivalent forms. Each BS and BS' form contains 28 pairs of antonymic everyday adjectives, whose French translation has been checked by back-translation. The subject has to cross if he feels right now \" rather... \", \" rather... \" or \" neither nor \". The French translation was tested on 100 depressed and 6 manic newly hospitalized patients, on 30 depressed patients in the course of a 6-week antidepressant trial, and on 46 academic and administrative members of the staff. Various calculations on the validity, reliability and sensitivity of the scale confirm the original German data. The product-moment correlation between BS and BS' (split-half reliability) reaches .89 in the control group, .79 in the newly hospitalized depressives and .93 to .96 in the anti-depressant trial, a p less than .001 in all three studies. The correlation does not reach a significant level in neurotic depressives, who are a mean 11 y. younger than psychotic depressives and score significantly lower than the latter. Age, sex and sequence of administration do not influence the means, the standard deviations and the correlation between BS and BS'. The original German studies and our original French ones give convergent results as for means and extreme scores of the main mood levels, with a cutting score for mania at 6 and for depression at 27 : (see article) Thanks to their high intercorrelation, the BS and BS' scales may be given independently, thus allowing a daily or even twice daily administration. The range of application of the ZERSSEN Mood Scale is not limited to psychiatry but includes numerous medical, surgical and psychological fields."
