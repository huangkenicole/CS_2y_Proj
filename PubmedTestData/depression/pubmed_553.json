        "Geriatrics is pleased to highlight the clinical implications of research topics supported by the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR). AFAR is a leading private organization supporting research on the aging process and diseases of older populations. More than 900 physicians, scientists, and students have received AFAR grants totaling more than $20 million since AFAR was founded by Irving S. Wright, MD, in 1981. The articles in the New Frontiers series are designed to provide primary care physicians with insight into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the diseases of aging."
