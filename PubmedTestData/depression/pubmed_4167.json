        "This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of depression following the April 2020 flooding in Fort McMurray.",
        "A cross-sectional study design. Questionnaires were self-administered through an anonymous, online survey. Data collected included sociodemographics, flooding-related variables, clinical information, and likely major depressive disorder (MDD) using PHQ-9 scoring. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, and logistic regression at <i>P</i> = < 0.05.",
        "Of the 186 respondents who completed the survey, 85.5% (159) of the respondents were females, 14.5% (27) were males, 52.7% (98) were above 40 years of age, and 94% (175) were employed. The prevalence of mild to severe depression among the respondents was 53.7% (75). Respondents who reported that they are unemployed are 12 times more likely to have a moderate to severe depression (OR = 12.16; 95% CI: 1.08-136.26). Respondents who had previously received a mental health diagnosis of MDD are five times more likely to have moderate to severe depression (OR = 5.306; 95% CI: 1.84-15.27).",
        "This study suggests that flooding could impact the psychosocial and mental health of affected people. There is a need to reassess the existing guidelines on emergency planning for flooding to reduce its impacts on mental health and identify where research can support future evidence-based guidelines."
