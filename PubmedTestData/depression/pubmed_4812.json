        "Evidence on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for people receiving chronic hemodialysis has been rather scarce in the literature. We report the case of a 74-year-old male patient with major depressive disorder on chronic hemodialysis for 14 years with numerous physical complications including abdominal aortic aneurysm, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and cerebral stroke. Several antidepressant drugs failed to improve the patient, but judicious implementation of a total of 6 ECT sessions under a close liaison with medical experts brought him into remission without any notable adverse effects. In particular, flumazenil, as well as rocuronium and sugammadex, was used together with a strict control of blood pressure. We thoroughly discuss the case and provide a literature review on such topics as assessment of physical complications, medications used for anesthesia, electrode placement, and timing of hemodialysis during ECT sessions, which identified a clear need for more research on this medically challenging issue."
