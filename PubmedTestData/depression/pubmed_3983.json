        "Older adults are at risk of chronic, silent depressive changes and the vulnerability of older adults in urban slums of India is rarely exposed. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of depression among the older adults in the urban slums of India and to study the factors associated with it.",
        "This was a community based analytical cross-sectional study conducted in Urban Field Practice Area of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Chhattisgarh, India among older adults more than or equal to 60\u00a0years of age selected using two stage, simple random sampling. The data was collected in a sample of 400 older adults by face-to-face interview using self-designed, semi-structured and pretested proforma that included validated Hindi version of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and analyzed using SPSS v23.",
        "The prevalence of depression among older adults was 51.5% in the present study; with 27%, 12.8% and 11.8% having mild, moderate and severe depression respectively. Number of family members, living status of spouse, emotional attachment to family members, conflict in family, loneliness, social isolation, marginal friendship ties, functional status, physical exercise, active complains and diastolic BP were independent predictors of depression in older adults.",
        "Early identification of depression in older adults using GDS-15 and incorporation of social isolation and functionality assessment routinely by healthcare providers for all older adults attending the outpatient departments is the need of the hour. A holistic approach to care of older adults is vital as healthcare providers seek to understand the impact of multiple, complex, interconnected factors on overall health and well-being of older adults."
