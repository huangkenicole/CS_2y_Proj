        "Boarding Quran courses are religious institutions where course attendees spend large part of the year. Depression is an ever-increasing health problem. So, it is worth to study on the effects of religion concept and religious belief and behaviours' that religion concept brings, on depression. The main purpose of this study, is to analyse the effect of religious attitudes and behaviours on depression in Quran course / hafiz students.",
        "The study is a cross sectional, case-control survey research. Boarding Quran courses and high schools were visited in Samsun city. A total of 956 participants enrolled between June 2015 and December 2015 were included into study from Samsun city of Turkey. Volunteers, 13 years and over ones without any psychiatric disorders were included in the study. Religious attitude-behaviour inventory and Beck's depression inventory were used in the study.",
        "Median point of case group attitude scale was 49, control group's was 57 and difference among both has a statistical meaning (p<0.001). Beck's depression score average of case group is 12.93\u00b19.33, its control group's average is 13.74\u00b111.14 and difference between them is not important. Median score of both groups are 11. When scores of attitude and depression scales compared with each other in terms of demographic parameters, there is a difference among group, gender, age and education parameters (p<0.001).",
        "It was seen that religious attitudes and behaviours can be protective for boarding Quran course students but it cannot be enough by itself."
