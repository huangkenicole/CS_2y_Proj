        "Depression is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder. This study aims to determine whether depression with atypical features shows different heritability and different degree of overlap with polygenic risk for psychiatric and immuno-metabolic traits than other depression subgroups.",
        "Data included 30 069 European ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank who met criteria for lifetime major depression. Participants reporting both weight gain and hypersomnia were classified as \u2191WS depression (N = 1854) and the others as non-\u2191WS depression (N = 28 215). Cases with non-\u2191WS depression were further classified as \u2193WS depression (i.e. weight loss and insomnia; N = 10 142). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 22 traits were generated using genome-wide summary statistics (Bonferroni corrected p = 2.1 \u00d7 10-4). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of depression subgroups was estimated.",
        "\u2191WS depression had a higher polygenic risk for BMI [OR = 1.20 (1.15-1.26), p = 2.37 \u00d7 10-14] and C-reactive protein [OR = 1.11 (1.06-1.17), p = 8.86 \u00d7 10-06] v. non-\u2191WS depression and \u2193WS depression. Leptin PRS was close to the significance threshold (p = 2.99 \u00d7 10-04), but the effect disappeared when considering GWAS summary statistics of leptin adjusted for BMI. PRS for daily alcohol use was inversely associated with \u2191WS depression [OR = 0.88 (0.83-0.93), p = 1.04 \u00d7 10-05] v. non-\u2191WS depression. SNP-based heritability was not significantly different between \u2191WS depression and \u2193WS depression (14.3% and 12.2%, respectively).",
        "\u2191WS depression shows evidence of distinct genetic predisposition to immune-metabolic traits and alcohol consumption. These genetic signals suggest that biological targets including immune-cardio-metabolic pathways may be relevant to therapies in individuals with \u2191WS depression."
