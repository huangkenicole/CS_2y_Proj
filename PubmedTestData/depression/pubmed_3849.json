        "We aimed to assess cross-cultural differences in depressive symptoms and the validity of the Korean version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Four hundred and sixty-four children and adolescents (aged 7-19, 278 girls) with any psychiatric diagnosis, 290 of whom had major depressive disorder, were included. The levels of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents were evaluated by children/adolescents and their parents. We conducted Pearson's r and Cronbach's \u03b1, confirmative factor analysis and item response theory tests. The Korean version of the MFQ demonstrated excellent criterion validity and discriminant validity. There were no cultural differences in the clinical manifestations of depression in youth from Western countries and Korea. Korean youths with depression were more likely to complain of cognitive and emotional symptoms than somatic symptoms. The Korean version of the MFQ demonstrated promising psychometric properties in a clinical sample of children and adolescents."
