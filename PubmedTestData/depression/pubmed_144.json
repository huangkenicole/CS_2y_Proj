      "AbstractText": [
        "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has appeared as a new non-invasive antidepressant method, which implies non-convulsive focal stimulation of the brain through a time-varying magnetic field. Research indicates, that rTMS of the prefrontal cortex has a significant antidepressant effect and is associated with minimal side effects. The method has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in USA and a couple of other countries for the treatment of drug-resistant depressions. The present status on the issue confirms the outcome of previous research and recommends the method as an additional option in the treatment of depression."
