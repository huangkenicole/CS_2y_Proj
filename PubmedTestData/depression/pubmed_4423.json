        "Chronic lower back pain induced by lumbar disc degeneration or herniation exerts a great impact on patients' daily lives. Depression and anxiety often exist among patients with lower back pain. Some studies mentioned about mechanisms, such as inflammatory biomarkers, which are commonly seen in herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Our study used a large database from the National Health Insurance to explore the incidence rate of MDD in patients with HIVD and correlated risk factors. A total of 41,874 patients with HIVD were included in this work. The control group was matched by using propensity scores. Results: The results showed a temporal association between prior HIVD and subsequent MDD after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Patients with HIVD were at high risk of developing MDD (hazard ratio, HR: 9.00, 95% confidence interval, CI: 7.196-11.257) even after adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities (HR: 8.47, 95% CI: 6.84-10.49, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Conclusions: The combination of HIVD and MDD represents an important health problem that is associated with higher disability rates, socioeconomic disadvantage, and greater utilization of health care resources. Early detection and combined treatment of depressive symptoms may benefit patients with HIVD."
