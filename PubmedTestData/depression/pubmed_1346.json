        "Risk factors and comorbidities associated with depression vary with age and must be considered when selecting appropriate anti-depressant medication for patients. Studies are lacking which focus both on treatments prescribed and include a broad age spectrum. The goal of this study was to investigate whether age of patients at diagnosis impact the type of antidepressant drug class prescribed.",
        "This retrospective cohort study based on the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) included 138,097 patients with depression followed in 1188 general practices from date of first depression diagnosis given between 2015 and 2018 (index date). Patients aged 18-30, 31-65 and\u00a0>\u00a065 were compared in homogeneous groups based on gender and insurance type. Odds ratios adjusted by gender, insurance type, treatment site and Charlson-Comorbidity-Index were used to assess the difference in probability of receiving prescription for antidepressant drug classes as well as individual treatment drugs by age group.",
        "The cohort included 13,553 (9.8%), 82,524 (59.8%) and 42,020 (30.4%) patients aged 18-30 years (young), 31-65 years (middle-aged) and >65 years (older). Less than half of patients received anti-depressant medication, with 4717 (34.8%) aged 18-30, 35,014 (42.4%) aged 31-65, and 20,294 (48.3%) aged 65 or older receiving at least one anti-depressant medication. Tri- and tetra-cyclic mediations were prescribed to 65.8% of patients aged >65, and 59.0% of patients aged 31-65. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) were prescribed to 55.5% of patients. Older patients showed an increased probability (OR: 1.3 [1.26-1.34 95% CI], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) for tri- and tetra-cyclic medication, while younger patients showed an increased probability for SSRIs and SNRIs (OR: 1.23 [1.16-1.30 95% CI], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).",
        "Age-related differences in anti-depressant medication prescription were shown, with older patients above 65 years predominantly receiving tri- and tetra-cyclic medication, while younger patients aged 18-30 received SSRIs more frequently. Further studies with homogeneous groups relating to comorbidity profile and disease severity are needed to fully understand age effects on treatment patterns."
