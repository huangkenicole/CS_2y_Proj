        "Depression often goes undetected and untreated in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). To investigate whether patients with CHF show a specific profile of depression symptoms, we compared depression symptoms in depressed patients with and without CHF.",
        "Of a total of 921 patients from a CHF and a psychosomatic outpatient clinic, 137 met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and 113 for other depressive disorders. Depressed patients with CHF (n=113) and without CHF (n=137) were compared with respect to severity of individual DSM-IV depressive symptoms, as measured with the PHQ-9. To stratify for depression severity, ANCOVAs with sociodemographic characteristics as covariates were performed separately for patients with major depressive disorder and other depressive disorders.",
        "Among the patients meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder, patients with CHF reported significantly lower levels of depressed mood (p=.006) and worthlessness/guilt (p=.019) than patients without CHF. In contrast, no significant group differences were found for any of the other depression symptoms. Group comparisons among the patients with other depressive disorders completely replicated these results (p< or =.001, and p=.04, respectively).",
        "Our study population of CHF patients may not be representative for CHF patients recruited in the general population.",
        "The diagnostic features discriminating between depressed patients with and without CHF are the cognitive-emotional symptoms of depression, not the somatic symptoms. This finding may partially explain the low recognition rate of depression in patients with CHF. The different profile of depression symptoms in patients with and without CHF should be considered in diagnosis, treatment and medical education."
