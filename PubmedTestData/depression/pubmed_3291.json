        "It has been reported that stress can induce depression, with the patient's age and sex as moderating factors. Associations between depression and lifestyle in Korean adults have not been addressed. This study was designed to examine if the relationships among stress, problem drinking, exercise, and depression differ by age and sex. For this study, the Korea health panel data was utilized, and a structural equation model using AMOS was employed. The major findings were as follows: women were more likely to experience stress and depression than men. Individuals over 40 showed a higher tendency toward stress and depression than those under 40. Age- and sex-specific paths from stress to problem drinking, exercise, and depression were positively inter-correlated; the path from exercise to depression indicated an inverse association. These results indicate the need for evidence-based stress-management programs for the psychological well-being of Korean adults."
