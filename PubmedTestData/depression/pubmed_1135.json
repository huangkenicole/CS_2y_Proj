        "Recent preclinical data have raised the possibility that prepubertal treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with stimulant medication might increase risk for later depression. The current longitudinal study investigated whether children with ADHD who were treated with stimulant medication displayed heightened levels of adolescent depression. Adolescents diagnosed with ADHD during childhood who had received a minimum of 1 year of treatment with stimulant medication were compared to adolescents with a childhood history of ADHD who were never treated with stimulants and a demographically matched comparison group on self-reports of depressive symptoms and diagnoses of depressive disorders. Both subgroups with childhood ADHD reported significantly higher dimensional ratings of depression and categorical rates of depressive disorders relative to the comparison group (all p<0.05), yet those who were and were not medicated did not differ from one another. Results indicate that, while childhood ADHD increases risk for adolescent depression, stimulant treatment for ADHD neither heightens nor protects against such risk."
