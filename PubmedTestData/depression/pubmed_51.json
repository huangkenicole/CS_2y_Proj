        "Depression in childhood and adolescence creates significant burden to individuals, families, and societies by increasing morbidity, increasing mortality, and negatively affecting quality of life during times of significantly depressed mood. Several studies have estimated the cost of depression in the United States and elsewhere, but none have included the costs associated with depression in children or younger adolescents. This paper reviews data currently available on the cost of depression in childhood and the cost effectiveness of interventions to treat and prevent depression in this population.",
        "A systematic review was conducted of published literature related to the cost of depression in children and adolescents and of economic evaluations of interventions to treat or prevent depression in this population.",
        "Five articles were identified that included any type of data related to the cost of depression in childhood; four articles were identified that conducted economic evaluations of interventions to treat or prevent depression in children or adolescents.",
        "Little information on the economic burden of depression in childhood is currently available. Future research in this area needs to include a broad range of costs; long-term outcomes; and costs relevant to decision makers in public and private agencies, such as implementation costs and costs of sustaining intervention fidelity over time."
