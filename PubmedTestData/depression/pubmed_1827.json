        "To clarify strengths for promoting the recovery process among older adults with depression in Japan.",
        "With the ageing of the global population, care and treatment of older adults with depression has been attracting increased attention around the world. It has become clear that the inner strength is inversely related to depression in older adults and that the use of inner strength is becoming a key concept in the context of caring for older adults with depression.",
        "Qualitative descriptive design.",
        "Participant observation and narrative interviews were conducted individually with 12 older adults with depression in care-based and daily life settings. The data obtained were subjected to thematic analysis using the narrative method to extract themes and subthemes.",
        "A total of three themes and 12 subthemes were elucidated. Strengths found to promote the recovery process in older adults with depression were (i) a sense of emotional connection, (ii) dialogue with life and (iii) discovery.",
        "Strengths promoting the recovery process from a whole-person perspective were clarified by conceptualising the experiences of older adults with depression with a strength orientation. A sense of emotional connection constituted a basis for promoting the recovery process. Dialogue with life and discovery were thought to represent the wisdom and spirituality found in the experience of old age and depression.",
        "While regarding the results of this study as basic knowledge, focusing on subjects' individual narratives of illness and recovery will open the possibility of a strength-oriented nursing practice for older adults with depression and lead to the provision of care that promotes recovery."
