        "Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel investigational brain stimulation modality for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MST is a potential alternative seizure-based treatment to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), given that it may offer equivalent antidepressant efficacy, yet with a relative sparing of cognitive functioning. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a marker of central autonomic functioning. We aimed to explore the relationships among baseline HRV, age, clinical outcome, and executive function following MST, in patients with TRD.",
        "Eighty-eight TRD patients (55 females; 18-70\u2009years) were enrolled and 48 patients completed a course of MST in an open-label study. Patients received MST treatments two to three times per week, using one of three stimulation frequencies (ie, 100\u2009Hz, 50 Hz, or 25 Hz) at 100% stimulator output. Root mean square of the successive R-R differences (RMSSD), an index of HRV, was computed from a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D<sub>24</sub>) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS<sub>16</sub>). Executive function was assessed using the Trail Making Test and the Mazes Test from the MATRICS battery.",
        "Baseline RMSSD was correlated with baseline HAM-D<sub>24</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.340, p\u00a0= 0.001) and baseline Mazes Test (r\u00a0= 0.417, p\u00a0= 0.0007) but not with baseline Trail Making Test. Furthermore, baseline RMSSD was not correlated with changes on the HAM-D<sub>24</sub>, QIDS<sub>16</sub>, or total scores on the Trail Making Test. However, there was a significant correlation between baseline RMSSD and improvement on the Mazes Test following MST (r\u00a0= 0.502, p\u00a0= 0.0004).",
        "Since this is an open-label trial, the influence of the placebo effect cannot be excluded. However, our results suggest that baseline RMSSD may be a state-biomarker of depression and executive function impairment. Additionally, while baseline vagally mediated resting cardiac activity did not predict the outcome of depression, it may mediate executive function improvements following MST."
