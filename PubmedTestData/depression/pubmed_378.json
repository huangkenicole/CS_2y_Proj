        "Of 374 unselected primary care patients assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale, 11.8 per cent rated themselves as suffering from anxiety, and 3.7 per cent as depressed. Clinically, 8 per cent were diagnosed as cases of anxiety, and 4 per cent as cases of depression, but agreement was very poor between these cases and those elicited with the HAD scale, only 25 per cent of the latter being identified by the primary care physicians. One third of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of anxiety and 47 per cent of those with diagnosed depression were offered appropriate treatment, usually medication with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and consultation with a medical social worker. The results were consistent with the expected prevalences, thus indicating anxiety and depression to be markedly under-diagnosed and under-treated, and suggest that there is a manifest need of consultation facilities and of further education among primary care physicians."
