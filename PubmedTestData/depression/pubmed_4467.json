        "The recent network perspective of depression conceptualizes depression as a dynamic network of causally related symptoms, that contrasts with the traditional view of depression as a discrete latent entity that causes all symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for severe depression, but little is known about the temporal trajectories of symptom improvement during a course of ECT.",
        "To gain insight into the dynamics of depressive symptoms in individuals treated with ECT.",
        "The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) was used to assess symptoms twice a week in 68 participants with a unipolar or bipolar depression treated with ECT, with an average of 12 assessments per participant. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was used to analyze individual time series data, which were subsequently aggregated to calculate a directed symptom network and the in- and out-strength for each symptom.",
        "Participants had a mean age of 49.6 (SD\u00a0=\u00a012.8) and 60% were female. Somatic symptoms (e.g., decreased weight) and suicidal ideation showed the highest out-strength values, indicating that their improvement tended to precede improvements in mood symptoms, which showed high in-strength. Sad mood had the highest in-strength, and thus appeared to be the last symptom to improve during ECT treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "This study addresses a gap in the existing literature on ECT, by first analysing the temporal trajectories of symptoms within individual patients and subsequently aggregating them to the group level. The results show that somatic symptoms tend to improve before mood symptoms during ECT."
