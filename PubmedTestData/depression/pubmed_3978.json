        "The aim: To study the influence of anxiety and depressive disorders on life quality of patients with arterial hypertension.",
        "Materials and methods: 55 patients with arterial hypertension (AH) of 2nd stage were examined to reach the goal. Age diapason was 25-73 years, the middle age was 53.56+10.28. There were 58.2% (32) of women and 41.8% (23) of men among the patients.",
        "Results: Results analysis of the investigation of patients with arterial hypertension and anxiety and depressive disorders using the Spielberger-Khanin anxiety inventory showed moderate (30.9%) and high (69.1%) level of trait anxiety. As for the state anxiety the high level of it was confirmed in 74.6% of studied patients and moderate level of state anxiety in 25.5% of patients. During the analysis of gender-based distribution the trait anxiety level was significantly higher in women (p<0.05). Results of PHQ-9 showed subclinical depression level (12.7%), mild (49.1%) and moderate (16.4%). Moderate manifestations of depression were found in 12.7%, severe depression in 9.1% (5 individuals). As for the gender-based distribution, anxiety indicators were significantly higher in women (p<0.01). HADS method did not show significant difference of depression levels of gender-based distribution.",
        "Conclusions: The majority of individuals with arterial hypertension and nonpsychotic mental disorders have a high level of trait and state anxiety. Direct correlation was found between the trait anxiety indicator and depression severity, which were defined according to HADS and PHQ-9 questionnaires. The level of anxiety and depressive episode severity were found to be reliably higher in women in gender-based distribution, that/which was accompanied by decrease in most of the life quality indicators."
