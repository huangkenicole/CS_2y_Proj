        "The aetiology of reported side effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is unclear. We examined the interaction of depression and age on adverse neuropsychological and putative side effects of ECT.",
        "Inpatients (N=81; median age 70 years) with major depression were assessed prospectively pre-ECT, immediately post-ECT and 1-3 years later. Patients were administered the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) and neuropsychological tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale. Side effects and total burden scores were rated pre- and post-treatment.",
        "HRSD and GAF scores improved with treatment after ECT, but the prevalence and total burden of side effects were unchanged. Side effect burden was related to depression level before and after ECT. Improvement in depression correlated with reduction in side effect burden. There was a significant decline in side effect burden after controlling for change in depression. Patients' scores on neuropsychological measures did not appear to change after ECT or between pre-ECT and follow-up. Re-analysis, allowing for age, chronicity of depression, medication use and development of dementia, did not alter the findings.",
        "lack of a control group, lack of information on ECT technique, incomplete data sets and limited neuropsychological testing.",
        "ECT, an effective treatment for depression, does not cause significant side effects or neuropsychological impairment, which are more likely to be depressive phenomena. ECT appears to be safe for old (> or =65 years) and very old (> or =75 years) patients, who do not appear to be more susceptible to adverse effects."
