        "This study examined the psychometric value of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) translated for use with an Armenian population.",
        "Using data obtained from a country-wide health survey of 2310 households involving female and male respondents aged 18 and over, we investigated the response pattern to the CES-D items, the factor structure, internal consistency, inter-item correlations of the total scale and its negatively and positively formulated subscales. We used logistic regression analysis to relate the constructs measured by the CES-D and its subscales to known determinants of depression.",
        "Armenian respondents of both genders significantly suppressed their positive emotions, thus over-endorsing positively formulated (reverse-coded) items, therefore producing artificially high depression scores. Factor analysis of the scale yielded a three-factor structure (combined Depressed/Somatic, Positive Affect, and Interpersonal). The Positive Affect factor correlated weakly with the other two factors, and its inclusion reduced the internal consistency of the whole scale. Unlike the 16-item subscale of negatively formulated items, Positive Affect was not related to several known determinants of depression and did not reflect known depression-specific differences between genders. The set of determinants of Positive Affect included mainly lifestyle and attitudinal variables.",
        "This study did not assess the concurrent and discriminate validity of the Armenian CES-D.",
        "For Armenians, the construct measured by the four Positive Affect items of CES-D is not related to depressive symptoms as measured by the other items. It introduces ethnical/cultural response bias in CES-D score and reduces the cross-cultural comparability of the latter."
