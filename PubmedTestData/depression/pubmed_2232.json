        "<i>Background</i>: Researchers have found that an earlier age of disorder onset and the severity of the first depressive episode are associated with recurrence in depression. Additionally, neuroticism has been shown to be an important factor in the recurrence of the disorder.<i>Aims</i>: This exploratory study aimed to replicate and extend previous research by examining the relationships between features of the first experienced depressive episode (age of onset, severity), the five factors of personality, and lifetime chronicity of depression.<i>Method</i>: Forty-three previously depressed participants completed measures of personality, current depression, hopelessness, and perfectionism. Previous depressive episodes were assessed using a semi-structured interview, and features of these episodes experienced by participants were recorded.<i>Results</i>: Pearson correlations showed that depression chronicity, measured in the number of weeks depressed in a lifetime, was significantly correlated with age of onset and number of symptoms experienced in the first episode. Personality measures were not significantly associated with depression chronicity.<i>Conclusion</i>: Earlier and more severe first episodes of depression may play an important role in the recurrence of the disorder. Future research should focus on replication and determining the causal role of these features."
