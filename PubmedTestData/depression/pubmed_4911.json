        "Psychopathology has been closely related with artists. A link between creativity and a tendency to affective disorders has become widely accepted. Several studies have shown that artists suffer disproportionately high rates of mood disorders, particularly manic depression and major depression. The famous twentieth century Spanish artist Joan Mir\u00f3 suffered from depression during the entirety of his life, as was recognized by some authors in private letters. The artist worked using several styles, as well as in ceramics and sculpture. Some of his work reflects the feelings he experienced during the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. He contributed considerably to the world of art with works such as The Farm as the culminant work of detailism, The Harlequin's Carnival as one of the main expressions of surrealism, the Birth of the World as the precursor of abstract expressionism, or The Dutch Interiors with \"mironians\" shapes, among others. Whether depression was the inspiration for his work, or his work was the treatment for his depression, will never be clarified. However, he left a great legacy for humanity and his work is admired all over the world."
