        "Data from various scientific studies all over the world show that depression is becoming one of the biggest health problems in society. The aim of this study was to evaluate characteristics of depressiveness and its associations with psychosocial factors (stress, social support, suicidal intentions) in Lithuanian adult rural population.",
        "Within the Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Diseases Intervention (CINDI) program, the survey was carried out in a stratified random sample of population aged 25-64 in 5 rural regions of Lithuania between 2006 and 2007. A total of 1754 participants were examined.",
        "About half (43.8%) of respondents experienced high and moderate levels of depressiveness. Women in comparison to men reported higher levels of depressiveness. The likelihood of depressiveness among women was related to older age, lower education, small social network, lower level of social support, higher level of stress, and suicidal intentions. Whereas, the same indicator among men was associated with older age, lower education, being divorced, small social network, having no social support, higher level of stress, and suicidal intentions.",
        "Depressiveness is highly prevalent among Lithuanian rural population with a higher prevalence among women than men. Older persons and persons with lower education of both genders were more likely to be depressed than younger and more educated persons. Absence of social support, high level of stress, and suicidal intentions were related to higher levels of depressiveness in both genders. Depressiveness was more common among women having a small social network and divorced men."
