        "Depression often starts in adolescence making it an ideal time to intervene. We developed a universal cognitive behavioural therapy-based programme (MEMO CBT) to be delivered via multimedia mobile phone messages for teens.",
        "We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial in 15 high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, comparing MEMO CBT with a control programme [MEMO control] matched for intensity and type of message but with alternative content not targeting depression. The primary outcome was the change in score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised from baseline to 12\u00a0months. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores in the self-reported Reynold's Adolescent Depression Rating Scale-Second Edition, the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire, suicidal ideation using selected items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, the\u00a0Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, 12-month period prevalence of the diagnosis of depressive disorder using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and students' ratings of their satisfaction with the programme.",
        "Eight hundred and fifty-five students (13-17\u00a0years old, mean 14.3\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to MEMO CBT (426) or to MEMO Control (429). Participants (68% female) had a mean CDRS-R at baseline of 21.5 (SD: 5). Overall 394 (93%) from the intervention group and 392 (91%) from the control group were followed up at 12\u00a0months. At the end of the intervention (approximately 9\u00a0weeks) the mean CDRS-R scores were 20.8 in the intervention group versus 20.4 in the control group, and at 12\u00a0months they were 22.4 versus 22.4 (p value for difference in change from baseline\u00a0=\u00a00.3). There was no obvious association between the amount of the intervention viewed by participants and outcomes.",
        "There was no evidence of benefit from the mobile phone CBT intervention compared with a control programme. Universal depression prevention remains a challenge."
