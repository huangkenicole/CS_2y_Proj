        "The current set of pre-registered studies tested the effect of savoring a high-arousal (exciting) or low-arousal (calm) positive experience on help-seeking intentions among people with heightened depressive symptomatology.",
        "Across all three studies, participants with heightened depressive symptomatology who had not yet sought help were randomly assigned to complete a 6-minute writing task where they reflected on an exciting memory, a calm memory, or what they did today and yesterday.",
        "Savoring an exciting memory was associated with significantly greater arousal than savoring a calm memory and the control condition (Study 1; N\u00a0=\u00a0218). Both savoring conditions were associated with greater positive emotion than the control condition (Study 2; N\u00a0=\u00a0193). In Study 3 (N\u00a0=\u00a01,238), savoring an exciting memory, when compared to the control condition, increased help-seeking intentions, whereas savoring a calm memory did not.",
        "The current studies support the use of high-arousal, rather than low-arousal, positive emotions to increase help-seeking intentions among people with depression."
