        "Non-clinical depression is a major issue on college campuses, with some surveys estimating that 30% of college students have experienced a major depressive episode. One theoretical framework of depression is Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) time perspective model, which posits that our perspectives on time impact different aspects of life including our emotions, judgments, and decision making. The current study seeks to determine the role of this time perspectives model and a range of cognitive constructs including hope, rumination, and working memory on their influence in depression. Currently enrolled college students and participants not currently enrolled in college completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, the Adult Hope Scale, the Rumination Reflection Questionnaire, and the Automated Working Memory Assessment. Linear regression analysis revealed that, for the college students, Rumination and Past Negative scores predicted depressive symptoms. For the non-college students, Rumination, Present Fatalism, Hope Agency and Verbal Working Memory scores predicted depressive symptoms. The current results reiterate the importance of rumination in depression symptomology and that current cognitive depression models and treatments may benefit from including time perspective measures. Further implications of the results are discussed."
