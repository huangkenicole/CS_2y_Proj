        "Depression and obesity are both highly prevalent and are leading public health problems. These foregoing disorders independently have great impact on morbidity and mortality affecting patients' health and well-being as well as on the socioeconomic aspect of functional impairment and healthcare expenditure. Results from epidemiological studies, clinical trials and recent meta-analyses support the association between mood disorders and obesity as both frequently co-occur in all races of populations examined. It is now well-established through longitudinal studies that obesity is a risk factor for mood disorders and vice versa. In the current review, we aim to address the evidence regarding 4 questions: (1) does obesity moderate response to antidepressants among patients with depressive disorders?, (2) does the presence of depressive disorders moderate the progression or outcome of obesity?, (3) does treatment of obesity moderate outcomes among patients with depressive disorders?, and (4) does treatment of depressive disorders moderate outcomes of obesity? In order to improve the interpretability of the results we confined the evaluations to studies where patients met the criteria for depressive disorders or obesity (i.e. BMI>30). Extant evidence supports the association between obesity and adverse health outcomes among individuals with depressive disorders. In addition, the treatment of one condition (i.e. obesity or depressive disorders) appears to improve the course of the other condition. It might be beneficial to check for the other condition in patients presenting with one condition and treatment should be administered to treat both conditions."
