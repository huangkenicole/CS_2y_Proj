        "To explore recent research evidence addressing men's depression and suicide. Included are discussions of recent literature investigating male depression symptoms, and men's depression and suicidality help-seeking and engagement with professional mental health care services.",
        "Specific externalizing symptoms of substance misuse, risk-taking, and poor impulse control among men indicate the need for gender-sensitized depression screening and risk assessments. The reticence of some men for seeking professional health care has drawn public awareness raising and de-stigmatizing efforts, while clinical guidelines for working with boys and men have been offered to better serve men seeking help for depression and/or suicidality. There is a strengthening case for male depression comprising specific externalizing symptomology, and these findings, along with high male suicide rates (including men who are seemingly in care), indicate the need for tailored approaches to men's depression and suicide prevention."
