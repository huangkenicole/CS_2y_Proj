        "Childhood maltreatment is associated with the development and maintenance of mental disorders. The purpose of this naturalistic study was (a) to identify different patterns of childhood maltreatment, (b) to examine how these patterns are linked to the severity of mental disorders and (c) whether they are predictive of treatment outcome.",
        "742 adult patients of a university hospital for psychotherapy and psychosomatics were assessed at intake and discharge by standardized questionnaires assessing depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) and general mental distress (Symptom Check List-90-R, SCL-90-R). Traumatic childhood experience (using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, CTQ) and ICD-10 diagnoses were assessed at intake.",
        "The patients could be allocated to three different patterns of early childhood trauma experience: mild traumatization, multiple traumatization without sexual abuse and multiple traumatization with sexual abuse. The three patterns showed highly significant differences in BDI, General Severity Index (GSI) and in the number of comorbidity at intake. For both BDI and GSI a general decrease in depression and general mental distress from intake to discharge could be shown. The three patterns differed in BDI and GSI at intake and discharge, indicating lowest values for mild traumatization and highest values for multiple traumatization with sexual abuse. Patients with multiple traumatization with sexual abuse showed the least favourable outcome.",
        "The results provide evidence that the severity of childhood traumatization is linked to the severity of mental disorders and also to the treatment outcome in inpatient psychotherapy. In the study, three different patterns of childhood traumatization (mild traumatization, multiple traumatization without sexual abuse, multiple traumatization with sexual abuse) showed differences in the severity of mental disorder and in the course of treatment within the same therapy setting."
