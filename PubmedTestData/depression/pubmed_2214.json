        "This study was performed on 65 depressed in-patients who were included in previously reported trials of imipramine and clomipramine. Before and during treatment, blood samples were collected for estimation of the availability of tryptophan and tyrosine by measurement of their plasma ratios to competing amino acids, and for determination of plasma steady-state concentrations of imipramine, clomipramine and their demethylated metabolites. The patients were classified as endogenous or 'non-endogenous' depressives by means of diagnostic rating scales, and therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by means of the Hamilton rating scales. Neither imipramine nor clomipramine increased the availability of tryptophan or tyrosine. Three biochemical regions were defined: a low region including mostly patients with subnormal availability of both tryptophan and tyrosine, a medium region, and a high region including mostly patients with supernormal precursor availabilities. Endogenous depressives showed about the same biochemical distribution as controls whereas there tended to be a proportionately higher number of 'non-endogenous' depressives within the low region. Patients in the low region, irrespective of diagnostic classification, improved faster and more on imipramine than patients in the medium and high regions with comparable plasma drug levels. Patients on clomipramine tended to show a relationship between precursor availabilities and clinical response but no definite conclusion could be drawn from these data. The results suggest that determination of the pre-treatment tryptophan and tyrosine availability may be superior to diagnostic classification in predicting response to imipramine. The possible mode of action of tricyclic antidepressants is briefly discussed."
