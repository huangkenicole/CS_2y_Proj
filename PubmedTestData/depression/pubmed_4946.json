      "AbstractText": [
        "Brainstem raphe (BR) hypoechogenicity in transcranial sonography (TCS) has been depicted in patients with major depression (MD) and in depressed patients with different neurodegenerative diseases. But, up to date, the association of BR alterations in TCS with depression in migraineurs has never been reported. This study was to investigate the possible role of BR examination via TCS in migraineurs with depression.",
        "Forty two migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and 40 healthy controls were recruited. Echogenicity of lentiform nuclei (LN), caudate nuclei (CN), substantia nigra (SN) and brainstem raphe (BR) and width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle were assessed with TCS. The diagnosis of depression was based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM -IV), and the severity of depression was measured by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale (HADS-D).",
        "There were no significant differences between migraineurs and controls in the width of frontal horn of the lateral ventricle (p\u2009=\u20090.955), width of third ventricle (p\u2009=\u20090.129) as well as in the echogenicity of SN (p\u2009=\u20090.942), CN (p\u2009=\u20090.053), LN (p\u2009=\u20090.052) and BR (p\u2009=\u20090.677). Here, it seems that more migraineurs were detected with increased echogenecity of CN and LN compared with controls (33.3% versus 15.0% for CN, 19.0% versus 5.0% for LN) though they had no statistical significance. Patients with hypoechogenic BR had significantly higher HAM-D and HADS-D scores than those with normal BR signal (p\u2009=\u20090.000 for both HAM-D and HADS-D), and most (83.33%) migraineurs with depression exhibited hypoechogenic raphe but none (0.00%) of the migraineurs without depression exhibited hypoechogenic raphe (p\u2009=\u20090.000).",
        "TCS signal alteration of BR can be a biomarker for depression in migraine but it is not associated with migraine headache itself. LN and CN alterations in TCS may reflect a potential role of them in the pathogenesis of migraine, which needs to be further elucidated."
