      "AbstractText": [
        "Psychological treatment of depression can be made more accessible with internet-based interventions. A large number of trials has shown that on average these interventions are more effective when some kind of personal support by a clinician is given compared to unguided interventions. In order to examine whether there are subgroups of patients for whom unguided interventions are as effective as guided interventions, we conducted an 'individual patient data' network meta-analysis in which the primary data of 36 randomised trials with 8107 patients were integrated into one dataset. We found that several patient characteristics predict the outcome. Unguided interventions were as effective as guided interventions in mild depression. These data also make it possible to predict which patient with which characteristics benefits from guided and unguided interventions. We consider this as an important step towards personalised treatment of depression."
