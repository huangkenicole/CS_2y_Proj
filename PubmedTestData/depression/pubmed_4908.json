        "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> The Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale is widely used in clinical research to assess symptoms and functioning in the context of treatment. The correlates of the CGI-I with efficacy scales for adolescent major depressive disorder are poorly understood. This study focused on benchmarking CGI-I scores with changes in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Adolescent (17-item) Self-Report (QIDS-A17-SR). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We examined three datasets with the clinician-rated CDRS-R to ascertain equivalent percent changes in total scores and CGI-I ratings. Exploratory analyses examined corresponding percentage changes in the QIDS-A17-SR and the CGI-I ratings. The CGI-I was the reference scale for nonparametric equipercentile linking with the Equate package in R. <b><i>Results:</i></b> CGI-I scores of 1 mapped to \u226578%-95% change in CDRS-R scores at 4-6 weeks across three datasets. CGI-I scores of 2 mapped to 56%-94% change in CDRS-R scores at 4-6 weeks across three studies. CGI-I scores of 3 mapped to 30%-68% changes in CDRS-R scores at 4-6 weeks across three studies. CGI-I scores of 4 mapped to a range of 29%-44% at 4-6 weeks across three studies. There was no significant difference (<i>p</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090.6) between treatment groups in both the Treatment of Adolescents with Depression and Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents studies, for each CGI-I score (\u2009=\u20091, or\u2009=\u20092 or\u2009=\u20093, or \u22654), associated mapping of total depression severity score, or associated percent change from baseline for corresponding follow-up visits. There was no significant sex difference (<i>p</i>\u2009>\u20090.2) in CGI-I linkages to CDRS-R total or percentage changes. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> These findings establish clear relationships among CGI-I scores and the CDRS-R and the QIDS-A17-SR. These benchmarks have utility for clinical trial study design, inter-rater reliability training, and clinical implementation."
