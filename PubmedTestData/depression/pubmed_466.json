        "Twenty family physicians (11 female and 9 male) were interviewed about their experiences in treating depressed patients. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically with respect to physicians' understanding of women's depression and their treatment strategies with depressed women. Stress arising in the social context of women's lives was perceived as a key precipitant of depression in women, with family-related, gender-specific and practical sources of stress as the main contributors. Physicians' treatment strategies had the aims of alleviating depressive symptoms and stress reduction. Implications of the findings for primary health care delivery and community-based interventions with depressed women are discussed."
