        "For the assessing the incidence of mood disturbances among the neurological out-patients 3287 of them were examined by 111 neurologists during their routine practice. Early diagnosis, the type of mood disturbances and the depth of depression were estimated by the use of Beck's Depression Inventory, the questionnaire based on The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, as well. Around half of the patients (50.47%) were suspected on depression, as an early diagnosis. In suspected and diagnosed depressive patients the symptoms as anxiety, low activity precordial pain, headaches, dry mouth, constipation, sleep and appetite troubles were significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent than in euthymic subjects. Among all studied patients the episode of depression were found as a final diagnose in 17.2%, recurrent depressive disorders--in 17.6% and dysthymia--in 2.8% of subjects. In finally diagnosed depressive patients the chronic neurological problems were significantly (p = 0.013) more frequent, as the cause of the visit, than in the euthymic ones. The low mood was equally frequent among the patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebrovascular disorders, as well."
