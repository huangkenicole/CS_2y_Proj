      "AbstractText": [
        "Depression is one of the most prevalent, disabling, and costly mental illnesses currently affecting over 300 million people worldwide. A subset of depressed patients display inflammation as indicated by increased levels of proinflammatory mediators in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Longitudinal and experimental studies suggest that this inflammatory profile may causally contribute to the initiation, maintenance, or recurrence of depressive episodes in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD). While the mechanistic pathways that mediate these depressogenic effects have not yet been fully elucidated, toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is one potential common inflammatory pathway. In this review, we focus on the role that inflammation plays in depression, TLR signaling and its plasticity as a candidate pathway, its regulation by micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for identification of inflammatory subtypes of depression. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that TLR expression and TLR signaling regulators are associated with MDD. Further, TLR expression and signaling is in-turn, regulated in part by miRNAs and some TLR-responsive miRNAs indirectly modulate pathways that are implicated in MDD pathophysiology. These data suggest an intersection between TLR signaling regulation and MDD-linked pathways. While these studies suggest that miRNAs play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD via their regulatory effects on TLR pathways, the utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and potential treatment targets remains to be determined. Developing new and innovative techniques or adapting established immunological approaches to mental health, should be at the forefront in moving the field forward, especially in terms of categorization of inflammatory subtypes in MDD."
