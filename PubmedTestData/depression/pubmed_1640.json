        "Erotomania is a delusional phenomenon in which patient believes that some celebrity is in love with her. It is associated with various psychiatric illnesses. We herein present a report of a young woman with erotomanic delusion diagnosed with recurrent depression, current episode being severe with psychotic features. A 22-year woman, previously treated for a depressive episode three years ago, was brought by the mother for evaluation. The woman presented with symptoms of depression for the past six months along with the delusion that famous singer SY is in love with her for the past two months. This has resulted in a gross decline in social and academic functioning. Psychometrics revealed Beck's depression inventory (BDI) score of 36 and brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score of 41. A diagnosis of recurrent depression with current severe episode with psychotic features, was made at our psychiatric facility. This case report highlights that psychotic depression can present with a rare mood incongruent delusion of erotomanic content and accurate diagnosis and management require adequate knowledge about this phenomenon."
