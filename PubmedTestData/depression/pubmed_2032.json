      "AbstractText": [
        "Complex disorders, such as depression, remain a mystery for scientists. Although genetic factors are considered important for the prediction of one's vulnerability, it is hard to estimate the exact risk for a patient to develop depression, based only on one category of vulnerability criteria. Genetic factors also regulate drug metabolism, and when they are identified in a specific combination, may result in increased drug resistance. A proper understanding of the genetic basis of depression assists in the development of novel promising medications and effective disorder management schemes. This review aims to analyze the recent literature focusing on the correlation between specific genes and the occurrence of depression. Moreover, certain aspects targeting a high drug resistance identified among patients suffering from major depressive disorder were highlighted in this manuscript. An expected direction of future drug discovery campaigns was also discussed."
