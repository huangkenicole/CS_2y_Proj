        "Late-life depression (LLD) is the most common mental disorder among the elderly, but its clinical features remain unclear, especially among older adults. We sought to investigate if age, sex and education could influence the severity or frequency of LLD symptoms.",
        "We evaluated 639 community-dwelling individuals aged 75+ years in Caet\u00e9 (MG), Brazil. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to diagnose major depression according to DSM-IV criteria and the GDS-15 to measure depression severity.",
        "Excluding 174 individuals diagnosed with dementia, 54 (11.6%) of the remaining 457 individuals were diagnosed with LLD; 77.8% of which were female. On average, these participants were aged 81.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\u2009years and had 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3\u2009years of schooling. Symptom severity was not influenced by sociodemographic variables. Death/suicidal ideation was more frequent among men, while psychomotor disturbance was more present in women (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04 and <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.042). More educated individuals (\u2265 4\u2009years) also reported a higher frequency of psychomotor disturbance (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.039).",
