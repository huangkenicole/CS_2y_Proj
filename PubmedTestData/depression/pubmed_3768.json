      "AbstractText": [
        "Major depressive disorder (MDD) has far reaching impacts for young people, their families and society. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the first-line treatments for young people experiencing MDD; however, there is limited research examining how young people with MDD experience CBT. The aim of this study was to explore their experience and their views of this intervention.",
        "We employed a qualitative research design, with semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. Eight participants aged between 17 and 24\u2009years who received CBT for MDD in a randomized controlled trial were recruited.",
        "Five themes were identified: the importance of relationship with clinician; the range of useful components within CBT; the ability for CBT to accommodate different techniques and presenting issues; the importance of checking in with clients during the process of therapy; and the impacts of MDD on therapy.",
        "The findings highlight the importance of clinicians having a youth friendly and collaborative approach that allows a modular delivery of a range of CBT techniques to suit the client's presenting issue and formulation. There is a need to continually check how young people are responding to interventions, and to be aware of potential cognitive deficits and adjust therapy accordingly. This is a small study that provides insight into how young people with MDD experience CBT and avenues to explore for tailoring provision of CBT to enhance the therapeutic experience for this population."
