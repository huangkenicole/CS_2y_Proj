        "The literature regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines in geriatric depression is sparse. The aim of this study was to examine associations between CSF interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and depression in a population-based sample of older women who were followed for 17 years.",
        "86 dementia-free women aged 70-84 years who participated in the Prospective Population Study of Women in Gothenburg, Sweden took part in a lumbar puncture in 1992-3. CSF IL-6 and CSF IL-8 were measured. Psychiatric symptoms were rated with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale at baseline and at three subsequent face-to-face examinations. Depression (major or minor) was diagnosed in accordance with DSM-IV/DSM-IV research criteria.",
        "At baseline, women with ongoing major (n=10) or minor depression (n=9) had higher levels of CSF IL-6 (p=0.008) and CSF IL-8 (p=0.007) compared with those without depression (n=67). Higher CSF IL-8 was related to higher MADRS score (p=0.003). New cases of depression were observed in 9 women during follow-ups. No associations between CSF cytokine levels and future depression could be shown in women without depression at baseline.",
        "Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with current depression in this population-based sample. CSF IL-6 and CSF IL-8 may play a role in depression in late life."
