        "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common among elderly people. However, it appears that only a minority receives treatment. This study aims to identify and analyse the factors that determine whether elderly people with depressive disorders have contact with health care professionals for mental problems.",
        "Cross-sectional analysis of cohort data collected in the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older persons (NESDO) and the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) among 167 respondents aged \u226555 with a depressive disorder as indicated by the CIDI. Contacts for mental health problems during the past six months (TiC-P), and indicators of predisposing, enabling, and objective need factors were assessed by interview.",
        "Of the total sample, 70% had contact for mental health problems, almost entirely within primary care (62%). The odds of having contact increased with advancing age; for respondents born in the Netherlands; for those who felt less lonely; and for those with a higher household income.",
        "Our study is based on base-line interviews and thus has a cross-sectional character. Therefore, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Furthermore, we studied the respondents' perception whether mental health care was received.",
        "The contact rate for mental health problems is high. Health care professionals should be aware that having contact is not associated with a higher objective need, but rather with increasing age, being Dutch-born, being less lonely and having a higher household income."
