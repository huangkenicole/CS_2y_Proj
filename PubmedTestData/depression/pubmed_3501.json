        "Post-stroke depression is a frequent complication of cerebrovascular lesions and mainly occurs within the first 6\u00a0months after stroke. Stroke patients who develop depression have slower recovery, greater disability, and higher mortality rates. The pathophysiology of post-stroke depression is not yet clearly defined, but studies suggest contributions from both psychosocial factors and stroke-related factors, such as lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits. Early treatment has a positive impact on post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and survival. We present the case of\u00a0an 82-year-old man with no psychiatric history who was brought to the psychiatric emergency department after two suicide attempts in the span of 7 days. He was severely depressed, with feelings of hopelessness, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. He had suffered a stroke the week before, affecting the anterior portion of the left cingulate gyrus, causing right hemiparesis and paresthesia. The psychiatric symptoms developed immediately after the stroke and were not present before the event. He was admitted to the psychiatry ward, treated with sertraline 100\u00a0mg/day and quetiapine 50\u00a0mg/day and discharged within 28\u00a0days, after full remission of symptoms. Our case strengthens the association between lesions located to the frontal-subcortical circuits and post-stroke depression. Physicians should be vigilant regarding the occurrence of depression in stroke patients, especially those who suffer lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits and related regions."
