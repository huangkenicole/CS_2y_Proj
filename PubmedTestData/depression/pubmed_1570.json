        "Introduction To estimate the prevalence, incidence and course of depressive symptoms, their relationship with return-to-work, and prevalence of depression diagnosis/treatment 12\u00a0months following a lost-time workplace musculoskeletal injury. Methods In a prospective cohort study, 332 workers' compensation claimants with a back or upper extremity musculoskeletal disorder completed interviews at 1, 6 and 12\u00a0months post-injury. Participants self-reported they had not received a depression diagnosis 1\u00a0year pre-injury. Cutoff of 16 on the CES-D defined a high level of depressive symptoms. Self-reported data on depression diagnosis and treatment and work status since injury were collected. Results Cumulative incidence of high depressive symptom levels over 12\u00a0months was 50.3\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 44.9-55.7\u00a0%). At 12\u00a0months, 24.7\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 20.1-29.3\u00a0%) of workers exhibited high levels. Over 12\u00a0months, 49.7\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 44.3-55.1\u00a0%) had low levels at all 3 interviews, 14.5\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 10.7-18.2\u00a0%) had persistently high levels, and 25.6\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 20.9-30.3\u00a0%) demonstrated improvements. Among workers with low baseline levels, incidence of high levels at 12\u00a0months was 6.0\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 2.7-9.3\u00a0%). For workers with high baseline levels, 36.1\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 27.9-44.3\u00a0%) exhibited persistent high symptoms at 6 and 12\u00a0months, while 38.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 30.1-46.6\u00a0%) experienced low levels at 6 and 12\u00a0months. Problematic RTW outcomes were common among workers with a poor depressive symptom course. Among workers with persistent high symptoms, 18.8\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 7.7-29.8\u00a0%) self-reported receiving a depression diagnosis by 12\u00a0months and 29.2\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 16.3-42.0\u00a0%) were receiving treatment at 12\u00a0months. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are common in the first year following a lost-time musculoskeletal injury and a poor depressive symptom course is associated with problematic RTW outcomes 12\u00a0months post-injury. While symptoms appear to improve over time, the first 6\u00a0months appear to be important in establishing future symptom levels and may represent a window of opportunity for early screening."
