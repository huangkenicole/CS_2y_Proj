        "It remains unclear whether psychotic depression (PD) compared to non-psychotic depression (non-PD) among older adults is associated with poorer cognitive performance. For inpatients (60+) with a major depressive episode, cognitive performance in PD and non-PD (categorical)\u00a0were compared as well as the relationship between symptom severity for depression and psychosis (dimensional) and cognition. Of 90 participants (on average 72.7 years old; range 60-92), 64% were female. The severity of depressive- and psychotic symptoms are both negatively associated with cognitive functioning among older adults with depression. This is of relevance for the treatment of this vulnerable group of patients."
