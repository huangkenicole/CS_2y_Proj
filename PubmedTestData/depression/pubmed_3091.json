        "There is an ongoing debate about the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as some of these beliefs seem to be relevant in depressed patients as well. The present study aimed to elucidate the specificity of dysfunctional beliefs using the newly developed Beliefs Questionnaire (BQ). A combination of an online assessment and clinical interviews was carried out. One hundred thirty OCD patients (M\u202f=\u202f38.7 years; 68% women) were compared to 85 patients with depression (M\u202f=\u202f36.6 years; 75% women) and 220 nonclinical controls (M\u202f=\u202f38.9 years; 71% women) on the BQ, which contains 13 items tapping cognitive beliefs. The BQ was validated against the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ). Patients with OCD and depression scored higher on the BQ compared to nonclinical controls. OCD patients displayed higher values on overestimation of threat and the fear of becoming insane. Correlation between BQ and OBQ total scores was high (r\u202f=\u202f0.751), supporting the validity of the new scale. Our results show that two beliefs are OCD-specific. However, the BQ covers mainly transdiagnostic features and should be replicated with the inclusion of an anxiety disorder sample."
