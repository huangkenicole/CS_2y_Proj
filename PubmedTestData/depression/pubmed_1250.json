        "Depression is the leading cause of disability among people across the globe, according to the World Health Organization. Among those who have been diagnosed, many fail to achieve remission after following recommended antidepressant medication and psychosocial therapies. In particular, difficult-to-treat and treatment-resistant depression may cause severe impairments for patients, including diminished cognitive functioning, increased medical bills, and decreased workplace performance, as well as an increased risk of developing comorbid illnesses. However, many tools are available to clinicians for identifying treatment-resistant depression, including rating scales such as the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), as well as clinical evidence related to risk factors for difficult-to-treat or treatment-resistant depression. Accurately identifying treatment-resistant depression is the first step toward changing treatment regimens to help patients achieve remission."
