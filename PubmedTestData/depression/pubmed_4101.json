        "The objective was to examine Veterans' preferences for romantic partner involvement in depression treatment and patient characteristics that are associated with the likelihood of preferred involvement.",
        "One hundred seventy-nine Veterans who met criteria for major or minor depression reported if they wanted their partners to give them medication reminders, accompany them to appointments, and speak with their treatment provider.",
        "Greater depression severity and wanting a partner to be less critical and more encouraging were associated with greater preferences for involvement.",
        "Veterans may view their partners' involvement in depression treatment as one opportunity for partners to decrease blame or understand more about their problems."
