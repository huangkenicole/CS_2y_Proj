        "We examined race differences in the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion (CSC), an indicator of depressive role impairment, and its impact on assessment outcomes in older white and black women with diagnosed and subthreshold depression.",
        "We conducted a secondary analysis of a community-based interview study, using group comparisons and logistic regression.",
        "Lower-income neighborhoods in a Midwestern city.",
        "411 community-dwelling depressed and non-depressed women \u2265 65 years (45.3% Black; mean age = 75.2, SD = 7.2) recruited through census tract-based telephone screening.",
        "SCID interview for DSM-IV to assess major depression and dysthymia; Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to define subthreshold depression (\u226516 points); Mini-Mental State Examination, count of medical conditions, activities of daily living, and mental health treatment to assess health factors.",
        "Black participants were less likely than Whites to endorse the CSC (11.8% vs. 24.1%; p = .002). There were few race differences in depressive symptom type, severity, or count. Blacks with subthreshold depression endorsed more symptoms, though this comparison was not significant after adjustments. Health factors did not account for race differences in CSC endorsement. Disregarding the CSC-eliminated differences in diagnosis rate, race was a significant predictor of CSC endorsement in a logistic regression.",
        "Race differences in CSC endorsement are not due to depressive symptom presentations or health factors. The use of the CSC may lead to underdiagnosis of depression among black older adults. Subthreshold depression among Blacks may be more severe compared to Whites, thus requiring tailored assessment and treatment approaches."
