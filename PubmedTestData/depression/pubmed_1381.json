        "<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to review the alteration of plasma nesfatin-1 levels in patients with depression.<b>Methods:</b> Under the guidance of the latest PRISMA checklist, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching English database (PubMed, Web of Science, EMDASE) and Chinese database for relevant studies up to August, 2019. Pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated with the random effects model.<b>Results:</b> Nine studies that reported the association between plasma levels of nesfatin-1 and the risk of depression with 567 patients and 447 control participants were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the healthy controls, depressive patients had a higher plasma level of nesfatin-1 [SMD (95% CI):1.58(0.75, 2.41), <i>Z</i>\u2009=\u20093.74, <i>p</i> for <i>Z</i>\u2009<\u20090.001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 96.8%, <i>p</i> for <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> < 0.001]. The subgroup analyses and meta-regression failed to find the source of the heterogeneity. No evidence of publication bias was found either in Begg's test (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.348) or the Egger's test (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.523).<b>Conclusion:</b> The present meta-analysis indicated that a higher plasma level of nesfatin-1 was associated with an increased risk of depression."
