        "To explore rural family physicians' decision-making processes when they encounter depression.",
        "Exploratory qualitative \"field study\" using individual in-depth interviews and participant observation. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed by an editing approach.",
        "Rural Nebraska family physicians' offices.",
        "A purposeful sample of six rural Nebraska family physicians, including five men and one woman, aged 35 to 65 years; two in solo practice, three in two-person practices, and one in a group practice; in communities with populations ranging from 600 to 6500.",
        "Themes common to all interviews.",
        "Themes included the following: depression is easy to recognize but difficult to diagnose; depression is readily treatable but requires negotiation to manage; and depression is important but time and resources are limited. The inadequate diagnosis and treatment of depression appeared to be partly artifactual and must be understood against a background of perceived stigma, high prevalence of depressive symptoms, structural barriers to care, and context of rural practice.",
        "Rural family physicians may have a more deliberate, organized, and rational approach to depressive disorders than previously reported. Depression is commonly recognized by rural family physicians; however, they hesitate to diagnose this condition because of diagnostic uncertainty, perceived stigma, the desire to preserve the physician-patient relationship, time and financial pressures, and a lack of supporting resources."
