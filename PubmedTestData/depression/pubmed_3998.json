        "Little is known regarding the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with both coronary heart disease (CHD) and type D personality, and whether these patients may benefit from psychotherapy that modifies metacognitive beliefs implicated in disorder maintenance. This study explored prevalence rates among these patients and associations between type D characteristics, rumination and metacognitions.",
        "Forty-seven consecutive patients with CHD who scored positive for type D personality were included in this pre-planned study. Participants underwent structured clinical interviews for mental and personality disorders and completed questionnaires assessing rumination and metacognitions.",
        "Mean age was 53.8 (SD 8.1) years and 21.3% were female. At least one mood disorder or anxiety disorder was found in 70.2% and 61.7% of the patients. The most common disorders were major depressive disorder (59.6%), social phobia (40.4%), and generalized anxiety disorder (29.8%). At least one personality disorder was detected in 42.6%. Only 21% reported ongoing treatment with psychotropic medication whereas none had psychotherapy. Metacognitions and rumination were significantly associated with negative affectivity (0.53-0.72, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.001) but not social inhibition.",
        "Mood and anxiety disorders were highly prevalent and relatively untreated among these patients. Future studies should test the metacognitive model for type D personality."
