        "Residual depressive symptoms are associated with a poor prognosis for relapse or recurrence and are recognized as impeding factors of functionality. Recovery to the pre-depression level of functioning should be the goal of treatment.",
        "To evaluate outcomes in depressed outpatients treated with escitalopram regarding response, recovery, residual symptoms, functionality and ability to work over 48 weeks.",
        "3278 outpatients were evaluated at weeks 8, 24 and 48. A simple questionnaire was used to rate severity of illness, impairment of functionality, treatment response, tolerability, presence and severity of residual symptoms, whether remission with residual symptoms or recovery was achieved, and to what degree the patient was able to work.",
        "Data over the full 48-week period were available for 75.8% of patients, for whom treatment response was rated as \"very good\" or \"good\" in 81%. However, only 42% of the completing patients achieved recovery without residual symptoms, while 41% were rated as remitters with residual symptoms. Lack of energy/motivation was the most common reported residual symptom and was present in 23.5% of patients at study end. Concentration difficulties were present in 15.8% and impaired sleep in 13.9% of patients. Complete inability to work decreased from 36% at baseline to 9% at week 48, while full-time working capacity increased from 37% to 62%.",
        "Non-controlled observational real life study using simple ratings rather than established rating scales.",
        "<50% of patients completing a one-year antidepressant treatment regimen were rated as being symptomatically fully recovered, and \u224850% still reported functional deficits."
