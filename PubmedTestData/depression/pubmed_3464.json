        "Globally, geriatric depression (GD) has been recognized to be one of the most prevalent problems among the elderly. However, there is an only one previous Bangladeshi study addressing the issue. Consequently, the present study investigated GD and its associated risk factors. A semi-structured face-to-face interview was conducted among 168 self-reported healthy elderly residents (59.5% female) aged 60-80 years in Patuakhali city and the neighboring village. Measures included the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, socio-demographic variables, psychosocial factors, physical health-related factors, lifestyle factors, and dietary factors. Results showed the GD prevalence rate was 36.9% (n\u202f=\u202f62). Risk factors for GD included living in a rural area, having no history of chronic disease, having a history of previous personal and/or family depression, not engaging in daily life activities, not exercising regularly, having no hobbies, having a poor diet, and not engaging in religious practices regularly. The GD prevalence rate was generally higher compared to previous studies in other countries. This may have been due to the inclusion criterion of selecting self-reported healthy elderly individuals. It is recommended that a nationally representative study is carried out to assess the actual figure of GD in Bangladesh. The findings are helpful for depression-reducing intervention programs."
