      "AbstractText": [
        "To determine whether, for patients with depression and Parkinson disease (PD), telephone-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (T-CBT) alleviates depressive symptoms significantly more than treatment as usual (TAU), we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a 10-session T-CBT intervention for depression in PD, compared to TAU.",
        "Seventy-two people with PD (PWP) were randomized to T-CBT + TAU or TAU only. T-CBT tailored to PWPs' unique needs was provided weekly for 3 months, then monthly during 6-month follow-up. CBT targeted negative thoughts (e.g., \"I have no control\"; \"I am helpless\") and behaviors (e.g., social withdrawal, excessive worry). It also trained care partners to help PWP practice healthy habits. Blind raters assessed outcomes at baseline, midtreatment, treatment end, and 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Analyses were intent to treat.",
        "T-CBT outperformed TAU on all depression, anxiety, and quality of life measures. The primary outcome (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score) improved significantly in T-CBT compared to TAU by treatment end. Mean improvement from baseline was 6.53 points for T-CBT and -0.27 points for TAU (<i>p</i> < 0.0001); gains persisted over 6-month follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Improvements were moderated by a reduction in negative thoughts in the T-CBT group only, reflecting treatment target engagement.",
        "T-CBT may be an effective depression intervention that addresses a significant unmet PD treatment need and bypasses access barriers to multidisciplinary, evidence-based care.",
        "NCT02505737.",
        "This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with depression and PD, T-CBT significantly alleviated depressive symptoms compared to usual care."
