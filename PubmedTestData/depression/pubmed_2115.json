        "To identify moderators of treatment effect for Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) versus Treatment As Usual (TAU) in depressed patients.",
        "An individual patient data-analysis was performed on three randomized-controlled trials, investigating the effect of MBCT\u00a0+\u00a0TAU versus TAU alone (N\u202f=\u202f292). Patients were either in (partial) remission, currently depressed or had chronic, treatment-resistant depression. Outcomes were depressive symptoms and quality of life. The QUalitative INteraction Trees (QUINT) method was used to identify subgroups that benefited more from either condition.",
        "MBCT\u00a0+\u00a0TAU outperformed TAU in reducing depressive symptoms. For both conditions, the effect of baseline depressive symptoms on post-treatment depressive symptoms was curvilinear. QUINT analyses revealed that MBCT\u00a0+\u00a0TAU was more beneficial than TAU for patients with an earlier onset and higher rumination levels in terms of depressive symptom reduction and for patients with a lower quality of life in terms of improving quality of life.",
        "The results suggest that MBCT might be more beneficial for those with earlier onset and higher levels of rumination and for patients with a lower quality of life. Sophisticated analytical techniques such as QUINT can be used in future research to improve personalized assignment of MBCT to patients. Long-term outcome could also be integrated in this."
