        "Around 50% of depressed patients do not respond to antidepressants. Evidence from familial studies suggests a genetic component to this. This study investigated whether patients with polymorphisms in genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were less likely to respond to antidepressants.",
        "EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Inclusionary criteria were: 1) patients with depression, 2) study of HPA axis-related candidate genes, 3) at least four weeks of antidepressants, and 4) assessment of depressive symptoms dividing patients into non-responders and responders.",
        "Nineteen studies were identified. Non-responders and responders did not differ in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding arginine vasopressin. Findings were equivocal regarding genes encoding the FK506 binding protein 5 and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Specific SNPs and haplotypes within genes related to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRHBP, CRHR1) and melanocortins (POMC) predicted non-responder status.",
        "Replication studies and additional investigations exploring gene x environment and drug x environment interactions are necessary before pharmacological treatments may be adjusted based on a patient's genetic profile."
