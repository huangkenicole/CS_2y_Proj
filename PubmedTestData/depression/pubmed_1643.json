        "The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with antidepressant use in non-depressed and depressed elderly persons, assuming that they varied according to clinical status.",
        "We studied 7,868 French community-dwelling subjects aged 65 years and over. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to define three groups: non-depressed, high depressive symptoms and current major depressive disorder. Separate analyses were performed to identify the factors which were associated with antidepressant use in each group.",
        "Antidepressant use (55% selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, 25% tricyclic antidepressants, 20% other types) increased from 4.9% in non-depressed subjects to 17.3% in subjects with high depressive symptoms (HDS) and 33.6% of in those with current major depressive disorder (MDD). The factors associated with antidepressant use varied according to depression status. In particular, men with current MDD were more often treated with antidepressants than women whereas, in both the HDS and the non-depressed groups, antidepressant use was, as has been observed elsewhere, more frequent in women. Gender also had a strong modifying effect on the relationship between antidepressant use and history of major depression. Finally, the direction of the association between antidepressant use and cognitive performance varied according to depression status.",
        "This study showed that the direction and strength of the association between antidepressant use and demographic and health-related factors varied according to the severity of depression symptoms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between gender and cognition and antidepressant use."
