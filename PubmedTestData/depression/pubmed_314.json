        "Depression is common among patients with diabetes, who have a higher risk of diabetes-related complications such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and macrovascular complications. The aim of the systematic review is to determine whether cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving glycaemic control among depressed diabetic patients. The results reveal diversified application of cognitive behavioural therapy. All studies reported that cognitive behavioural therapy had a positive impact on depressive symptoms; three found an improvement in glycated haemoglobin, and one demonstrated improved self-efficacy and self-concept related to successful diabetes management. There is a need for controlled studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up."
