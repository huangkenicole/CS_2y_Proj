        "Children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether adolescents with MDD manifest evidence of dyslipidemia, a key risk factor for CVD, is unknown.",
        "Youth recruited through an ambulatory psychiatry clinic and the community, were categorized following diagnostic interview as MDD or as healthy controls [HC]. CVD risk factors including high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride concentrations were collected. Depression severity was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children. The associations of diagnostic group as well as depressive symptom severity with lipid concentrations were examined using multiple regression analyses. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and standardized Body Mass Index.",
        "Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0243) were 68\u00a0% female with a mean age of 15.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.81\u00a0years. MDD and HC participants had comparable levels of dyslipidemia (MDD: 48\u00a0%, HC: 46\u00a0%, p\u00a0>\u00a0.7) and hypertriglyceridemia (MDD: 34\u00a0%, HC: 30\u00a0%, p\u00a0>\u00a0.7). Among depressed adolescents, greater depressive symptoms were associated with higher total cholesterol concentrations in unadjusted models only. Greater depressive symptoms were associated with higher HDL concentrations and a lower triglyceride-to-HDL ratio, after adjusting for covariates.",
        "Cross-sectional design.",
        "Adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms manifested similar levels of dyslipidemia as healthy youth. Future studies examining the prospective trajectories of depressive symptoms and lipid concentrations are needed to determine the point at which dyslipidemia emerges in the course of MDD, and the mechanism of the association that imparts increased CVD risk for depressed youth."
