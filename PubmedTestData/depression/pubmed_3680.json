        "Measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic screening and ongoing assessment of symptoms, side effects, and adherence to adjust treatments as needed based on these factors. Studies show MBC leads to improved outcomes for depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In fact, MBC may reduce the chances of developing TRD, as it leads to optimized treatment strategies based on symptom changes and compliance. There are many rating scales available for monitoring depressive symptoms, side effects, and adherence. These rating scales can be used in a variety of clinical settings to help guide treatment decisions, including depression treatment decisions."
