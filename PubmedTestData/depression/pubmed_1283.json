        "Twenty-nine papers met inclusion criteria. Cognitive-behavioural therapy was superior to control conditions with larger effects in studies restricted to participants with depressive disorder (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.31, P<0.001) than in studies of participants with depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06, P = 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that CBT was not superior to other psychotherapies.",
