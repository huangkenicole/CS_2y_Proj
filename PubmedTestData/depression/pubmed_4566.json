        "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is one of the most effective and minimally invasive treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of rTMS in patients with TRD remains unclear. In recent years, the pathogenesis of depression has been closely associated with chronic inflammation and microglia are believed to play an important role in chronic inflammation. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) plays an important role in microglial neuroinflammatory regulation. In this study, we investigated the changes in peripheral soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) before and after rTMS treatment in patients with TRD.",
        "Twenty-six patients with TRD were enrolled in this frequency (10\u00a0Hz) rTMS study. Depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and serum sTREM2 concentrations were measured at baseline and the end of the 6-week rTMS treatment.",
        "This study showed that rTMS ameliorated depressive symptoms and partially improved cognitive dysfunction in TRD. However, rTMS treatment did not alter serum sTREM2 levels.",
        "This is the first sTREM2 study in patients with TRD who underwent rTMS treatment. These results suggest that serum sTREM2 may not be relevant for the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of rTMS in patients with TRD. Future studies should confirm the present findings using a larger patient sample and a sham rTMS procedure, as well as CSF sTREM2. Furthermore, a longitudinal study should be conducted to clarify the effects of rTMS on sTREM2 levels."
