        "Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Biological cardiac risk factors are already elevated in depressed patients without existing CVD. The purpose of this exploratory trial was to examine whether treating Major Depression (MD) with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is associated with improvements in cardiac risk biomarkers and whether depressive symptom severity at baseline moderates treatment effects.",
        "Eighty antidepressant-free patients with MD were randomly assigned to CBT or waiting list (WL). Biological outcomes included long-term recordings (24-h, daytime, nighttime) of heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure, as well as inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-<i>\u03b1</i>. A sample of 40 age- and sex-matched non-clinical controls was also involved to verify biological alterations in MD at study entry.",
        "Compared to WL, CBT was associated with a significant increase in overall HRV, as indexed by the 24-h and daytime HRV triangular index, as well as trend improvements in 24-h low-frequency HRV and daytime systolic blood pressure. Self-rated depressive symptom severity moderated (or tended to moderate) improvements in CBT for 24-h and daytime heart rate and several indices of HRV (especially daytime measures). Inflammatory treatment effects were not observed.",
        "CBT increased overall HRV in patients with MD. Initially more depressed patients showed the most pronounced cardiovascular improvements through CBT. These exploratory findings may provide new insights into the biological effects of psychological treatment against depression and must be confirmed through future research."
