        "Anxiety-depressive disorders are more common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are strongly associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a wellvalidated diagnostic tool for screening of anxiety-depression disorders. The SYNTAX score (SS) is the angiographic scoring system and is commonly used to evaluate the severity and complexity of CAD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the HADS and SS.",
        "The HADS questionnaire was filled in by subjects before the coronary angiography procedure. Biochemical, clinical and echocardiographic parameters, and SS were evaluated in all patients. Patients were assessed using the HADS. The patients were divided into two groups according to the SS [\u2265 23: high SYNTAX score group (HSSG), < 23 low].",
        "The HADS scale was significantly higher in HSSG (24.8 \u00b1 10.7 vs 11.3 \u00b1 6.4 <i>p</i> < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding laboratory parameters. On multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and the HADS were independent predictors of high SYNTAX score.",
        "In our study, we found that diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and the HADS were independent predictors of a higher SS."
