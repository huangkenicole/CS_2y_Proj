        "Forty-four percent of adolescent girls who had been screened for absence of psychiatric disorder reported depressive symptoms on a structured interview. Girls reporting symptoms were assigned to a depression group and compared to those who were free of depressive symptoms on behavioral and neuropsychological measures to determine if there were meaningful differences in cognition, behavior and motivation/self-perception between groups.",
        "Adolescent girls were randomly selected from local schools to participate in a study of neuropsychological development in adolescence. Those who volunteered and whose parents reported them to be free of psychiatric disorders were enrolled and completed a battery of behavioral, neuropsychological and motivation/self-perception measures.",
        "The depressed group showed more behavioral problems, evaluated themselves as less competent, showed more extrinsic motivational orientation, had lower IQ and differed on a measure of visual spatial perception.",
        "The frequency of subclinical depression is high in adolescent girls, even when parents report no psychiatric/emotional problems. The increase in problem behaviors and extrinsic motivation, as well as the decrease in feelings of self-worth suggest that this group may benefit from intervention. Poorer performance on a measure of visual spatial perception needs further investigation to confirm its association with depression and understand its relationship to depressive symptoms."
