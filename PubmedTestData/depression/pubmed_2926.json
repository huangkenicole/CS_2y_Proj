        "Co-occurring symptoms in depressed people currently in a relationship are sometimes considered to be due to interpersonal variables like dyadic adjustment, or intrapersonal factors such as a lack of dispositional mindfulness. Recent theories of emotional distress have, however, proposed that metacognitive beliefs could be a better link between these frequently co-occurring symptoms in major depression.",
        "In a French sample of depressed inpatients currently in a relationship (n=30), we conducted a mediation analysis to assess whether the score of the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 mediated the relation between on the one side the Beck depression inventory and on the other side the dyadic adjustment scale, the Beck anxiety inventory, and the five facets mindfulness questionnaire.",
        "By using a multiple linear regression and the Sobel test, we found that the Metacognitions Questionnaire fully mediated the association of depression severity with both anxiety and the affectionate expression of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and partially mediated that of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire with depression severity.",
        "These results obtained in a clinical sample gave support for the mediating role of dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs on some aspects of depressive symptomatology, as well as the likely metacognitive nature of important dispositional mindfulness facets. Limitations of this study are discussed, including its cross-sectional design as well as its sample size."
