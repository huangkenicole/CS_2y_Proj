        "To evaluate the effect of a forest experience on the levels of depression of alcoholics.",
        "Prior to the study, 92 alcoholics were divided into treatment and control groups. During the summer of 2009, the treatment group participated in a series of forest therapy programs, while the control group followed their normal daily routines. Both groups were re-tested upon completion of the program by the treatment group and the depression levels compared.",
        "There was a significant improvement in the depression level of alcoholics who had participated in the forest camp program (treatment group). Those participants in their 40s who had severe levels of depression at the beginning of the program showed the most significant improvement during the program experience.",
        "The forest therapy camp experience can considerably reduce and ameliorate the depression levels of alcoholics."
