        "Current studies suggest that improvement of depressive symptoms after 2 weeks of treatment could predict the subsequent response. The aim of our study was to compare the predictive effect of early improvement (EI) after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment in patients who had failed to respond to previous antidepressant treatments (\u22651 unsuccessful antidepressant trial).",
        "Seventy-one subjects were treated (\u22654 weeks) with various antidepressants chosen according to the judgment of attending psychiatrists. We used three definitions of EI (MADRS reduction \u226520, 25, 30%) at both time points. Areas under curve (AUC) were calculated to compare predictive effect of EI.",
        "We found lower MADRS scores in weeks 1 and 2 in responders (\u226550% reduction of MADRS, n=35) compared to nonresponders. AUCs of MADRS reduction for response prediction at week 1 and 2 were not significantly different (0.73 vs 0.8; p=0.24).",
        "The results indicate that improvement of depressive symptoms in the treatment of resistant patients may occur after the first week of treatment. The predictive potential might be comparable to that found after the second week of antidepressant intervention and be clinically meaningful."
