        "Depression is a common, but treatable, source of suffering, excess disability, and caregiver strain in late life. It is important to take a long-term view of the treatment of late-life depression because of the high risk for relapse, recurrence, and chronic illness. Elderly patients with medical and neurological illness or bereavement-related depressions also merit greater attention. Recent data highlight several important caveats: (a) the role of medical and psychosocial factors in the course of major depression; (b) variability in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment response; (c) need for additional studies of syndromal and subsyndromal depression in primary and long-term care facilities, particularly in patients > 75 years of age; and (d) importance of continuation and maintenance treatment to maintain quality of life and to lower the risk for chronic illness. Nortriptyline, desipramine, and the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), paroxetine and sertraline, are preferred pharmacotherapy for short-term and long-term treatment. The newer SSRIs should be further studied in controlled trials of elderly depressed patients, including those > 75 years and those with medical or neurological illness. Psychotherapy also appears to be of major importance in successful outcome but, as does pharmacotherapy, merits further controlled investigation in both short- and long-term clinical trials."
