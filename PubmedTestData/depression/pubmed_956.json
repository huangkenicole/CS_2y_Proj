      "AbstractText": [
        "A course in coping with depression was reported to have documented effects in terms of shortening periods of depression. An economic evaluation of the course was conducted.",
        "The estimate of medical effect derives from a randomized controlled trial in 155 subjects with depression. On average subjects in the intervention group improved 3-4 points more on the Beck Depression Inventory than subjects in the control group. A value estimate is provided for this effect given what is known about the weight that society places on severity of illness and effect of treatment when prioritising among patient groups. The value estimate is compared with the costs of the course.",
        "It is estimated that if 200 people take the course, the improvements in quality of life for all these people taken together may be regarded as equally valuable and worthy of priority as an intervention that provides an extra life year to one person. The cost of giving the course to 200 people is estimated at USD 45,000-60,000. This is within the limits of what society is generally willing to pay in order to gain life years. Because of possible reductions in sick leave, societal net costs may be modest."
