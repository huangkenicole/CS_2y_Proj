        "Nurses commonly observe more depression than is diagnosed and treated in nursing homes. Accordingly, we aimed to describe the clinical features of untreated nursing home residents whom nurses identify as depressed and to compare nurse ratings of depressed nursing home residents with ratings from direct interviews and patient self-reports.",
        "Cross-sectional survey followed by semi-structured diagnostic interviews of depressed patients and their nurses.",
        "A large academic, multi-level, long-term care facility.",
        "Thirty-seven patients aged 74-99 (mean age 88.4) whom nurses identified as having daily symptoms of depression. Subjects had Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores > 10 (mean score 21.2), were not acutely or terminally ill, and were able to participate in an interview.",
        "DSM-III-R mood diagnoses and separate ratings of interviews with nurses and patients using the Cornell Scale for Depression.",
        "Nurses observed daily symptoms of depression in 110 of 495 (22%) long-term care residents on units not reserved for advanced dementia. Of these 110 patients, 58 (53%) were not receiving antidepressants. Of 37 patients eligible for interviews, nine met criteria for major depression, 20 met criteria for another non-major depression diagnosis, and eight did not have a diagnosable mood disorder. Cornell scale ratings derived exclusively from interviews of nurses were similar across the three diagnostic groups (12.5, 9.9, and 9.5, respectively; P = .31; mean 10.5), whereas Cornell scale ratings from patient interviews differed among groups (15.9, 6.9, and 4.1, respectively; P < .001; mean 8.4). Correlation between nurse Cornell ratings and patient Cornell ratings was poor (r = .27), especially for patients with non-major forms of depression (r = -.20). MMSE and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) scores were similar in the three groups.",
        "Nurses frequently observed symptoms of depression in a long-term care setting, and many symptomatic patients were not being treated with antidepressants. In these patients, nurse-derived symptom ratings did not vary across DSM-III-R diagnostic categories and correlated poorly with ratings from direct patient interviews. These findings suggest that nurse caregivers may contribute important diagnostic information about non-major depression and raise questions about the application of standard diagnostic categories to late-life depression in the nursing home."
