      "AbstractText": [
        "Clinicians, policy makers, and health care administrators are attempting to improve depression outcomes in the primary care setting. Despite positive evidence about the efficacy of self-help materials and psychoeducational interventions, use of educational materials designed for the primary care patient are receiving little attention in present depression initiatives. The present study describes the use and evaluation of three educational materials by depressed primary care patients.",
        "As a part of a randomized control trial, depressed primary care patients were identified by primary care physicians and randomized to a clinical trial exploring a new method of treating depression. Patients assigned to the new method of treatment received a package of educational materials at the time of the baseline interview. These materials included two brief interactive booklets (medication booklet, behavioral health booklet) and a short video. The present analysis concerns data obtained from 108 intervention patients in a telephone survey conducted 1 week after they received the package of educational materials.",
        "Approximately three quarters of the subjects reported that they read or viewed all of the educational products. The majority rated the products as somewhat to significantly helpful: medication booklet 81%; behavioral health booklet 82%; and video 69%. Previously reported results include findings of significantly better medication adherence and improved clinical outcomes by patients with major depression who received a primary care intervention that included the educational products discussed in this paper.",
        "Educational materials may play a significant role in improving depression treatment outcomes in the primary care setting."
