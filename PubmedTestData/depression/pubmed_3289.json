        "Comorbidity of some anxiety disorders and depression were examined in order to compare their statistical closeness.",
        "Patients treated in an out-patient care center for psychiatric disorders and/or family medicine were recruited. Persons that have anxiety and depressive symptoms as a consequence of somatic illnesses or consequence of other psychiatric disorders were excluded. Disorders were diagnosed a with diagnostic questionnaire based on Schedule for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), version 2.0, according to ICD-10 criteria. Analyses include selected disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, social phobia and depression.",
        "104 patients were included. 35 of them (33.7%) had anxiety disorders, 13 persons (12.5%) have depression. Analyses show that in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, depression occurred at least twice as often as in the remaining patients (odds ratio = 7.1), while in patients with agoraphobia the occurrence of panic disorder increased at least by 2.88 times (odds ratio = 11.9). In other disorders the odds ratios was greater than 1, but the differences were not statistically significant.",
        "Depression/generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia/panic disorder were shown to be statistically closer than other disorders."
