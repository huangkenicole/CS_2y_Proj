        "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders. Aside from tremor, patients may exhibit other motor features as well as non-motor\u00a0features, including neuropsychiatric symptoms. The cerebellum and cerebellar connections are thought to play a\u00a0key role in the pathophysiology of ET. Cognitive and affective disturbances can occur in the context of cerebellar disease. Our aim was to study the prevalence and clinical correlates of alexithymia and its relationship to depression and anxiety in ET patients and control subjects (CS).",
        "We enrolled 100 ET patients and 100 age- and gender-matched\u00a0CS. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the Beck depression inventory-II\u00a0and the Beck anxiety inventory were administered.",
        "Alexithymia levels were significantly higher in ET patients than CS (respective mean TAS-20 scores\u00a0=\u00a050.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.79 vs. 44.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.51, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\u00a0 There were robust associations between alexithymia, depressive symptoms, and anxiety but, after excluding the ET patients and the CS who had moderate or severe depression or who had moderate or severe anxiety, the total alexithymia score remained significantly higher in the ET than the CS group (46.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.19 vs. 41.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.79, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01).",
        "This study suggests that prevalence of alexithymia is significantly higher in ET patients. Alexithymia might be another non-motor\u00a0neuropsychiatric symptom of the disease.\u00a0 Further studies are needed to confirm and expand upon our findings."
