        "Physical exercise has been extensively researched as a therapeutic option for treatment of major depression.",
        "In a randomized controlled trial, we analyze the effects of aerobic physical exercise as an add-on strategy for treatment of severe depressed inpatients. The exercise has a \"Dose\" of 16.5 kcal/kg/week, three times a week during all the hospitalization.",
        "Our preliminary results show that there is no significant difference in scores of Hamilton in the second week between groups (Mean[SD]=8.2[5.96] \u00d7 11.18[5.03], p=0.192). However, there is a significant reduction in Hamilton scores of patients in exercise group at discharge (Mean[SD]=5.93[4.46] \u00d7 9.45[3.56], p=0.041). Regarding Quality of Life (QoL), no significant difference were found between groups in the second week in physical domain (Mean[SD]=56.98[8.96] \u00d7 54.54[9.18], p=0.511) and psychological domain (Mean[SD]=50.88[13.88] \u00d7 42.04[12.42], p=0.106). However, there is a significant difference in psychological domain (Mean[SD]=55.88[9.92] v 41.66[13.04], p=0.004) and a trend but no statistical significance in the physical (Mean[SD]=58.80[9.14] \u00d7 52.12[8.70], p=0.07) at discharge.",
        "Many patients receive different treatment strategies, like ECT (1 patient at exercise group \u00d7 3 at control group). Other limitation is the small number of participants included until this moment.",
        "Our preliminary results suggest that physical exercise could be a feasible and effective add-on strategy for treatment of severe depressed inpatients, improving their depressive symptoms and QoL."
