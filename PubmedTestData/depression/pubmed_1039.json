        "Many aspects of the treatment for adolescent depression are still uncertain. However, our body of knowledge continues to accumulate, and our approaches continue to be refined. When we remember that 40 years ago the field was still arguing about the existence of depression in youth, it is clear that significant progress has been made. Recent controversies have provided another opportunity to step back and re-evaluate. Given the chronicity, morbidity, and mortality associated with adolescent depression, the risks of doing nothing are too great. Evidence-based research has provided us with some direction during this unsettling time. After careful reviews, the major professional organizations representing pediatric medicine and psychiatry all support the continued use of SSRI antidepressant medications but emphasize close monitoring. The debates also have heightened interest in effective psychotherapy approaches, particularly CBT and IPT. Given the risk for suicidality in depressed adolescents, assessment and management of safety concerns remain critical, regardless of medication usage. Above all, it is most important that we remain hopeful about our ability to guide adolescents and families through the struggles with depression toward recovery."
