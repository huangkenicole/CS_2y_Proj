        "Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has long been viewed as an efficacious treatment for depression, with a large number of published studies allowing its efficacy and utility to be considered closely.",
        "We review original studies and the one published meta-analysis of controlled efficacy trials, examining acute-phase and prophylactic studies, comparison studies with cognitive behaviour therapy, and studies evaluating its efficacy in combination with pharmacotherapy.",
        "We highlight difficulties in evaluating any psychotherapy, particularly when tested as having universal application for varying depressive conditions, but do identify circumstances where IPT may have specific salience.",
        "As for other treatments, IPT is unlikely to be a universal therapy for depression. This review offers suggestions as to where its preferential utility may lie, and argues for modified research paradigms to assist definition of its therapeutic niche."
