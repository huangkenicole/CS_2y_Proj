        "In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended routine depression screening for individuals aged 13 and above. Questionnaire-based screening will likely increase treatment in patients with milder symptoms. Although professional groups who develop clinical practice guidelines recognize the importance of considering the risks and benefits of interventions, no official mandate exists for a stepped-care approach. Physical activity warrants increased consideration in guidelines, given the optimal risk/benefit profile and the increasing evidence of efficacy for the treatment and prevention of depression. The aim of the current study was to evaluate clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder, specifically the recommendation of physical activity and adherence to a stepped-care approach. Authors searched three databases to identify treatment guidelines for depression. Guidelines were reviewed on the following domains regarding recommendation of physical activity: (a) front-line intervention, (b) explicit but not front-line recommendation, (c) inexplicit recommendation, (d) no mention, (e) adherence to a stepped-care approach, and (f) presentation of empirical support for their recommendation. Seventeen guidelines met inclusion criteria. Four guidelines recommended physical activity as a front-line intervention, two did not mention physical activity, eleven made some mention of physical activity, seven presented evidence to support their recommendation, and seven employed a stepped-care approach. The majority of guidelines did not use a stepped-care approach and varied greatly in their inclusion of physical activity as a recommended intervention for mild to moderate depression. Implications for practice, research, and policy are discussed."
