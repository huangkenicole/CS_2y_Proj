        "This article reviews the role of psychotherapy in management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Meta-analyses of randomized trials show that psychotherapy has a positive therapeutic benefit in TRD. There is less evidence that one type of psychotherapy approach is superior to another. However, more trials have examined cognitive-based therapies than other forms of psychotherapy. Also reviewed is the potential combination of psychotherapy modalities and medication/somatic therapies as an approach to TRD. There is significant interest in ways that psychotherapy modalities could be combined with medication/somatic therapies to harness a state of enhanced neural plasticity and improve longer-term outcomes in mood disorders."
