        "Depression is characterized by symptoms like disturbance in behavior, cognition and mood. This is commonly known to affect people aged 60 years and above especially those who are also afflicted with illnesses. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among the elderly in a tertiary care centre in Wilayah Persekutuan. A cross sectional study design was done. Stratified cluster sampling method was used to select the respondents. All elderly patients were selected from the orthopaedic, surgical, gynaecology and medical wards in a government hospital in Wilayah Persekutuan. A 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale questionnaire was used as a screening instrument. Out of the 246 elderly subjects, 198 were interviewed giving a response rate of 80.5%. The results showed that 54% of the elderly respondents were found to have depressive symptoms. Age (p=0.022), sex (p=0.008), ethnicity (p=0.022) and functional disabilities in bathing (p=0.001), grooming (p=0.007), dressing (p= 0.007), using the toilet (p=0.002), transferring from bed to chair and back (p=0.000), mobility (p=0.000) and climbing stairs (p=0.000) were all found to be significantly associated with depression among the elderly respondents. The outcome of this study will have an important impact on the implementation of the health policy for the elderly patients admitted to hospitals."
