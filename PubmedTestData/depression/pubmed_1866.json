        "Whether melancholic depression is a distinct syndrome or not has long been debated. There are few studies providing information about the epidemiology of melancholic depression. In this study, we investigate the incidence rates, overall as well as by gender and age of onset of melancholic depression according to Taylor and Fink and corresponding DSM-IV disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD) with melancholic specifier, MDD with psychotic features, MDD with postpartum debut and bipolar depression in the Lundby population. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The incidence rate of melancholic depression was 0.48 (CI 0.36-0.61) per 1000 person-years under risk. The rates of the corresponding DSM-IV disorders were as follows: MDD with melancholic specifier 0.38 (CI 0.27-0.49), MDD with psychotic features 0.13 (CI 0.07-0.21), MDD with postpartum debut 0.02 (CI 0.00-0.06) and bipolar depression 0.04 (CI 0.01-0.10). Females had a significantly higher incidence rate, with a peak in age group 40-49, in melancholic depression according to Taylor and Fink and MDD with melancholic specifier. There was no gender difference in incidence rates of MDD with psychotic features or bipolar depression. The diagnoses were set in retrospect and the number of subjects with MDD with postpartum debut and bipolar depression was low. Incidence of melancholia was low in the Lundby Study. There was a female preponderance to become melancholically depressed in line with research on undifferentiated depression."
