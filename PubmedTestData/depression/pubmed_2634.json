        "The aim of this study was to determine the influence of spirituality to depression and to determine the moderating effect of occupational stress among Registered Nurses.",
        "Depression is a major contributor to the global burden of disease and it is influenced by several factors. Spirituality can be a protective factor against depression. However, it remains underexplored among nurses who experience several precipitating factors of depression, including occupational stress.",
        "Cross-sectional, predictive-correlational study.",
        "From August - December 2017, 242 purposively selected nurses from selected tertiary hospitals completed a four-part survey packet composed of the \"robotfoto,\" Spirituality Assessment Scale, Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, and Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Structural equation\u00a0modelling analysed the influence of spirituality to depression, while multigroup analysis determined the moderating effect of occupational stress.",
        "\"Personal faith, spiritual contentment, and religious practice\" negatively influenced depression, generating a good model. Occupational stress significantly moderated the influence of spirituality to depression, with a significant inverse U-shaped effect for both \"personal faith\" and \"religious practice\" and a non-significant decreasing effect for \"spiritual contentment\".",
        "The stress-moderated model of the influence of spirituality to depression highlights three significant points. First, there is a need to develop individualized, spiritually based interventions based on the spiritual needs of Registered Nurses. Second, policies geared towards positive spirituality in the workplace and spiritual support to nurses must be explored. Finally, nurse managers must identify the sources of occupational stress and implement stress-reducing programmes in the workplace."
