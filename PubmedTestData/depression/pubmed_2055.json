        "To examine predictors and moderators of response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication treatments for binge-eating disorder (BED).",
        "108 BED patients in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial testing CBT and fluoxetine treatments were assessed prior, throughout, and posttreatment. Demographic factors, psychiatric and personality disorder comorbidity, eating disorder psychopathology, psychological features, and 2 subtyping methods (negative affect, overvaluation of shape/weight) were tested as predictors and moderators for the primary outcome of remission from binge eating and 4 secondary dimensional outcomes (binge-eating frequency, eating disorder psychopathology, depression, and body mass index). Mixed-effects models analyzed all available data for each outcome variable. In each model, effects for baseline value and treatment were included with tests of both prediction and moderator effects.",
        "Several demographic and clinical variables significantly predicted and/or moderated outcomes. One demographic variable signaled a statistical advantage for medication only (younger participants had greater binge-eating reductions), whereas several demographic and clinical variables (lower self-esteem, negative affect, and overvaluation of shape/weight) signaled better improvements if receiving CBT. Overvaluation was the most salient predictor/moderator of outcomes. Overvaluation significantly predicted binge-eating remission (29% of participants with vs. 57% of participants without overvaluation remitted). Overvaluation was especially associated with lower remission rates if receiving medication only (10% vs. 42% for participants without overvaluation). Overvaluation moderated dimensional outcomes: Participants with overvaluation had significantly greater reductions in eating disorder psychopathology and depression levels if receiving CBT. Overvaluation predictor/moderator findings persisted after controlling for negative affect.",
        "Our findings have clinical utility for prescription of CBT and medication and implications for refinement of the BED diagnosis."
