        "Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have fewer treatment options and worse prognoses than those without TRD. Although the etiology or pathophysiology of TRD remains unclear, certain clinical variables have been found to be related to its severity and prognosis. Therefore, 1151 patients with recurrent depression were recruited from the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) and their depressive symptoms were assessed by using the doctor-rating assessment questionnaire. Then, the differences between patients with or without TRD were compared by parametric or nonparametric tests and the risk factors for TRD were explored by logistic regression. The results showed there were differences in clinical variables between patients with and without TRD. Additionally, we found depression with more somatic symptoms had a higher risk for TRD. Further analysis by stepwise logistic regression showed that age, gender, religious belief, drinking habit, the total course of depression, the number of hospitalizations, characteristics of seasonal episode remission, depressed mood, hypersexuality, emotionally incoherent psychotic symptoms, psychomotor agitation, respiratory system symptoms and history of suicide attempts were strongly associated with TRD. So, it is crucial for clinicians to identify these clinical features and adjust treatments timely."
