        "Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is characterized by a high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence. These disorders are a source of great impairment in everyday functioning, as well as important risk factors for the emergence of later psychotic disorders. Impairment in daily and social functioning as well as loss of IQ throughout growth are also are well-established correlates of the VCFS. This study aimed to confirm the high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. The second objective was to ascertain the correlation between anxious and depressive symptoms and the decline in adaptive and cognitive functioning. A total of 73 children and adolescents with VCFS (mean age 11.9 years) underwent psychiatric evaluation. Subjects were further divided into four age groups: ages 6-9, 9-12, 12-15 and 15-18 years. Assessments measuring intelligence, anxious and depressive symptoms, and adaptation skills reported by parents were submitted to a subsample of 62 children (mean age 12.2 years); 62.2 % of the sample showed an anxiety disorder, specific phobia being the most represented at all ages. Lifetime depression concerned 27 % of the sample, peaking at age 12-15 years. Anxious and depressive symptoms and low IQ were significantly associated with low adaptive functioning. Anxiety and depression are common disorders in children and adolescents with VCFS and have a great impact on adaptive functioning. Clinicians should pay great attention to diagnosis and treatment."
