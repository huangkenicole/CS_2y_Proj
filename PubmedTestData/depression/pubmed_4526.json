        "To determine the accuracy of 12 previously validated short versions of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to detect major depressive disorder (MDD) in a high-risk population with and without global cognitive impairment.",
        "Cross-sectional study.",
        "Five hospitals, Western Sweden.",
        "Older adults (age \u226570 years, <i>n</i> = 60) assessed at a home visit 1 year after hospital care in connection with suicide attempt.",
        "Depression symptoms were rated using the established 15-item GDS. Eleven short GDS versions identified by a recent systematic review were derived from this administered version. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) for the identification of MDD diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were obtained for each version. The Youden Index optimal criterion was used to determine the appropriate cutoffs. Analyses were repeated after stratification by cognitive status (Mini Mental State Examination score \u226424 and >24) for the best performing GDS short versions and the established 15-item GDS.",
        "The 7-item GDS according to Broekman <i>et al</i>. (), with a cutoff 3, was the most accurate among the 12 short versions (AUC 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.80-1.00), identifying MDD with sensitivity 88% and specificity 81%. The cutoff score remained consistent in the presence of global cognitive impairment, which was not the case for the standardized 15-item GDS.",
        "The Broekman 7-item GDS had high accuracy to detect MDD in this prospective clinical cohort at high risk for MDD. Further testing of GDS short versions in diverse settings is required."
