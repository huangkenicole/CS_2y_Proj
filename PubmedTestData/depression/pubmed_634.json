        "Depression is associated with cognitive deficits and changes in the brain. Major depression is often associated with cognitive problems; however, there are only a few studies that have focused on the systematic use of cognitive remediation in depression. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of computerized cognitive remediation in depressed patients with cognitive dysfunction. Patients (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200920) with depression were randomly assigned to the active or control group. The active intervention (computerized cognitive remediation) comprised 12 sessions focused on the remediation of attention and executive functions through the CogniPlus software. All participants completed neuropsychological testing before and after the intervention. A mixed-design analysis of variance revealed a significant time\u2009\u00d7\u2009group interaction in the attention and planning task, on the Beck Depression Inventory and on the Shifting, Emotional Control and Initiating sub-scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult. The results showed that patients undergoing cognitive remediation improved in domains related to attention and executive functions and scored significantly lower on the Beck Depression Inventory. The findings provide some evidence that cognitive remediation could be an efficient approach to dealing with cognitive deficits in depression."
