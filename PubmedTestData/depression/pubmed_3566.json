        "To evaluate the effects of major and minor depression during pregnancy on the maternal and neonatal immunities.",
        "Peripheral venous blood from depressed women and cord venous blood from their neonates taken simultaneously and immediately after parturition were used. The serum levels of immunoglobulins IgG, IgM and IgA and complements C3 and C4 were determined through single radial immunodiffusion with the kits manufactured by the Biogen company (Mashhad, Iran). To reduce error, all the ring diameters were measured by one experimenter unaware of the study groups. The blood leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte percentage were determined with a H1 counter and for more accuracy also with a Hycel counter.",
        "The immune parameters of depressed women were not significantly different from controls. The lymphocyte counts in neonates of women with major and minor depression were increased, whereas ratio of the cord blood level of IgG to the maternal blood level of IgG in neonates of women with major depression were decreased compared to controls.",
        "Major depression during pregnancy reduces the prenatal transfer of IgG from mother to neonate. The low prenatal transfer of IgG may have clinical significance, because it can compromise immune competence in neonates."
