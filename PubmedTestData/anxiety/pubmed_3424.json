        "The efficacy of antidepressants is well established in major depressions, especially those with melancholic features. However, some anxiolytics also appear to have antidepressant properties at least for outpatients. 118 outpatients (25 males, 93 females, age: 18-60) with major depression according to DSM-III criteria, neither melancholic nor suicidal, reaching at least 27 on Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and 19 on Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS) accepted to participate this double blind study carried out by 15 G.P.s coordinated by 3 psychiatrists. After a one week placebo wash-out-single-blind period, they were randomly, double blind, assigned to one of the two following groups: PR treated with prazepam (30-60 mg), a benzodiazepine anxiolytic or CL treated clomipramine, an imipramine antidepressant (75-150 mg). Patients were evaluated at days 0, 7, 14, and 28, using MADRS, HARS, Clinical Global Impression and Hopkins symptoms check list 58. In addition, G.P.s had to meet monthly for a case discussion group.",
        "groups were comparable at day 0. A highly significant improvement of MADRS and HARS scores (p less than 0.001) was observed in the total population. For the completer population evolution was also significantly positive in all the parameters studied but, considering MADRS and HSCL scores, a difference in favor of CL is observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
