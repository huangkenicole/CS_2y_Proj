        "Anxiety is the most common mental health problem worldwide. Epidemiological studies show that sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, affect \u223c50% of individuals with anxiety, and that insufficient sleep can instigate or further exacerbate it. This review outlines brain mechanisms underlying sleep and anxiety, by addressing recent human functional/structural imaging studies on brain networks underlying the anxiogenic impact of sleep loss, and the beneficial effect of sleep on these brain networks. We discuss recent developments from human molecular imaging studies that highlight the role of specific brain neurotransmitter mechanisms, such as the adenosinergic receptor system, on anxiety, arousal, and sleep. This review further discusses frontline sleep interventions aimed at enhancing sleep in individuals experiencing anxiety, such as nonbenzodiazepines/antidepressants, lifestyle and sleep interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Notwithstanding therapeutic success, up to \u223c30% of individuals with anxiety can be nonresponsive to frontline treatments. Thus, we address novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that can enhance electroencephalographic slow waves, and might help alleviate sleep and anxiety symptoms. Collectively, these findings contribute to an emerging biological framework that elucidates the interrelationship between sleep and anxiety, and highlight the prospect of slow wave sleep as a potential therapeutic target for reducing anxiety."
