        "This study aimed to assess the prevalence, correlates, and significant associated factors of anxiety among patients with stroke. A cross-sectional, correlation design was utilized. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale was used to detect and assess the severity of anxiety and depression among mentally well patients at general hospital settings. Among the 226 patients with stroke, 45.6% had clinically significant levels of anxiety to be considered as a definite case. Having a short duration since the stroke onset, being a definite case of depression, being unable to perform self-care activities, having an insufficient monthly income, and having visual problems due to stroke were the significantly associated factors. The high prevalence of anxiety among patients with stroke highlights the need for interventions of early detection and management to enhance recovery. Patients who have any of the significant traits predicted post-stroke anxiety required special attention."
