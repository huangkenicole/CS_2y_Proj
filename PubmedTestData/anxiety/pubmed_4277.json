        "This study investigated the effect of varying degrees of therapist presence on outcome measures of a test anxiety program on systematic desensitization. Three treatments, which included face-to-face administration by a therapist, some therapist involvement, and fully automated administration were compared to a waiting list control group. It was found that all three treatments were effective when compared to the control group in terms of reduction of reported anxiety as measured by the STABS. It was noted that clients who used the automated program were more likely to terminate prematurely. It was concluded that, while all of the treatments may be effective in a laboratory setting, the presence of a counselor would seem to be important for the use of this type of program in a service agency."
