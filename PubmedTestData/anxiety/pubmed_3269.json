        "The aim of this article is to present a qualitative examination of the phenomenon of uncertainty in patients awaiting CABG surgery. Cardiac symptoms are presented as an antecedent to uncertainty and both positive and negative outcomes of uncertainty are discussed. Semi-structured interview questions, based on Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory, were developed to investigate the experience of waiting for CABG surgery and identify what patients were doing: to make their cardiac symptoms more manageable, to relieve their own anxiety while waiting, and to identify why patients felt having CABG surgery would benefit them. Telephone interviews were conducted with a self-selected sample of 25 participants. The qualitative results presented are part of a larger multimethod study examining the psychosomatic experience of waiting for CABG surgery. Data collected from telephone interviews were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Content analysis identified three conceptual categories: i) taking responsibility; ii) getting my life back; and iii) getting it over with. Strategies associated with each of these categories, the consequences of the strategies, and factors that facilitate or constrain their use were also identified. Participants were actively trying to lessen the impact of their cardiac symptoms and were very aware of their own bodies and what actions would exacerbate symptoms or relieve symptoms if they occurred. Participants envisioned physical and psychological improvements for post-CABG surgery. Participants also identified actions they took to limit their anxiety while waiting. Anxiety levels were influenced by family members as well as stories they had heard from friends, family, or acquaintances who had also experienced CABG. This study concluded that the lengthy waits experienced by some patients can create significant psychological disturbance including anxiety and uncertainty about the future. In addition, patient symptom status requires attentive monitoring."
