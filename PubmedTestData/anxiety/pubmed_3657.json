        "To evaluate recent studies of psychosocial interventions to improve survival, health, quality of life, and somatic symptoms for patients with cancer.",
        "Survival in advanced breast cancer was not affected by group therapy in two large randomized controlled studies. However, several recent trials have shown improvements in quality of life and physical symptoms with both group and individual therapies. Specific therapies for symptomatic patient types are more likely to be efficacious than those applied to more general populations. There continues to be a predominance of studies in breast cancer.",
        "The experience and training of therapists are crucial. New therapies are targeting meaning as an approach to optimize adaptation and ameliorate distress. Effective treatment of anxiety and depression will remain the mainstay of work for the psychooncologist."
