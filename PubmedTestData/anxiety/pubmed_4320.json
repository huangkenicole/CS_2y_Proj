        "Serum cortisol and inflammatory markers may play a role in depression and anxiety, but little is known about whether various features of serum cortisol and inflammatory markers have different associations with depression and anxiety. This study examines the associations of serum cortisol and inflammatory marker features with depression and anxiety in young women with gynecologic cancer.",
        "Sixty-four young women with gynecologic cancer, aged 15-39 years, were recruited in a tertiary general hospital and a tertiary hospital specializing in oncology in China from May to December 2021. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate depression and anxiety. Blood samples were taken at 8 am, 4 pm, and 10 pm on the same day to examine the various features (average, variability, and diurnal patterns) of serum cortisol and inflammatory markers, namely C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1).",
        "Young women with gynecologic cancer who reported depression/anxiety had significantly higher average levels of serum cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 than those who did not. The dysregulations in the diurnal patterns of serum cortisol and IL-6 were associated with depression and anxiety. Serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in the depression/anxiety group at 10 pm. Depression and anxiety were associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 at each time point.",
        "This study revealed various associations of serum cortisol and inflammatory marker features with depression and anxiety in young women with gynecologic cancer. Further research is needed to understand the role of serum cortisol and inflammatory marker features in the progression of depression and anxiety."
