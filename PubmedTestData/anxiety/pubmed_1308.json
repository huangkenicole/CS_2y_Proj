        "Because anxiety is the third most common problem encountered in this Model Family Practice unit, the presentation and management of 36 randomly selected cases were reviewed. The incidence was not greater in one race, but was increased in all married females (age 25 to 35) who, despite wife or husband working, had a very low income. The foremost complaints were insomnia, headaches, and chest pain with 80% of the patients maintaing the same symptoms. The resident identified a conflict (the most frequent being marital problems) in 47% of the cases. Drug therapy was used in 86.1% with ten percent selected for symptom relief. Because there are times when an alternate to drug therapy is needed, an overview teaching series on brief psychotherapy is suggested as an appropriate part of the behavioral science curriculum in a residency program."
