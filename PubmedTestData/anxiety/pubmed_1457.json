        "Recent functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that specific brain regions might be associated with the formation of anxiety-related personality traits, which are well known to be influenced by gender. Such anxiety-related personality traits are one of the representative predisposing factors for mood and anxiety disorders, whose incidence is also known to be much influenced by gender. However, little is known about the gender differences in brain function related to anxiety-related personality traits. The aim of the present study was to examine gender-related differences in the pattern of the relationships between an anxiety-related personality trait and cerebral brain glucose metabolism. Regional brain glucose metabolism was measured using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 102 healthy subjects (65 males and 37 females). An anxiety-related trait was assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory dimension Harm Avoidance (HA). HA was negatively correlated with glucose metabolism in the anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in females but not in males. The anterior vmPFC may be a possible neural target for the prevention or therapy of emotional disorders, especially in females."
