        "This study examined the effectiveness of a newly developed transdiagnostic preventive intervention for anxiety and depressive symptoms among workers in a pre- and posttest study design.",
        "Participants were recruited from six companies and one medical clinic. The program was developed based on Unified Protocol. The outcomes were anxiety symptoms (GAD7), depressive symptoms (BDI-II), and psychological distress (K6), measured at baseline, 3-week, and 6-week follow-up. A mixed model for repeated measures was conducted for the whole sample and for a subgroup with higher psychological distress.",
        "Among 75 participants, this program showed no significant effects on improving any outcome in the whole sample, but a significant improvement of psychological distress among the high-distress subgroup.",
        "The program may be effective in improving psychological distress among those who have high symptom levels."
