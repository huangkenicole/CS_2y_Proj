        "Test anxiety comprises cognitive, physiological, and behavioral reactions due to anxiety about failure or a lower academic performance score on an exam or evaluation. This study examined the effect of self-hypnosis on reducing test anxiety among upper secondary school students using a quantitative methodology with a pre-experimental design. The prevalence of test anxiety was measured using the Friedben Test Anxiety Scale (FTAS) and students' demographic data were collected. Twenty-two 16-year-old students with moderate to high test anxiety were selected for a self-hypnosis intervention over a period of 5\u00a0weeks. The FTAS questionnaire was administered 4 times: at baseline, 3rd week, 5th week, and at follow-up (3\u00a0weeks after the intervention). Students' test anxiety differences were statistically significant across 4 time points. Self-hypnosis intervention decreased students' overall test anxiety scores and in the 3 constructs: social, cognitive, and tenseness. The outcomes indicate that self-hypnosis training can help students cope with test anxiety and should be further explored for managing test anxiety in school settings."
