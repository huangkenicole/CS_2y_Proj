        "Interoceptive exposure (IE) is a behavioral intervention that reduces anxiety sensitivity and distress associated with somatic sensations. In this discussion, we describe the history, current applications and additional clinical potential of IE.",
        "We review the origins of IE and its historical application to panic disorder, as well as the accumulating evidence for transdiagnostic application to other disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias and physical disorders. Then, we discuss ways in which IE could contribute to the treatment of additional disorders.",
        "IE is well-established in the treatment of panic disorder and increasingly used to target anxiety-provoking physical sensations in other disorders. Research and clinical evidence suggests that anxiety sensitivity is present across a range of disorders, and may actually be one variation on a broader phenomenon of interoceptive sensitivity, or anxiety focused on physical sensations that have been conditioned to unpleasant emotional states. Moreover, somatic symptoms are central to the experience of most emotions and may contribute to avoidant coping, a maintenance factor for disorders of emotion. IE has potential as a transdiagnostic intervention targeting interoceptive sensitivity in disorders such as depression and eating disorders. Nevertheless, IE is underutilized by clinicians in practice. Recent research in inhibitory learning and extinction suggests strategies for maximizing the effectiveness of IE.",
        "This review is not exhaustive in nature, and systematic research on transdiagnostic applications of IE remains scarce.",
        "IE is a potentially powerful yet understudied transdiagnostic intervention."
