        "This qualitative study aimed to deeply understand the current experience of fertility information support for young breast cancer patients and to provide further evidence supporting the development of a fertility information support project.",
        "Using purposive sampling, 18 young breast cancer patients were selected for in-depth interviews from June to September 2022. Colaizzi's seven step analysis method and NVivo software were used to analyze and organize the interview data.",
        "Three themes and 10 subthemes were summarized from the interview data: Information anxiety (strong information demand, insufficient information support, information explosion, and information security); reproductive concerns (desire for fertility, anxiety about their children's health, denial of one's health, multiple burdens of emotional interweaving); and family support (the importance of good family relations, the need for a positive marital relationship).",
        "Medical staff should realize the importance of information support for young breast cancer patients and correctly identify the obstacles to insufficient information support. By establishing a fertility information support program, patients' awareness and the quality of fertility information support can be improved to reduce fertility anxiety in breast cancer patients."
