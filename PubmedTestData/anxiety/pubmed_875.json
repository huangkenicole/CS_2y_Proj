        "The menopausal transition is often accompanied by psycho-vegetative symptoms, including stress and anxiety symptoms. Identifying stress and anxiety and intervening early can have an enormous public health impact. Health care practitioners like obstetrician-gynecologists or family doctors play a critical role in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of stress and anxiety symptoms or disorders, as they often represent women's primary medical contact during the menopausal transition. However, they frequently do not feel confident in identifying and treating mental health problems. The aim of this review was to summarize current (since 2010) knowledge from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses on diagnostics and treatment options, and to provide clinical decision-making algorithms. The recent literature suggests pharmacological, (cognitive) behavioral, and complementary treatments. The choice about which one to use should be discussed with the patient."
