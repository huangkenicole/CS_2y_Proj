        "Many COVID-19 patients with low to moderate disease severity were cared for at home by family members. Caring for relatives with COVID-19 could have a psychiatric disorder for informal caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychiatric disorders of family caregivers of relatives with COVID-19, in Iran.",
        "This online survey was conducted with 350 family caregivers over 18\u00a0years from April to July 2020, which was guided by the STROBE checklist. The study survey consisted of socio-demographic items, 7-items fear of COVID-19 scale, and a 21-item version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scales.",
        "The mean (standard deviation) scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were 20 (0.40), 19.52 (0.39), and 19.72 (0.35), respectively, moreover for fear of COVID-19 was 20.33 (0.43). Of all family caregivers, 77.75%, 75%, and 80% had depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of caregivers had fear with moderate to high severity. Being younger, married, having a health-related occupation, not exercising, and high monthly salary were significant predictors of the total score of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Further, being married, having a health-related occupation, and not exercising, having comorbidity, high income, and being younger were independent predictors of fear of COVID-19 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Only 32% and 33% of the variance of total depression, anxiety, and stress, and fear of COVID-19 scores were predicted by the studied variables (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "Our study demonstrated the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in family caregivers, which requires swift and comprehensive attention from authorities."
