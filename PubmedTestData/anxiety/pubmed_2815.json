      "AbstractText": [
        "It is known that the diagnosis of breast cancer often causes anxiety and depression. Radiotherapy of the breast as an obligatory part of a\u00a0breast-conserving treatment concept can markedly increase these psychological symptoms in many, but not all patients. In this clinical observational study, we aimed at identifying cognitive, health-related and social factors that may either enhance or reduce the emergence of anxiety and depression.",
        "Using a\u00a0longitudinal study design with 25\u00a0women (mean age: 52.9\u00a0years; SD\u202f=\u200910.6; age range 29-70\u00a0years) with a\u00a0first diagnosis of nonmetastatic breast cancer, measures of anxiety, depression, situational emotional states, intelligence, and aspects of social frameworks were assessed before, during, and after radiotherapy of the breast. At 4\u00a0time-points, standard and self-constructed questionnaires were used to assess the course of anxiety and depressive symptoms across the radiotherapy intervention.",
        "We found that anxiety is highest immediately before the start of radiation therapy, while the anxiety level was lowest on the day that therapy was completed. Anxiety and depression were enhanced in women with a\u00a0lifetime history of chronic diseases at all time points of measurement. Moreover, women with high intelligence and low social support had stronger symptoms of depression than women with low intelligence and a\u00a0stable family background at some time points of measurement. The degree of anxiety was neither related to intelligence nor to social support.",
        "For the first time, we demonstrate empirical pilot data on cognitive and social modulators of anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer over the course of radiotherapy. Our results may help to optimize clinical procedures and thereby reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in these patients."
