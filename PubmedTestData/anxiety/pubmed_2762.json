        "To explore the predictive role of dispositional coping styles in determining the level of depression and anxiety among international medical students in Germany.",
        "The cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany from September 2016 to February 2017 and comprised international students studying medicine in Germany. Data were collected through an electronic survey using reliable instruments, including Major Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Problem-Focussed Styles of Coping Inventory, and a demographic sheet.",
        "Of the 122 subjects, 76(62%) were females. The overall mean age was 24.92\u00b13.58 years. In terms of region, Europe was represented by 87(71.3%) of the total. Reflective coping was found to be a health-promoting coping style predicting a low level of depression and anxiety among international medical students. Suppressive and reactive coping were recognised to be dysfunctional since these styles turned out to be relatively stronger predictors of a high degree of depression as well as anxiety. Overall, 13(10%) subjects had moderate depression and 19(16%) were experiencing severe depression. The anxiety symptoms were seen in 32(26%) subjects at moderate level and 28(23%) had severe level of anxiety.",
