        "A study has been conducted to assess the psychological effects of real-time ultrasound on the pregnant woman's attitudes and anxiety levels. A consecutive series of primiparae, fulfilling the selection criteria of obstetrically \"low risk,\" was assigned at random to two conditions of ultrasound, namely, (a) high feedback (N = 67), where the woman saw the moving fetus in utero; and (b) low feedback (N = 62), where the monitor screen was not visible and no specific feedback was provided. A third group of women was assessed following a wait period in order to compare state anxiety levels among the three groups. Attitude assessments showed consistent preultrasound-post-ultrasound change, with more uniformly positive attitudes displayed by the high-feedback group. No between-group differences in state anxiety emerged as a result of ultrasound compared with a wait control period. No differences emerged with respect to anticipatory anxiety measures. The results are considered in the context of evidence on the importance of psychological state on the course and outcome of pregnancy. It is suggested that the low-risk characteristics of this sample may have precluded effects on anxiety and it is concluded that the therapeutic potential of ultrasound warrants further study."
