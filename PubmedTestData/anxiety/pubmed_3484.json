        "The purpose of the current study was to describe anxious pregnant women's concerns about using pharmacotherapy to treat anxiety symptoms, and the relationship of such concerns to women's willingness to use pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.",
        "Between April 2011 and May 2012, 148 women who were pregnant and reported elevated anxiety symptoms, as measured by the GAD-2, completed an online survey assessing their concerns about, and willingness to use, pharmacotherapy to treat anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. Qualitative responses were coded, and linear regression was used to assess the relationship between concerns and willingness.",
        "Pregnant women with elevated anxiety symptoms reported low willingness to use pharmacotherapy to treat anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. The most common concerns reported were about negative effects on the baby or the self, and a general opposition to taking any medications during pregnancy. These concerns were significantly related to women's willingness to try pharmacotherapy (ps\u2009<\u2009.016).",
        "Our findings underscore the importance of a pregnant woman's perceptions of potential side-effects and long-term effects of pharmacotherapy, both for herself and her offspring. These results point to specific factors that may be important to address in communication with patients about pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders during pregnancy. Such an understanding may help clinicians provide more effective guidance and information about treatment options for anxiety disorders during pregnancy, and increase patients' willingness to engage in those treatments."
