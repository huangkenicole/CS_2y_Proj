        "The evidence base for the impact of digital health on musculoskeletal (MSK) outcomes is growing, but it is unclear how much digital MSK programs address pain and function in the intermediate and long term.",
        "This observational study of digital MSK program participants versus nonparticipants (n\u2009=\u20092570) examined pain, function, depression, and anxiety at 3, 6, and 12\u2009months, and health care use at 12\u2009months. The intervention group engaged in a digital MSK program that included exercise, education, and coaching for at least 3\u2009months. The nonparticipant group registered, but never started the program. We collected data in app or by emailed survey at 3, 6, and 12\u2009months after registering for the program. We conducted descriptive analyses and unadjusted and adjusted regression modeling.",
        "The odds ratio of achieving a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) in pain improvement for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.28, 3.02; p\u2009=\u2009.002) at 3\u2009months, 1.44 (95% CI: 0.91, 2.25; p\u2009=\u2009.11) at 6\u2009months, and 2.06 (95% CI: 1.38, 3.08; p\u2009=\u2009.004) at 12\u2009months in adjusted models. The odds ratio of achieving a MCID in functional improvement for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.38; p\u2009=\u2009.01) at 3\u2009months, 1.55 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.37; p\u2009=\u2009.04) at 6\u2009months, and 1.35 (95% CI: 0.89, 2.06, p\u2009=\u20090.16) at 12\u2009months in adjusted models. For those with moderate to severe depression or anxiety at baseline, we observed statistically significant lower odds of moderate to severe depression or anxiety at 3\u2009months, 6\u2009months, and 12\u2009months for the intervention versus the nonparticipant group in adjusted models (p\u2009<\u2009.05). At 12\u2009months, the percentage with invasive, imaging, and conservative services was higher for the nonparticipant versus intervention group by 5.7, 8.1, and 16.7 percentage points, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
