        "Colonoscopy is a painful procedure that causes anxiety and changes in vital signs. Pain and anxiety may cause patients to avoid colonoscopy, which is a preventive and curative healthcare service. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of virtual reality glasses on the vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation, and pain) and anxiety in patients undergoing colonoscopy. The population of the study consisted of 82 patients who underwent colonoscopy without sedation between January 2, 2020, and September 28, 2020. Post-power analysis was performed with 44 patients who agreed to participate in the study, met the inclusion criteria, and were followed up for pre- and post-tests. The experimental group participants (n = 22) watched a 360\u00b0 virtual reality video through virtual reality glasses whereas the control group participants (n = 22) underwent a standard procedure. Data were collected using a demographic characteristics questionnaire, the Visual Analog Scale-Anxiety, Visual Analog Scale-Pain, Satisfaction Evaluation Form, and monitoring of vital signs. The experimental group participants had significantly lower levels of pain, anxiety, systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate and significantly higher peripheral oxygen saturation during colonoscopy than the control group participants. The majority of the experimental group participants were satisfied with the application. Virtual reality glasses have a positive effect on vital signs and anxiety during colonoscopy."
