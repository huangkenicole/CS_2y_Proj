        "At present, simple reminiscence has been widely used in the field of neurocognitive disorders, life review/life review therapy has been widely used in the field of cancer, and both simple reminiscence and life review/life review therapy are suitable for psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety. However, the efficacy of reminiscence in treating cancer-related symptom has not been fully assessed.",
        "To evaluate the effect of reminiscence therapy (RT) on relieving cancer-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression in cancer survivals.",
        "China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, China Biomedical Database, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, EBSCO, Scopus, and Ovid databases were searched. To collect clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) on RT and cancer-related studies published from the establishment of the database to October 05, 2021. Two researchers independently evaluated the articles that met the inclusion criteria, meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.4 software.",
        "A total of 20 RCTs published in 2010 to 2021 were included, with a total of 1853 cancer patients. Meta-analysis results showed that the anxiety scale (HADS-A and HAMA and SAS) and depression scale (HADS-D and HAMD and SDS) scores of the RT group were significantly lower than those of the control group (HADS-A: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.0002; HAMA: <i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.00001; SAS: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.0010; HADS-D: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.01; HAMD: <i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.00001; SDS: <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.0001). Meta-analysis results showed that RT can improve overall quality of life of cancer patients of RT group to a certain extent hope (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.00001). Meta-analysis results showed that the scores on the hope and dignity were significantly increased, and the difference were statistically significant (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001).",
        "This review indicates that RT has significant efficacy on cancer-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression. RT for cancer survivals can effectively improve quality of life, self-hope, and self-esteem. The findings of this meta-analysis can provide direction for future symptom management research."
