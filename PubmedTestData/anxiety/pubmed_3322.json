        "High levels of anxiety during clinical practice in nursing education may interfere with learning and contribute to poor mental health. The relationship between undergraduate curriculum design and clinical practice anxiety is unknown.",
        "A descriptive, comparative research design was used to compare levels of clinical practice anxiety in third year baccalaureate nursing students in a problem-based learning (PBLP) curriculum (n=53) with those in a traditional, lecture-based (TNP) curriculum (n=42). A secondary aim of this study was to explore relationships between some of the demographic characteristics of the student sample, students' predisposition to anxiety, clinical learning experiences, and clinical practice anxiety. Students anonymously completed three electronic questionnaires including: a demographic questionnaire, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Clinical Experience Assessment Form (CEAF).",
        "The PBL and the traditional group did not significantly differ on clinical practice anxiety. The mean scores on the STAI for this sample of nursing students were higher than those previously reported for the general population of university students. Implications for nursing education: strategies aimed at reducing nursing students' clinical practice anxiety are explored."
