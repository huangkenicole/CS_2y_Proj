      "AbstractText": [
        "We assessed levels of depression, anxiety, stress, anhedonia, somatization, psychological distress, sleep, and life quality in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) after one year of containment measures started in Italy to stem the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "We consecutively enrolled 51 patients with MTLE, administering an online survey that compared the year before and after the COVID-19 propagation. We analyzed clinical data (e.g., seizure frequency, life quality) and neuropsychological assessment through Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The BDI-2 and STAI-Y scores were compared to those acquired in the same patients before the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "Comparing our population with MTLE before and after COVID-19 outbreak, we found a significant worsening in life quality (p\u202f=\u202f0.03), SSS-8 (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), BDI-2 (p\u202f=\u202f0.032), and STAI-Y scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). After one year of pandemic, 88.2% of patients obtained pathological scores at PSQI, 19.6% at SHAPS, 29.4% at IES-R. Reduction of life quality correlated with anxiety, depression, stress, and somatization. Higher levels of anhedonia correlated with stress, depression, and anxiety. Somatization correlated with depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Distress levels correlated with anxiety, somatization, and depression.",
        "We demonstrated a significant worsening of depression, anxiety, life quality, and somatization in patients with MTLE after one year of COVID-19 beginning. Concomitantly, results suggest that the pandemic had a negative impact on sleep quality, psychological distress, and anhedonia, but not on epilepsy itself."
