        "The aim of the present study was to determine levels of anxiety during the course of IVF treatment and gender differences in treatment anxiety.",
        "This was a prospective cohort study set in a university affiliated, tertiary care IVF program. 119 women and 82 men entering the clinic to undergo IVF treatment filled out questionnaires containing the Spielberger state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI) as well as further items on specific stress triggers.",
        "Women and men undergoing IVF have higher levels of anxiety than the average population in Germany. Overall, female patients show significantly higher values (mean \u00b1 SD) for state and trait anxiety (47.4 \u00b1 11.0 and 40.1 \u00b1 9.85) than their male partners (41.4 \u00b1 9.66 and 35.3 \u00b1 8.57, p < 0.01). Over the course of several IVF cycles, average STAI scores increased for both genders. When asked about specific stress factors on a 4-point scale from 'not at all' to 'very much so', women report as their main anxiety the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy, scoring significantly higher on questions like 'obtaining a negative pregnancy test' (3.24 \u00b1 0.82, p < 0.01) and 'disclosure of infertility' (3.02 \u00b1 1.10, p < 0.001). Their male partners are more concerned about the health risks the women have to take such as 'side effects of ovarian stimulation' (2.55 \u00b1 0.77, p = 0.002) and 'bleeding or infection after the oocyte aspiration' (2.58 \u00b1 0.84, p = 0.007). Both genders indicated to be very little worried about multiple pregnancies after IVF.",
        "Women show a higher level of anxiety during IVF treatment and hold different concerns. Neither of the sexes appears to be familiar with the risks associated with multiple pregnancies, a matter that should better be addressed."
