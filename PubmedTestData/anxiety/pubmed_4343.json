        "Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has led to the demise of millions of people worldwide; additionally, it has resulted in a significant economic and mental health burden. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various measures have been constructed to evaluate pandemic-related fear and anxiety. The COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) is a promising measure that assesses coping strategies (e.g., avoidance, checking, worrying and threat monitoring), termed 'COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome', in response to COVID-19 fear and anxiety. The measure has been broadly welcomed, leading to its use in Brazil (Portuguese), China, Greece, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran (Farsi), Italy, Saudi Arabia (Arabic), Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. To gain a better understanding of the relevance of the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the psychological correlates and psychometric properties of the C-19ASS. Through the analysis of a total of 17,789 individuals (age range 19-70; female\u2009=\u200933%-85%), the C-19ASS demonstrated a consistent factor structure, measurement invariance across gender and acceptable reliabilities. Furthermore, a significant association with COVID-19 anxiety, depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, health anxiety, psychological distress and functional impairment (work and social adjustment) during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed. When considering the Big Five personality traits, the C-19ASS and its subscales were only significantly and negatively associated with extraversion; only the total score on the measure was associated with neuroticism. The observed effect sizes ranged from very small to medium. Given that all included studies (K\u2009=\u200924) were cross-sectional, and due to the nature of the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome, which may well persist after the pandemic ends, it is recommended to continue screening society for the persistence of this syndrome."
