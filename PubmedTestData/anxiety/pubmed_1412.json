      "AbstractText": [
        "older adults living in long-term care (LTC) commonly suffer from anxiety symptoms and disorders. We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify efficacious treatments for anxiety symptoms for older adults living in LTC.",
        "we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify treatments for anxiety that have been trialled in LTC. Included studies had to be randomised trials, include residents of LTC, and measure anxiety symptoms as an outcome.",
        "the electronic search returned 6,617 articles, 519 were reviewed in full text, and 80 were included in the descriptive synthesis. Limited studies were meta-analysed (n\u2009=\u200910) due to differences in described treatment and comparator conditions. Limited clinically relevant evidence supporting the use of pharmacologic treatments for symptoms of anxiety in LTC was identified. Of the treatments trialled, music compared with usual care (standardised mean difference, SMD: -0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.31, -0.34), music compared with social interaction (SMD: -0.41; 95% CI: -0.72, -0.10) and massage compared with usual care (SMD: -4.32; 95% CI: -7.44, -1.19) were found to improve anxiety symptoms, however, significant heterogeneity was detected in two comparisons.",
        "a range of non-pharmacologic treatments that improved anxiety symptoms were identified for use in LTC. Although limited evidence exists to support the use of particular treatments, most non-pharmacologic treatments were low-risk interventions that may be readily implemented. Further research is required to assess the treatment effect on residents of LTC with anxiety disorders or clinically relevant symptoms at baseline."
