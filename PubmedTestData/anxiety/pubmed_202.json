        "The developmental period of the teenage years and young adulthood can be a challenging time for most. Experiencing a diagnosis of cancer during this time inevitably presents further challenges and concerns. Identifying such issues can help to provide better ways of understanding the patients' experience and their needs, offering nurses insight to enhance care and support for teenagers and young adults (TYAs) undergoing cancer treatments.",
        "To explore the literature regarding the psychological issues faced by TYAs during cancer treatment to inform nursing practice.",
        "A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted using predetermined search terms which yielded relevant articles. Applying an inclusion and exclusion criteria identified six articles that were deemed appropriate to explore the focus question.",
        "A thematic analysis identified three main themes and five sub-themes: anxieties about treatment, concerns regarding the impact on life (feeling restricted and different, the benefits of being sick, facing uncertainty) and coping strategies (positive thinking and problem solving, support).",
        "Teenagers and young adults face a unique set of psychological concerns and challenges during cancer treatment, resulting in the development of specific coping strategies. These strategies should be promoted by nurses, ensuring patients are supported throughout their cancer journey."
