        "Work-related stress and burnout were documented to be high among pediatric radiologists prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New challenges arose from the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially introducing new stressors and anxieties.",
        "To evaluate potential sources of stress and anxiety for pediatric radiology faculty during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "We conducted a survey of attending physician members of the Society for Pediatric Radiology in North America from April 27, 2020, to May 22, 2020. The response rate was 21% (251/1,206). Survey questions included demographic information and questions regarding working remotely, personal protective equipment, redeployment, personal wellness, wellness resources and financial concerns. A psychometrician reviewed the questions to ensure minimal risk of misinterpretation.",
        "Median age of respondents was 48\u00a0years (range 33-70\u00a0years) with median number of years in practice of 14 (range 1-45\u00a0years). Fifty-three percent of respondents were women and 46% were men. Because of an increase in remote work, 69% of respondents endorsed feeling more isolated from a lack of regular interaction with colleagues. Fifty-three percent of respondents indicated that it is challenging to work remotely while overseeing home schooling for children. In comparison to men, women reported overall higher work-related stress and anxiety (P=0.02), higher feelings of guilt from radiology staff (i.e. technologists and nurses) being more exposed to COVID-19 (P=0.02) and higher levels of stress providing for dependents (P=0.04). Most respondents thought that departmental leadership was effective and respondents were not concerned about meeting financial obligations or job loss.",
        "The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic caused additional stress and anxiety for pediatric radiology faculty and disproportionally affected women. Given the continuously evolving state of the COVID-19 pandemic, these results could aid in planning and implementation of future strategies to combat burnout in radiology. Specific attention should be directed to different stressors experienced by female versus male radiologists, especially in regard to dependent care."
