        "Using a novel pharmacological conditioning procedure, pigs were conditioned to discriminate the effects of a subconvulsant dose of the anxiogenic drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 2.8-10 mg/kg, i.v.) from saline. The operant chamber provided two levers at which pigs were trained to press at a fixed ratio of 20 presses per food reward (FR 20). The animals were conditioned to select both levers alternately following saline treatment and to select one lever only following PTZ treatment. This procedure enabled the onset and offset of the PTZ stimulus to be detected within single test sessions; infusion of PTZ to animals already selecting both levers alternately after a saline pretreatment induced a period of response exclusive to the PTZ lever followed by a return to an alternation of lever selection response. The ability of the novel procedure to detect the time course of the drug cue should improve future evaluations of the psychological states induced by centrally acting drugs. With PTZ as the training drug, the novel procedure presents a valuable means to study the neurobiology of anxiety."
