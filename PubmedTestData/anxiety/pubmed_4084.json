        "Depression, anxiety, and fear of recurrence (FOR) are prevalent among cancer survivors, and it is recommended that they have access to supportive services and resources to address psychosocial needs during follow-up care. This study examined the impact of a virtual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based telephone coaching program (BounceBack\u00ae) on depression, anxiety, and FOR.",
        "Through the After Cancer Treatment Transition (ACTT) clinic at the Women's College Hospital (Toronto, Canada), eligible participants were identified, consented, and referred to the BounceBack\u00ae program. Program participation involved completion of self-selected online workbooks and support from trained telephone coaches. Measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and FOR (fear of cancer recurrence inventory, FCRI) were collected at pre-intervention (baseline) and post-intervention (6-month and 12-month time points). For each psychosocial measure, paired t-tests compared mean scores between study time points. Participant experiences and perceptions were collected through a survey.",
        "Measures of depression and anxiety significantly improved among participants from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 decreased from moderate to mild levels. Measure of FOR also significantly improved, while FCRI sub-scale scores significantly improved for 5 of the 7 factors that characterize FOR (triggers, severity, psychological distress, functional impairment, insight). Participants rated the intervention a mean score of 7 (out of 10), indicating a moderate level of satisfaction and usefulness.",
        "This study suggested that a virtual CBT-based telephone coaching program can be an effective approach to managing depression, anxiety, and fear of recurrence in cancer survivors."
