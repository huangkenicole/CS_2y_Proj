        "This study aimed to investigate the effects ofguided imagery on state and trait anxiety and sleep quality among hemodial ysis patients.",
        "This was a randomized controlled trial. A total of seventy hemodialysis patients were assigned through block randomization to either an intervention group to receive guided imagery or a control group to receive routine care services.",
        "The study was performed in the hemodialysis unit of Akhavan teaching hospital, Kashan, Iran.",
        "In addition to routine care services, patients in the intervention group received guided imagery six times a week for four successive weeks via listening to a guided imagery instructional compact disk and following the instructions.",
        "Before and four weeks after the intervention, state and trait anxiety and sleep quality were measured via Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.",
        "The results of analysis of covariance showed that the intervention and the control groups significantly differed from each other respecting the posttest mean scores of state anxiety (adjusted mean difference: -9.11; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f-10.26 to_-7.96; P\u202f<\u202f0.001), trait anxiety (adjusted mean difference: -8.94; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f-10.31_to -7.57; P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and sleep quality (adjusted mean difference: -0.877; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f-1.51_to -0.24; P\u202f<\u202f0.007).",
        "Guided imagery can significantly alleviate anxiety and improve sleep quality among hemodialysis patients. Nurses are recommended to use guided imagery to alleviate hemodialysis patients' anxiety and improve their sleep quality."
