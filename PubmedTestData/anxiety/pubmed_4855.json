        "The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening adults for depression in settings with programs in place to ensure receipt of appropriate care. Best practices regarding how to ensure such care are unknown, particularly for pregnant and postpartum persons.",
        "To compare the effectiveness of 2 strategies for the initial management of screen-detected peripartum depressive symptoms.",
        "This randomized comparative effectiveness trial was performed from February 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020, at the prenatal clinic, postpartum unit, and pediatric clinic within an urban safety-net hospital. Participants included peripartum persons with positive depression screen results. Data were analyzed from July 6, 2020, to September 21, 2022, based on intention to treat.",
        "Engagement-focused care coordination (EFCC), which used shared decision-making and motivational techniques to refer patients to outside mental health services, and problem-solving education (PSE), a brief cognitive-behavioral program delivered at the screening site.",
        "The primary outcome consisted of severity of depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes included severity of anxiety symptoms and engagement with care, each measured bimonthly over 12 months. Rates of symptom elevations were modeled using negative binomial regression; rates of symptom trajectories were modeled using treatment \u00d7 time interactions.",
        "Among the 230 participants (mean [SD] age, 29.8 [5.8] years), 125 (54.3%) were Black and 101 (43.9%) were Hispanic or Latina. At baseline, 117 participants (50.9%) reported at least moderately severe depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score \u226511), and 56 (24.3%) reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory score \u226521). Across 6 assessment time points, the mean (SD) number of moderately severe depressive symptom episodes in EFCC was 2.2 (2.2), compared with 2.2 (2.1) in PSE, for an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77-1.17). The mean (SD) number of anxiety symptom elevations in EFCC was 1.1 (1.8), compared to 1.1 (1.6) in PSE, for an aRR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.69-1.39). There were significant treatment \u00d7 time interactions relative to mean depressive symptom scores (-0.34 [95% CI, -0.60 to -0.08]; P\u2009=\u2009.009 for interaction term), favoring EFCC. There were no differences in engagement with care.",
        "In this randomized comparative effectiveness trial, there were no differences in depressive or anxiety symptom burden across comparators; however, the evidence suggested improved depressive symptom trajectory with immediate referral. Further work is necessary to guide approaches to management following depression screening for peripartum persons.",
