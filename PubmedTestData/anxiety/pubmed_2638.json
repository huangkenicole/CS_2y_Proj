        "To measure the prevalence of anxiety and depression in intensive care patients six months after admission to an intensive care unit and to investigate which variables are associated with anxiety and depression at six months.",
        "In this cohort study, patient-reported outcome measures were collected as soon as possible upon admission and at six months. Two logistic regression models were performed to examine variables associated with reporting anxiety and depression above \u22658 at six months.",
        "Patients were recruited from six intensive care units in two Norwegian hospitals between 2018 and 2020.",
        "The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.",
        "A total of 145 patients was included in the study. The patients reported a prevalence of 18.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and 12.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a018) of anxiety and depression, respectively. Higher baseline anxiety scores were associated with both higher odds of reporting anxiety and depression above \u22658. Younger age was associated with higher odds of reporting anxiety, and being female was associated with lower odds of reporting depression.",
        "Several intensive care survivors reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression six months after admission to the intensive care unit. Younger age, and higher anxiety scores at baseline were variables associated with higher odds of reporting symptoms of either anxiety or depression, while being female was associated with a lower odds of reporting depression.",
        "Screening patients for anxiety and depression may help to identify vulnerable patients. Structured follow-ups with intensive care nurses in an outpatient setting may be useful to help patients to work through some of the experiences from the intensive care unit."
