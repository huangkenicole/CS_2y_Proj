      "AbstractText": [
        "This epidemiological study described changes in the estimated prevalence of current pharmacological and/or psychotherapy-based treatment utilization among college students with depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression & anxiety.",
        "A sample of 190,500 weighted responses was collected through the 2013-2019 Healthy Minds Study questionnaires. Annual prevalence estimates of depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression & anxiety were computed. Current use of therapy, pharmacological services, or dual treatment among students with depression and/or anxiety were examined via descriptive statistics.",
        "Estimated prevalence of college students who screened positive for depression only, anxiety only, and comorbid depression & anxiety escalated from 2013 to 2018-2019. When assessed individually, rates of currently using any psychiatric medication, participating in therapy, and engaging in concurrent medication & therapy services significantly rose among students with depression and/or anxiety. However, temporal trends in the current use of specific classes of psychiatric medications among young adults with depression only, anxiety only, or comorbid depression & anxiety differed by medication class.",
        "This study was unable to assess psychiatric prescribing practices, depression or anxiety diagnoses, and prior mental health treatment.",
        "An increasing proportion of college students are reporting depression and/or anxiety symptoms as well as pharmacological and/or psychotherapy service utilization when comparing rates from 2013 to 2018-19. Although this may indicate increasing acceptability to disclose and seek treatment for problematic symptomology, continued surveillance of college populations is needed to identify students at risk for adverse psychiatric health outcomes, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic."
