        "Construct validity is the hallmark of Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (1970), which has generated a healthy stream of research of paramount importance in the USA and all over the world. This paper contends that scores on this scale provide valuable scientific knowledge on group norms. To expand the concept of death anxiety it is necessary to supplement empirical with qualitative research. Persons with the same scores may show qualitatively different fears of death, and vice versa. Total reliance on empirical scales may not disclose the depth of bipolar meaning in a \"life-death anxiety.\" Templer's scale is a mixture of fears, phobias, and obsessions with thoughts of illness, cancer, heart disease, and wars. A bipolar \"life-death anxiety\" continuum requires phenomenology to reach beyond the 15 items to the process of \"experiencing.\" The scale addresses \"thoughts\" about the death of others even though its items are cast in the first person singular. This provides group norms of a \"cognitive-affective\" construct, with limited generality cross-culturally. Means do not disclose fully meaningful comparisons between persons or cultures. Death Anxiety as an existential anticipatory mode of \"being-in-the-world\" is embedded in a personal/genetic/cultural matrix that may vary individually and culturally."
