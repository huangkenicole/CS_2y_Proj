        "Despite some evidence that anxiety may affect length of stay (LOS), relatively little inquiry exists regarding this in neurosurgical literature.",
        "To determine the influence of anxiety on LOS after elective lumbar decompression and fusion (LDF) surgery.",
        "The medical records of 307 patients who consecutively underwent elective LDF surgery from October 1, 2010, through September 30, 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. Each patient's medications and comorbidities were determined using the medical history. The impact of their medications on LOS was studied using multivariate analysis. Linear regression was also used to assess the relationship between anxiolytic use and LOS. An independent sample t test was used to compare the mean LOS of the group of patients receiving muscle relaxants with that of the group who were not.",
        "Those with a diagnosis of anxiety who were taking anxiolytics (n = 32) stayed 1.8 days longer than those with no diagnosis of anxiety and who were not taking anxiolytics (n = 224) after LDF surgery (p = 0.003). Those with a diagnosis of anxiety who were taking anxiolytics (n = 32) stayed 1.9 days longer than those with no diagnosis of anxiety and who were taking anxiolytics (n = 24) after LDF surgery (p = 0.003).",
        "Our study suggests that those with a diagnosis of anxiety who take medications for that condition have a longer LOS than those with no diagnosis of anxiety and who are not medicated for the condition. This could be because these patients are more vulnerable to states of anxiety when required to be nil per os for 12 hours before surgery."
