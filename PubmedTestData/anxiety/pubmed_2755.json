        "This study assessed the impact of bedside communication with fathers (N = 100) on their anxiety about sick neonates admitted in SCNU. The control group consisted of fathers of 100 sick babies communicated outside the unit. Anxiety was measured in both the groups on day 1 (at admission) and day 7, by using 5 point Likert Scale. At the time of admission there was no difference in the level of anxiety between the study group and controls (p >0.05; Mann Whitney test). There was a statistically significant difference (p <0.01; Mann Whitney test) in the level of anxiety between the study and control group at 7 days. When compared within the group, the anxiety in the fathers of study group was significantly less (p <0.01) at 7 days than at admission. In the control group there was no such significant difference. To conclude, bed side communication with fathers of admitted neonates reduces their anxiety significantly."
