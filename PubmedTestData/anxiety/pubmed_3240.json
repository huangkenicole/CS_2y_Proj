        "In this study, Problem Management Plus (PM+) was used for patients with multiple myeloma (MM), to develop a care model of psychology and quality of life.",
        "Forty cases received psychological management (PM+ group), and 40 cases underwent investigation without management (non-PM+ group). Patients were assessed using PSYCHLOPS, WHO DAS 2.0, and HADS (see Supplementary File\u00a01).",
        "The results showed that the PM+ group showed reductions in Psychological Outcome Profile scores (6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9) following program completion (preprogram scores: 16.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9, P\u00a0<\u2009.05). The non-PM+ group showed differences between preprogram (16.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8) and postprogram scores (14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6, P\u00a0<\u2009.05). The effect size of the PM+ group exceeded that of the non-PM+ group (5.1 to 1.0). In the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the PM+ group showed reductions in anxiety (6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u20091.8) and depression (5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u20090.7) (preprogram scores: 14.7\u00a0\u00b1\u20094.3, P\u00a0<\u2009.05 and 10.9\u00a0\u00b1\u20092.6, P\u00a0<\u2009.05, respectively). In the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, scores for mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation decreased in the PM+ group following program completion (all P's\u2009<\u2009.05) but did not decrease in the non-PM+ group (all P\u00a0>\u2009.05).",
        "The PM+ strategy could help patients to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression and strengthen social support, to aid in the management of problems and improve mental disorders.",
        "MM patients often experienced mental disorders and wished to participate in psychosocial interventions; the PM+ strategies should be as a wide to help patients manage their problems and alleviate the symptoms of anxiety and depression."
