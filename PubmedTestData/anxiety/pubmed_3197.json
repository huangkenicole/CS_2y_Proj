        "In order to investigate the relationship between dental anxiety and some personality traits, a group of 103 patients suffering extreme dental anxiety and therefore enrolled in a special treatment program were compared with controls sampled at random. The mean scores of the controls on dental anxiety measurements and on questionnaires dealing with personality traits were transformed into 50 with standard deviation equal to 10 to make them mutually comparable, and these subsequently were used as reference points, from which the likewise transformed mean scores of the anxiety group have to differ substantially if both groups stem from different populations. The mean scores were tested for difference with ANOVA. It appears that the anxious patients are more neurotic, i.e. more unstable, than the controls. Moreover, the patients feel themselves more uncertain with regard to having control, are less decisive, have a lower self-esteem, are less inclined to act and are, in general, anxious persons. These findings may have implications for selecting the most appropriate approach for amelioration of their anxiety or support of their coping capacity."
