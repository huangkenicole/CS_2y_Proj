        "Childhood nightmares are till today a very common phenomenon. The highest prevalence seems to be at about age six, decreasing strongly with age and no gender-specific differences in prevalence rates can be pinpointed for sure. The most frequently occurring nightmare themes are \"Being chased\", followed by dreams of \"Falling\" and those concerning, \"Loss of close persons\". As reasons for such dreams such factors as genetic influence, trait anxiety, traumatic experiences have been assumed, whereas a more comprehensive explanation model-which would take developmental issues into consideration-unfortunately does not yet exist. Numerous case studies have confirmed that childhood nightmares are easily treatable, especially where such children are encouraged to confront and cope with their anxiety. Further research such as longitudinal studies that would examine dream contents and children's waking-life experiences would be useful for a better overall understanding of the nightmare phenomenon and the causes behind their occurrence. In addition, it seems to be useful to inform parents, child caretakers, teachers and children about the simple methods in dealing with nightmares."
