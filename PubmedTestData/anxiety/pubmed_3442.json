        "The present study focused on a newly developed questionnaire to assess dental anxiety. The short version of the Dental Anxiety Inventory (S-DAI) contains nine items of the Dental Anxiety Inventory (DAI), which was designed to take into account three situations that may evoke dental anxiety, four time elements in which dental anxiety may be provoked, and three reactions. The aim was to assess the validity and reliability of the S-DAI in a sample of highly anxious dental patients applying for treatment at a dental fear clinic in the Netherlands. Three hundred and twenty-one patients filled out several questionnaires assessing dental anxiety (S-DAI, DAS, and a 10-point Likert-scale) and psychological complaints. Total mean score on the S-DAI for women (mean=40.5, s=5.7) was somewhat higher than for men (mean=38.8, s=6.9) (t(306)=2.35; P=0.019). Cronbach's alpha for the present sample was 0.88. Correlations with other measures of dental anxiety were 0.73 with the DAS (P<0.001) and 0.69 (P<0.001) with the 10-point scale. The results indicated that the S-DAI has good reliability and construct validity. It was concluded that the S-DAI is easy to administer in general dental practices and dental fear clinics and has satisfactory psychometric qualities."
