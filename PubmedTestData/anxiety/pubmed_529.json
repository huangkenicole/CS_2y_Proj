        "To describe important aspects of the recognition and management of anxiety and depression in elderly patients.",
        "We reviewed pertinent recent articles in the medical literature and compiled guidelines for diagnosing and treating anxiety and depression in the geriatric population.",
        "Depression and anxiety are common in the elderly population. The development of depression in elderly subjects is associated with a higher risk of death from suicide than for any other age-group. Recognition of depression in elderly patients is often hampered by an inability or reluctance on the part of these patients to report depressive symptoms. In addition, anxiety and depression are often attributed to organic illness in this age-group. Pharmacotherapy is effective; however, older patients are probably more likely than young patients to experience adverse effects. Using medications at lower doses, choosing drugs with shorter half-lives, and avoiding drugs with potent anticholinergic side effects are often advisable.",
        "Anxiety and depression are common conditions among the elderly population. Correct recognition, attention to underlying precipitating factors, and compassionate, supportive care can vastly improve the quality of the lives of these patients."
