        "Social support is a widely studied construct due to its associations with physical and emotional well-being outcomes (Uchino, 2006). However, little research examines the context within which receiving support may be helpful (Picard, Lee, & Hunsley, 1997). Whereas examinations of support adequacy are present in the literature (e.g., Song et al., 2012), limited research considers the difference between support needs and support received when the 2 are separated as distinct constructs. The current study consisted of 428 undergraduate college students and examined how the relation between social support needs and received social support relates to depressive and anxiety symptoms via a statistical approach suggested for need-actual discrepancy analysis (polynomial multiple regression, PMR, with response surface analysis; Edwards, 1994; Shanock, Baran, Gentry, Pattison, & Heggestad, 2010). Results indicated that greater discrepancy between needed support and received support was related to greater depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms. Specifically, when emotional support needs exceeded emotional support received, depressive symptoms tended to be highest. Moreover, perceptions of needed support were significantly greater than perceptions of received support, suggesting that college students in general perceive receiving less support than they need, and this discrepancy is related to greater depressive symptoms.
