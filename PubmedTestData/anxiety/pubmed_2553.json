        "Symptom endorsements and item response patterns on the anxiety-present and anxiety-absent items of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (Spielberger, 1983) for 149 Japanese (99 living in Japan and 50 studying in the United States) and 76 American university students were compared. Although mean scores for the state and trait anxiety-absent items were comparable for Japanese students living in Japan and Japanese international students studying in the United States, the scores of both Japanese groups were significantly higher than those of American students. These differences were attributable to much higher scores of Japanese students on anxiety-absent items that corresponded to a lack of positive feelings. Japanese students had a tendency to inhibit positive (anxiety-absent) feelings, resulting in higher anxiety scores. Responses to anxiety-present and anxiety-absent items should be considered independently in scoring anxiety scales."
