        "Due to the increasing debate of limiting costs in the public health system, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been under discussion for several times. Diagnostic imaging by means of MRI is an expensive but informative and safe method. Instead of looking on cost-benefit analysis, it is shown how the efficiency of MRI can be increased by improving patient information about this imaging method. Because of the technical conditions, up to 40% of the patients show anxiety-related-reactions. These reactions include slight discomfort up to claustrophobic reactions and panic attacks. Therefore, correct and complete informing of patients prior to MRI examinations by the physicians is very important. The given information should include technical aspects about MRI and in addition, the physician has a chance to evaluate the patients' disposition to anxiety-related-reactions. To prepare risk patients for successful MRI technics like music, prone positioning, sedatives and relaxation exercises are available. By taking patients' anxiety into consideration and using the techniques mentioned above, unnecessary costs for unsuccessful or repeated MRI examinations can be avoided and the overall costs for clinical diagnostics will be reduced."
