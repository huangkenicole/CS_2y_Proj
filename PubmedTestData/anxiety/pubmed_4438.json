        "Difficulties in interpersonal relationships are common complaints of psychiatric patients, and some investigators have contended that a lack of social skills, excessive social anxiety, and interpersonal problems are important causes of psychiatric disorders. To investigate further the relationship between social anxiety and psychiatric disorders, a survey of outpatients (N = 303) and untreated controls (N = 216) was conducted using measures of social anxiety, self-consciousness, general anxiety, and depression. Schizophrenics, secondary depressives, and nonpsychotic patients in individual and group psychotherapy characterized themselves as most shy in the diagnostically mixed patient group. Patients with primary effective disorders and family therapy patients were less socially anxious and resembled the control group in this respect. The single best predictor of status as a patient vs. status as a control was level of depression as determined by a stepwise discriminant function analysis. The relationship between social anxiety and secondary depression deserves additional attention in order to assess the possible causal links between this variables."
