        "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant treatment for depression. Many patients with depression have comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, previous rTMS studies have focused on patients with depression, and often excluded comorbid anxiety. This real-world study aimed to investigate the comparative efficacy of add-on rTMS in treating the somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms of depression comorbid with anxiety in adolescents, adults and elderly patients.",
        "This study included 147 depression patients with anxiety symptoms who were treated with at least 10 sessions of rTMS. The symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. This was done to compare the improvement degree of add-on rTMS on somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms in adolescents, adults and elderly patients respectively.",
        "Both somatic and psychic anxiety symptoms were significantly improved after the add-on rTMS in adolescents, adults and elderly patients. The improvement of somatic anxiety was better than that of psychic anxiety after rTMS treatment in elderly patients (t<sub>2w</sub>=3.895, P<0.001; t<sub>4w</sub>=2.823, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008).",
        "The overall sample was mostly composed of elderly patients, while adolescents and adult patients were fewer.",
        "The add-on rTMS treatment can improve somatic anxiety better than psychic anxiety in depression with anxiety symptoms, especially in elderly patients."
