        "This study was done to verify a prediction in achievement goal-orientation theory in a Korean physical education setting. It was hypothesized that the interactions of situationally induced motivational climates (Task and Ego) and perceived competence would differentially influence anxiety and performance in tennis classes. 60 undergraduate men were assigned to a Task-involving and an Ego-involving program in tennis classes for 6 wk. Their perceptions of motivation climates and tennis competence were measured after the first 3 wk., and anxiety responses (cognitive and somatic) and tennis skill performance were evaluated every week over the second 3 wk. of the class. Analysis showed in Task-involving condition students decreased anxiety responses and increased tennis performance, whereas Ego-involving students who had low perception of their tennis competence maintained their anxiety responses and decreased their tennis performance. These results support the hypotheses and the predictions of goal-orientation theory and suggested practical application of the goal-orientation theory in Korea could be explored."
