        "Although results regarding objective social skills deficits in adults are inconsistent, research with youth have consistently demonstrated such deficits. Furthermore, research has consistently demonstrated subjective appraisal of social skill deficit in both youth and adults with social phobia or social anxiety. As a result, research has begun to examine the presence of a negative perceptual bias in individuals with social phobia and social anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to extend the findings of social skill deficits to an adolescent sample by investigating differences between adolescents with social phobia and non-anxious peers with regard to objective and subjective behavioral ratings. In addition, the presence of a negative perceptual bias was investigated by examining discrepancy scores between these ratings. The results of the current study provide support for the presence of social skill deficits in a socially phobic adolescent population and are the first to suggest that a limited negative bias exists in this population."
