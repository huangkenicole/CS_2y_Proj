        "Individuals who believe that experiencing positive emotions such as happiness could lead to negative results can suppress their authentic positive feelings to prevent undesired consequences. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of fear of happiness as a cultural phenomenon among puerperal women and the effects of fear of happiness on anxiety and self-efficacy in these women.",
        "This cross-sectional study was conducted in the puerperal service of a hospital in Turkey between September 2021 and June 2022 (<i>n</i> = 287). The study data were collected through State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI-I and STAI-II), General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, and Fear of Happiness Scale (FHS).",
        "There was a significant relationship between STAI-II and GSE and FHS scores, which explained 43.4% (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .434) of the variance (<i>p</i> < .001). Also, a significant relationship of GSE with working at an income-generating job, STAI-I, and STAI-II was found (<i>p</i> = .008, <i>p</i> = .040, <i>p</i> < .001, respectively). It was found that the puerperae who stated that they needed training on the postpartum process and baby care had high levels of fear of happiness (<i>p</i> = .007).",
        "Screening puerperae in terms of fear of happiness is important for determining their psychological well-being. Health care professionals should be aware that fear of happiness as a cultural approach negatively affects anxiety and therefore self-efficacy levels of puerperae. Providing a comprehensive training to the puerperae on parenthood and self-efficacy as well as mental health support is important for them to cope with fear of happiness."
