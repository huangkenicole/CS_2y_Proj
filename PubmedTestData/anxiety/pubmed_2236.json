        "To evaluate how gelotophobia correlates with trait anxiety in a sample of Brazilian college students.",
        "We evaluated the association of GELOPH &lt; 15 &gt; scores with both self-reported experiences of bullying victimization and trait anxiety measures assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The study consisted of a sample of 65 adult volunteers (M = 21.48, SD = 2.54 years, 38 females), recruited through social media or flyer distribution, and submitted to online versions of the gelotophobia assessment instrument (GELOPH &lt; 15 &gt;) and the STAI.",
        "Most participants (N = 56, 86.15%) had an STAI-T score indicative of high trait anxiety. The average GELOPH &lt; 15 &gt; score of the sample was 2.69 (0.65) and 39 of the subjects (60%) were considered gelotophobes. There was a strong positive correlation between the GELOPH &lt; 15 &gt; and STAI-T scores but no correlation between bullying and either the STAI-T and GELOPH &lt; 15 &gt; scores. However, the great majority of subjects with gelotophobia reported been previously bullied.",
        "In our sample, all gelotophobes had trait anxiety, but only a fraction of anxious subjects had gelotophobia. These preliminary findings expand on previous reports underscoring the high prevalence of mental health problems afflicting higher education students in Brazil."
