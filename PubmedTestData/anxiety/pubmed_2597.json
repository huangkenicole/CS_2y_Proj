        "Anatomical dissection on cadavers can be a source of anxiety for medical students. Studies in other stressful settings have shown a reduction in anxiety when there is background music. The objective of this study was to determine if music can have an impact on student anxiety, student satisfaction, and student performance in dissection room. This cluster randomized interventional trial included 187\u00a0second-year medical students. The intervention was standardized background music, selected based on the literature, with a tempo of between 60 and 80\u00a0bpm. Six balanced clusters were randomized (1:1) to music or no music during dissection sessions. The main assessment criterion was a validated self-evaluation scale score for anxiety, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Student satisfaction was measured using a visual analog scale and dissection performance was evaluated by an examination. The outcomes were analyzed with mixed models adjusted on group effect, chronic anxiety, and confounding factors. A significant (58%) relative decrease in acute anxiety, odds ratio 0.423 [0.160; 0.710] was found for the music intervention group. Music also had a positive impact on performance with students in the intervention group attaining higher grades than those in the control group (0.42/10 higher, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0016). The study also showed a nonsignificant increase in satisfaction with 0.37 extra points (P\u00a0=\u00a00.137) in the intervention group. Background music had a significant impact on anxiety in the dissection room and on technical and theoretical performance in the subsequent anatomy examination. This music intervention could be extended to other stressful work environments."
