        "A new subtype of depression is proposed, named: anxiety/aggression-driven depression. The psychopathological, psychopharmacological and biochemical evidence on which this construct is based, is being discussed. Selective postsynaptic 5-HT1A agonists together with CRH and/or cortisol antagonists are hypothesized to be a specific biological treatment for this depression type, in conjunction with psychological interventions to raise the stressor-threshold and to increase coping skills. The development of this depression construct has been contingent on the introduction of two new diagnostic procedures, called functionalization and verticalization of psychiatric diagnosis. These procedures are explained and it is stressed that they are essential to psychiatric diagnosing, in order to put this process on a scientific footing."
