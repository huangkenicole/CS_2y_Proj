        "There is a worldwide trend towards involving patients in health care, but little is known about children's expectations of routine radiological procedures.",
        "To determine children's perceptions of X-ray examinations.",
        "A convenience sample was selected from consecutive patients referred to a children's hospital in Scotland. Children were allocated either to a drawing study ( n=20) or a two-stage interview ( n=25). The investigation was restricted to first-time users of the radiological service aged 7-14 years if accompanied by a parent and consent having been obtained. Children were excluded if pain control was administered in the Accident and Emergency Department. Children's drawings were reported on by an art therapist and a child psychiatrist.",
        "All children approached agreed to participate. Seventeen children provided accurate pictures of the X-ray examination room. Concordance existed between the psychiatrist's and art therapist's reports. Children at interview had at least a minimal level of knowledge of X-rays and this was from (1) family, friends and neighbours, (2) the school classroom, and (3) television programmes.",
        "Children had anxieties revealed through drawings and interviews. We recommend drawings for establishing children's views of radiology."
