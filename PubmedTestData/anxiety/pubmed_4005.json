        "The purposes of this repeated measures study were to examine the feasibility of using music as an intervention for dyspnea and anxiety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who live in their homes and to examine the effect of music on anxiety and dyspnea. Twenty-four participants who experienced dyspnea at least once a week were studied over a 5-week period. Baseline data were collected on Week 1. Measures of anxiety and dyspnea were taken on Week 2, prior to and immediately following the use of music. These measures were repeated on Week 5. There was a significant decrease in dyspnea following the use of music as reported in the music diary (p < .001). There was a significant decline in anxiety (p < .05) and dyspnea (p < .01) following the use of music on Week 2. There was no significant change in anxiety or dyspnea over the 5-week period."
