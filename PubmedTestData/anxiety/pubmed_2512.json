        "Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) is a psychotherapy helping individuals develop adaptive behaviors, whose application in colorectal cancer (CRC) is rare. This randomized, controlled study intended to explore the effect of CBSM on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in CRC patients post tumor resection.",
        "One hundred and sixty CRC patients who received tumor resection were randomized (1:1) to receive weekly CBSM or usual care (UC) for 10\u00a0weeks after discharge (120\u00a0min for each session). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) of each patient were assessed after randomization (M0), one month (M1), three months (M3), and six months (M6).",
        "CBSM realized decreased HADS-anxiety scores at M1 (P\u2009=\u20090.044), M3 (P\u2009=\u20090.020), M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.003) compared to UC, so did anxiety rates at M3 (28.0% vs. 43.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.045), M6 (25.7% vs. 42.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.035), HADS-depression scores at M3 (P\u2009=\u20090.017), M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.005), and depression rates at M3 (25.3% vs. 41.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.040), M6 (22.9% vs. 41.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.020). Concerning the quality of life, CBSM achieved elevated QLQ-C30 global health status scores at M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.008), QLQ-C30 functions scores at M3 (P\u2009=\u20090.047), M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.031), and decreased QLQ-C30 symptoms scores at M3 (P\u2009=\u20090.048) and M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.039) compared with UC. By subgroup analyses, CBSM had a better utility on relieving anxiety, depression and improving quality of life in patients with higher education level and patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.",
