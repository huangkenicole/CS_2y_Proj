        "Critical first steps in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) include re-nutrition and weight restoration, both highly anxiety provoking for patients. We explored the impact of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), guided imagery (GI), self-directed relaxation (SR), and control (C) on reducing postprandial anxiety in 64 females with AN.",
        "Participants began the study upon hospital admission. They received relaxation training after lunch for 15 days. Pre- and post-session anxiety and treatment acceptability ratings were made daily.",
        "Although all conditions improved relaxation and decreased anxiety, feelings of fullness, and thoughts about weight, the three active conditions significantly reduced anxiety and increased relaxation more than C (p < .0001). Participants significantly enjoyed the three active treatments, were more likely to recommend them to a friend, and were more likely to use either PMR or GI again versus C (p < .0001).",
        "Relaxation may be a valuable component for reducing postprandial anxiety in AN."
