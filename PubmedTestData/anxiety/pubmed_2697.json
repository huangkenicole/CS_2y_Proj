        "Cancer causes significant impacts on patients and their caregivers. Cancer is also associated with multiple physical and emotional challenges for the patient-caregiver dyad. This patient-caregiver dyad should be considered as a unit of care by healthcare providers and supported through dedicated psychological interventions.",
        "Twelve studies that tested dyadic interventions aiming to support patient-caregiver dyads were identified from the period April 2020 to December 2021. Studies were predominantly randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm pilot studies. Half of the interventions were online. Interventions were mostly focused on dyadic adjustment and appeared to be acceptable, feasible and globally effective. However, effects were evident predominantly on individual rather than dyadic outcomes. The interventions targeted either individual psychological outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, and are reported to be effective or various individual outcomes and also appeared to be effective. However, there was a large heterogeneity in quality and sample sizes across all intervention types.",
        "Dyadic psychological interventions may be an effective support for patient-caregiver dyads dealing with multiple physical and emotional challenges. Online interventions and the variability of intervention types may respond to dyads specific needs, but though need to be rigorously evaluated through powered RCTs."
