        "Since as many as 20% of all college women report symptoms of eating disorders, the present study examined the relationship between self-reported eating disorder symptoms. anxiety, drinking, and retrospective reports of inconsistent parenting during childhood. 101 college women, 85% Euro-Americans of mean age 19 yr., completed an anonymous survey including questions from the Eating Disorder Index-1, the Retrospective Family Unpredictability Scale, the Trait Anxiety Scale, and measures of drinking in the previous month. Eating disorder symptoms correlated with self-reported drinking quantity, anxiety, and retrospective ratings of inconsistent discipline. This appears to be the first time eating disorder symptoms have been associated with inconsistent discipline. Implications for etiology and treatment of eating disorders are discussed."
