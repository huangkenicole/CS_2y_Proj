        "Driving aggression and anxiety are significant contributors to risky driving and motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), which are leading causes of U.S. morbidity and mortality. Even though aggression and anxiety can be conceptualized as related features of the fight-or-flight response, literature on these topics has not been integrated. Driving aggression and anxiety are also transdiagnostic constructs that span multiple psychiatric disorders. Assessment and treatment of these complex problems must be understood to reduce the public health burden of MVCs.",
        "A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PsycInfo and Google Scholar.",
        "Definitions and prevalence of constructs including driving anger, aggressive driving, posttraumatic stress disorder, driving phobia, and transdiagnostic factors are delineated. Psychosocial correlates and assessment instruments are reviewed. Theoretical models that explicate personological, affective, cognitive, and behavioral components are explored. Differential and shared processes underlying driving aggression and anxiety are examined. Interventions are described, with a focus on promising cognitive-behavioral methods.",
        "Driving aggression and anxiety likely share affective and cognitive characteristics such as emotional reactivity and distorted threat appraisals. Further research is needed to support theoretical models linking driving aggression and anxiety, and to validate assessment instruments that capture both constructs. Epidemiologic studies are needed to determine norms, prevalence, and clinical cutpoints. Integration of interventions for these interrelated problems could ultimately reduce risky driving and MVCs."
