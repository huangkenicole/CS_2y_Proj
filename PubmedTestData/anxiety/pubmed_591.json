      "AbstractText": [
        "Preoperative distress is commonly experienced by surgical patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes. Research suggests preoperative distress may be elevated among cancer surgery patients relative to other surgical groups and there appears to be greater recognition of the adverse impacts of distress for these patients. This study examined associations between preoperative distress and postoperative healthcare-related correlates (e.g., length of stay, re-hospitalization) among a large, mixed surgical sample, and separately among cancer surgery patients with active cancer.",
        "We analyzed secondary data from the Vascular Events In Non-cardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) study - Mental Health Supplement (N\u00a0=\u00a0997; n\u00a0=\u00a0370 active cancer/cancer surgery). The Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale assessed preoperative distress on the day of surgery. Multivariable regressions examined associations between distress and healthcare-related correlates. For significant relationships, we examined associations between anxiety and depressive subscales of distress with the correlates of interest.",
        "Among the full surgical sample, after adjustment, preoperative distress was associated with a greater length of stay (b\u00a0=\u00a00.01, 95% CI [0.00-0.02], R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.15, f<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.18) and increased odds of re-hospitalization (AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.07, 95%CI [1.01-1.13]). Results were comparable among cancer surgery patients (length of stay: b\u00a0=\u00a00.02, re-hospitalization: AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.11). Post-hoc analyses revealed associations between anxiety symptoms and re-hospitalization (AOR range: 1.13-1.26) and between depressive symptoms and length of hospital stay (b range: 0.02-0.04, R<sup>2</sup> range: 0.07-0.15, f<sup>2</sup> range: 0.07-0.18).",
        "Findings suggest preoperative distress may be associated with greater postoperative healthcare needs. Results support the importance of screening for distress in the perioperative period."
