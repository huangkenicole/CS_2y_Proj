        "The non-Hispanic Black population experiences trauma-related disparities. One potentially important individual difference construct for posttraumatic stress is anxiety sensitivity. There is limited work on anxiety sensitivity among non-Hispanic Black persons, and no research has focused on this construct in terms of posttraumatic stress among this population. This study sought to build on this limited knowledge by exploring whether this construct was uniquely associated with more severe posttraumatic stress among this population. Participants included non-Hispanic Black trauma-exposed adults ( N = 121; Mage = 21.79 years). Results indicated that anxiety sensitivity was related to more severe overall posttraumatic stress and greater severity of each posttraumatic stress symptom cluster; all effects were evident after adjusting for the variance accounted for by age, sex, education, subjective social status, neuroticism, and number of traumatic event types experienced (lifetime). The study provides the first empirical evidence that, among a trauma-exposed non-Hispanic Black sample of adults, anxiety sensitivity is related to more severe posttraumatic stress symptoms. This intraindividual difference factor could be a focus of intervention programming for this trauma disparity population."
