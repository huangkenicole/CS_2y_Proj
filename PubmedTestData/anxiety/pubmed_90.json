        "There are uncertainties about prostate cancer-related anxiety's (PCRA) associations with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and major depression, and these could affect the quality of mental healthcare provided to prostate cancer patients. Addressing these uncertainties will provide more insight into PCRA and inform further research on the value of PCRA prevention. The goals of this study were to measure associations between PCRA and HRQOL at domain and subdomain levels, and to evaluate the association between PCRA and probable (ie, predicted major) depression.",
        "We analyzed secondary cross-sectional data from the North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effectiveness & Survivorship Study (NC ProCESS-a population-based cohort of prostate cancer patients enrolled shortly after diagnosis [between January 2011 and June 2013] and followed prospectively). Patient-reported measures of PCRA and HRQOL from 1,016 enrollees who participated in NC ProCESS's 1-year follow-up survey were assessed. Outcomes of interests were a) linear correlations between contemporaneous memorial anxiety scale for prostate cancer (MAX-PC) and Short Form 12 (SF-12) scores, and b) measures of association between indicators of clinically significant PCRA (ie, MAX-PC\u00a0>\u00a027) and probable depression during survey contact (ie, SF-12 mental component score\u00a0\u226443).",
        "PCRA measures had notable associations with SF-12's mental health subscale (assesses low mood/nervousness [rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.42]) and emotional role functioning subscale (assesses subjective productivity loss [rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.46]). Additionally, the risk of probable depression was significantly higher in participants with clinically significant PCRA compared with those without it (weighed risk ratio\u00a0=\u00a05.3, 95% confidence interval 3.6-7.8; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).",
        "Prostate cancer patients with clinically significant PCRA should be assessed for major depression and productivity loss."
