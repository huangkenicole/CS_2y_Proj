        "Virtual reality therapy has been shown to be effective in coping with psychological disorders accompanied by cardiovascular disease. Age appears to be a factor that can affect the effectiveness of psychological therapy in a virtual environment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether there are age-related differences in the effectiveness of reducing levels of depression and anxiety during a virtual reality psychological intervention implemented for rehabilitation. The study included 25 younger (<\u200965 years) and 25 older (65\u2009+) patients with cardiovascular disease who participated in virtual reality therapy to cope with anxiety and depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depressive disorders before and after intervention. Significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after intervention were observed in both age-matched groups, and no significant differences were found between the younger and older participants. Further evaluation of patient age as a predictor of the effectiveness of psychological intervention in virtual reality did not show a significant effect of age on effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depressive disorders. The results obtained suggest that older patients benefit similarly to younger patients from psychological intervention in a virtual environment. Furthermore, age does not appear to be considered a predictor of effectiveness in reducing the level of anxiety and depression in patients with cardiovascular disease using virtual reality therapy."
