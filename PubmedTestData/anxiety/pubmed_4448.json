        "Many patients experience some degree of anxiety and/or discomfort during dermatologic procedures. For most patients this anxiety or discomfort is tolerable, but a few find it intolerable to the point of interference with the accomplishment of the procedure. A case is presented in which a 51 -year-old female experienced so much anxiety that it jeopardized the continuation of a necessary procedure. When (with her consent) a trance state was induced through hypnosis, she relaxed and remained in a pleasant mental condition for the remainder of the procedure. This case illustrates the usefulness of hypnosis in selected situations where it can alleviate anxiety and discomfort associated with dermatologic procedures. Suggested trance induction, maintenance, and termination scripts are included to assist those with adequate training and experience in providing this comfort to selected patients through hypnosis."
