        "Managing psychological distress is an objective of palliative care. No meta-analysis has evaluated whether palliative care reduces psychological distress.",
        "Examine the effects of palliative care on depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress for adults with life-limiting illnesses and their caregivers.",
        "We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and CINAHL for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of palliative care interventions. RCTs were included if they enrolled adults with life-limiting illnesses or their caregivers, reported data on psychological distress at 3 months after study intake, and if authors had described the intervention as \"palliative care.\"",
        "We identified 38 RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria. Many (14/38) included studies excluded participants with common mental health conditions. There were no statistically significant improvements in patient or caregiver anxiety (patient SMD: -0.008, P\u00a0=\u00a00.96; caregiver SMD: -0.21, P\u00a0=\u00a00.79), depression (patient SMD: -0.13, P\u00a0=\u00a00.25; caregiver SMD -0.27, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08), or psychological distress (patient SMD: 0.26, P\u00a0=\u00a00.59; caregiver SMD: 0.04, P\u00a0=\u00a00.78).",
        "Psychological distress is not likely to be reduced in the context of a typical palliative care intervention. The systemic exclusion of patients with common mental health conditions in more than 1/3 of the studies raises ethical questions about the goals of palliative care RCTS and could perpetuate inequalities."
