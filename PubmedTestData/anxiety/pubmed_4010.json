        "This paper describes a randomized controlled single blind study testing the effects of a patient education intervention combined with positive therapeutic suggestions on anxiety for cataract surgery patients.",
        "84 patients participated in the study. Physiological and behavioral indicators of anxiety were compared between a regularly treated control and an intervention group receiving an audio CD containing information, relaxation, and positive imagery.",
        "We found that the intervention group was calmer throughout the four measurement points of the study (p=.004; d=0.71) and they were more cooperative (p=.01; d=0.60) during the operation. The groups did not differ in sleep quality before the day of the operation, heart rate during the procedure, and subjective Well-being.",
        "Findings indicate that preoperative information combined with positive suggestions and anxiety management techniques might reduce patient anxiety in the perioperative period of cataract surgery, but further research is needed to investigate the benefits of such interventions and to uncover the underlying mechanisms.",
        "Patient education interventions providing additional anxiety management techniques are recommended for use prior to cataract surgery."
