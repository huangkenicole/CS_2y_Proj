        "This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Thai version of the Experiences of Close Relationships-Revised (Thai ECR-R) questionnaire.",
        "400 students from a university in northern Thailand were randomly selected to complete the Thai ECR-R, the extraversion scale for 16 personality factors, the self-esteem scale and the trait anxiety scale. A retest of the Thai ECR-R was conducted at four-week intervals. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to test the validity of the construct.",
        "The Thai ECR-R showed good internal consistency and satisfactory test-retest reliability. The avoidance and anxiety subscales demonstrated a convergent validity with the extraversion, self-esteem and trait anxiety scales. An exploratory analysis yielded a two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis also provided general support for the hypothesised two-factor model, although there was a slight lack-of-fit.",
        "The overall psychometric properties of the Thai ECR-R were acceptable. In order to render it more congruent with Thai culture, a revision of some items was considered. Further research on other age groups should be conducted in future."
