        "To critically evaluate the effects of different nursing measures based on the concept of fast-track surgery (FTS) on the negative emotions of patients with breast cancer.",
        "A systematic search of 8 databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Psycho info, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang, China science and technology journal database, and China biomedical literature database, was performed to find randomized controlled trials from inception to April 2023. Two reviewers critically and independently assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane Collaboration criteria and extracted correlated data using the designed form. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3.",
        "Ten studies were included in the systematic review, with a total of 830 patients (FTS group: 415; control group: 415). The results showed that different nursing measures based on the concept of FTS could significantly reduce anxiety (MD = -1.74, 95% confidence intervals [-2.41, -1.08], P < .00001) and depression (MD = -1.98, 95% confidence intervals [-2.44, -1.51], P < .00001) in patients after modified breast cancer surgery compared with the control group.",
        "Based on the concept of FTS, the nursing measures such as reducing preoperative fasting time, posture management, preventive analgesia, and early functional exercise can effectively reduce the anxiety and depression of patients during the perioperative period."
