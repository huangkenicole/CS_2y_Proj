        "Dysphagia was evaluated using the Eating Assessment Tool. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-8, respectively. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were performed.",
        "70% (n = 159) of survivors reported problems with swallowing safely and efficiently. Twenty-seven survivors reported symptoms of major depression, 34 reported mild symptoms of anxiety, and 19 reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. After controlling for treatment modality, age, and stage, dysphagia was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression.",
