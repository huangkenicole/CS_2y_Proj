        "Implant removal (IR) surgery is one of the most frequent procedures in orthopedic practice. Many of the IR surgeries result from patient request rather than a medical necessity. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between the level of anxiety, type of temperament and psychopathological status, and the willingness to receive IR surgery in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. We also aimed to compare pre- and postoperative pain scores and document the complication rates after IR surgery.",
        "The patients who received tibia intramedullary nailing after tibia diaphyseal fracture with a minimum of 18 months follow-up were included in the study. A total of 246 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients were evaluated, and all patients received detailed oral and written information about the risks of IR surgery. The patients who wished to receive IR surgery were called Group 1 (N\u00a0=\u00a0104), and the patients who did not wish to have surgery were called Group 2 (N\u00a0=\u00a0146). All patients were referred to a psychologist to complete the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), Symptom checklist-90-R (SCL-R-90), and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A).",
        "The mean age of the patients was 32.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.56. One hundred thirteen (45.9%) of the patients were male, and 133 were female (54%). Mean BAI and SCL-90-R were higher in Group 1 than Group 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Anxious and irritable temperament was higher in Group 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.035 respectively), and non-dominant and hyperthymic temperament was higher in Group 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.04 respectively).",
        "The level of anxiety and type of temperament is associated with the willingness to receive implant removal surgery in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. Measures to reduce anxiety levels may reduce the rate of unnecessary implant removal surgeries, associated patient care costs, and potential complications."
