        "The likelihood of reporting adolescent depression and/or anxiety was assessed for each SDMH using multinomial logistic regressions. All SDMH, besides caregiver underemployment, were associated with increased odds of reporting adolescent anxiety, depression, or anxiety and depression. Only household dysfunction ACEs and racism had statistically significant associations for all three mental health outcomes.",
        "Interventions targeting ACEs and racism may be more impactful in mitigating mental health challenges associated with SDMH during adolescence. The NSCH may provide an important public health tool to investigate SDMH in children."
