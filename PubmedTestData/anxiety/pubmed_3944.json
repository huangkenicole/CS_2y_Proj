        "Food allergy is a common allergic disease and often coexists with other allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema. Parents of children and young people with food allergy commonly experience stress and anxiety and this can significantly affect their child's mental health. Interventions that incorporate approaches from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can reduce stress and anxiety in parents of children and young people with food allergy and support healthy adjustment and psychological well-being in their children. However, access to psychological services is limited. This article uses reflection on a case study to illustrate the value of taking a CBT-informed intervention approach and to outline the potential role for nurses in its delivery. Research suggests that talking therapies may improve mental health and parenting behaviours in the parents of children and young people with a range of long-term conditions, so this article is also relevant to their care."
