        "Form A of the Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) was administered to 45 subjects approximately 24 hours prior to a surgical operation and Form B of the HIT was administered after surgery. A-State and A-trait were monitored by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) pre- and postsurgery. STAI A-State scores declined and STAI A-Trait scores remained stable from pre- to postsurgery. Among selected HIT variables, only Barrier scores remained stable and correlated (negatively) with STAI A-Trait scores. No HIT variables changed across periods and were correlated with STAI A-State scores obtained concurrently. Employing a multiple regression approach, a three-variable prediction model was derived for A-State and six-variable model was derived for A-Trait. In addition, the implications of the high number of rejected cards obtained in this study were discussed in terms of the possible inappropriateness of the HIT as an assessment tool under conditions of high situational stress."
