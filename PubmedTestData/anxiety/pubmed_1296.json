        "Managing anxiety is essential to control anxiety-related complications. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led video-based educational intervention on anxiety levels among patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention.",
        "A pre-test, post-test quasi-experimental design was used. Between June 2015 and July 2016, 99 participants were allocated to comparison versus intervention groups, and a video-based educational intervention about the percutaneous coronary intervention was provided to the intervention group. The State Anxiety Inventory was used to measure anxiety levels at baseline, 2\u00a0hours before, and 4 to 6\u00a0hours after a percutaneous coronary intervention.",
        "After providing the video-based intervention, at 2\u00a0hours before the procedure, results showed a statistically significant difference in anxiety mean scores (33.08 versus 60.88) between the intervention and comparison groups, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). At 4 to 6\u00a0hours after the procedure, the anxiety mean score for the intervention group (M\u00a0=\u00a024.1) was statistically significantly lower than that of the comparison group (M\u00a0=\u00a044.17; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "A pre-procedure nurse-led educational intervention provided by video had a significant effect on reducing anxiety levels among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients in the intervention group experienced a steady and consistent trend of anxiety reduction pre-cutaneous and post-percutaneous coronary intervention."
