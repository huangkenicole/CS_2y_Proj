        "This paper compares the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD Scale) and a Linear Analogue Anxiety Scale (LAAS) for evaluating anxiety in patients with acute ischaemic heart disease. The instruments were examined for correlation, reliability and internal consistency. Strong associations were demonstrated at pre-test between the STAI and the other scales. Moderate coefficients between HAD-A and HAD-D/LAAS were also apparent. Lower correlations were found at post-test than at pre-test. At post-test, strong inter-correlations occurred for STAI/LAAS. The HAD Scale demonstrated high test-retest reliability, while the STAI and LAAS were moderate in their reliability in this sample. The adequate correlation between the instruments suggest that each is a valid and appropriate measure of anxiety in this clinical sample."
