        "Differences in symptom burden, treatment satisfaction and autonomy between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis could be reflected by a difference in symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to assess differences in prevalence and symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.",
        "Baseline data from the Depression Related Factors and Outcomes in Dialysis Patients With Various Ethnicities and Races Study were used. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory- second edition. Linear and logistic regression models were used to compare anxiety and depression total scores and somatic and subjective/cognitive symptom dimension scores between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis, adjusted for potential confounders.",
        "In total, 84 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and 601 patients receiving haemodialysis were included. Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in respectively 22% and 43% of the patients, with no differences between dialysis modality. Both modalities scored high on the somatic symptom dimensions and on individual somatic items. Almost all patients reported symptoms related to loss of energy and sleep.",
        "No differences in symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression were found between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. The high prevalence of somatic symptom dimensions in both groups underscores the possible interaction between somatic and psychiatric symptoms in dialysis patients and the need for early recognition and treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression regardless of treatment modalities."
