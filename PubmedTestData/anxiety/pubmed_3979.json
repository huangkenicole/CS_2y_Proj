        "Cognitive-behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for children and adolescents with anxiety. Despite its efficacy, a recent United Kingdom study indicated that few children with anxiety disorders receive cognitive-behavioural therapy. The primary aim of this study was to examine the receipt of cognitive-behavioural therapy for children and adolescents with elevated anxiety symptoms in Australia. Second, this study also examined whether there was a difference in the type of treatment received based on socioeconomic status and geographical location.",
        "Using self-reported questionnaires, parents of children aged 4-18\u2009years and children aged 12-18\u2009years (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009784; elevated anxiety symptom sample <i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009169) were recruited from four samples: community (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009164), school (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009177), clinic (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200916) and online panel provider (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009427). Participants reported on the child's anxiety symptoms and the type of treatment (if any) the child received for their anxiety symptoms.",
        "Results indicated that 19.5% of children and adolescents with elevated anxiety symptoms received evidence-based treatment (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy). Of those families who did seek help for anxiety in Australia, the majority (66.3%) did not receive cognitive-behavioural therapy. In addition, neither socioeconomic status (which was based on the Australian Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage [ICSEA]) nor location (metropolitan vs regional/remote) affected whether individuals received evidence-based care or non-evidence-based care.",
        "Overall, children and adolescents in this study seeking support for their anxiety symptoms were not receiving adequate evidence-based care, regardless of socioeconomic status and location. These findings indicate there is a need to increase the receipt of cognitive-behavioural therapy for children and adolescents with anxiety symptoms. The findings should tentatively be interpreted, given data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic."
