        "The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between addictive smartphone use (ASU) and depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep quality in elderly adults.",
        "The study sample included smartphone users over the age of 65\u2009years. The research data were obtained from social networking sites via a Google survey link. In addition to filling out a sociodemographic data form, the participants were also assessed with Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS), Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index tools.",
        "The correlation analysis revealed the SAS score to be positively correlated with depression and anxiety, and negatively correlated with sleep quality. In the regression analysis, depressive symptoms, anxiety level and sleep quality were all found to have an effect on the SAS total score. Furthermore, the SAS score was found to have an effect on depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep quality.",
        "Our findings reveal a bidirectional relationship between ASU and depressive, anxiety symptoms and impaired sleep quality in elderly adults. It is important to question smartphone use patterns in people with sleep problems, symptoms of depression or anxiety."
