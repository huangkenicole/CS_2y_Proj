        "A radical prostatectomy might lead to an impaired quality of life. Aim of the study was to analyse the impact of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation on psychosocial and physical outcomes in patients after surgery.",
        "Six hundred nineteen inpatients and 95 outpatients, treated for localized prostate cancer by prostatectomy, completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and two quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25) at the beginning and end of rehabilitation as well as 12\u00a0months after rehabilitation. Data were analysed by using t-tests, chi(2) - tests and analyses of variance with repeated measures.",
        "Compared to a population sample, patients reported a significantly worse quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and more anxiety (HADS) at the beginning of rehabilitation. Physical, role and social functioning increased significantly over time for in- and outpatients. Patients still reported lower emotional functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30), anxiety (HADS) and prostate cancer-specific physical symptoms (EORTC QLQ-PR25) 1\u00a0year after rehabilitation, although symptom levels decreased significantly over time. The setting did not have an independent significant effect in the multivariate model.",
        "In- and outpatients reported an increased quality of life 1\u00a0year after rehabilitation with respect to their physical constitution and their reintegration into social life. Nonetheless, both groups still struggled with problems due to surgery. The results indicated that both settings seem to be supportive in the recovery process but that patients seem to require additional support with aftercare for treating surgery-related problems as well as emotional discomfort."
