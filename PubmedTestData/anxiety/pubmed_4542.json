      "AbstractText": [
        "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the practical applications of virtual reality (VR) in healthcare. One discussed application of this technology is to reduce anxiety during procedures for paediatric patients. Following skin loss in paediatric patients, careful management of the wound with appropriate dressings and frequent dressing changes is a key part of the treatment process. In children, continued dressing changes are often a source of anxiety, which complicates procedures causing distress to the child, their parents and staff members. VR systems have the potential to not only reduce anxiety but also pain in children requiring frequent dressing changes. Although our knowledge of this technology is improving, further research is needed to evaluate its full potential in this population and to establish guidelines to take advantage of the full potential of VR technology."
