        "We aimed to investigate anxiety level of caregivers of neurological patients with dysphagia, and the relationship of patient-related factors to anxiety level of dysphagia caregivers. A total of 103 adult neurological patients with dysphagia (study group), 30 without dysphagia (control group), and their primary caregivers were included. Types of feeding, condition of dependency in eating and drinking, dysphagia duration, and history of previous dysphagia treatment were recorded for study group. In study group, the Turkish version of the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (T-EAT-10) was used to determine dysphagia symptom severity. Penetration and aspiration severity was determined with the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) that has two subscales including state anxiety (S-STAI) and trait anxiety (T-STAI) was used to determine anxiety level of caregivers. There was no difference between groups in terms of age, gender, weight, and height. The mean S-STAI was 42.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.10 for the study group and 29.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.64 for the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mean T-STAI was 44.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.98 for the study group and 29.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.46 for the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Significant correlation was detected between only T-STAI and history of previous dysphagia treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, r\u00a0=\u00a00.25). No correlation was found between STAI (in terms of both S-STAI and T-STAI) and T-EAT-10, PAS, types of feeding, condition of dependency in eating and drinking, dysphagia duration (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Caregivers of neurological patients with dysphagia have greater anxiety level than caregivers of neurological patients without dysphagia."
