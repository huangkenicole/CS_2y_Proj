        "The present study examined predictors of treatment outcome among children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-five participants (8-13 years) participated in a 12-session cognitive behavioral group treatment (CBT). Potential predictors were the pre-treatment severity of anxious symptoms assessed from both the child's and parent's perspective as well as depressive symptoms (child report only) and general emotional distress in parent (parent self-report). Furthermore, the relationship between treatment outcome and child's self-reported pre-post changes in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation was investigated. Pre-treatment level of social anxiety reported by the child was a significant predictor for outcome, i.e. children with higher levels of social anxiety at pretreatment reported a greater reduction in social anxiety at post-treatment. Reduction in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation both predicted reduction in social anxiety, although not independently. The results suggest that tailoring intervention to include strategies for emotion regulation of anxiety may improve treatment outcome."
