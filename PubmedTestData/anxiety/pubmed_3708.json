        "Opiates and benzodiazepines are commonly used during invasive coronary angiography (ICA) to address pain and anxiety. In the United States (US), these medications are used in more than 90% of such cases. The utility of these medications during ICA has not been addressed by the scientific societies. The goals of this study were to evaluate the impact of music on the use of opiates and benzodiazepines and levels of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing ICA.",
        "In this prospective pilot study, a total of 72 subjects undergoing elective ICA were randomized to receive planned pharmacologic standard conscious sedation (SCS), including opiates and/or benzodiazepines pre-ICA vs music plus opiates and/or benzodiazepines as needed. Pain and anxiety levels, as well as use of SCS medications, were monitored during the periprocedural period.",
        "Baseline characteristics, including rates of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders, were similar between the SCS and music groups. The levels of pain and anxiety were relatively low and similar between the two cohorts during the peri-ICA period. There was a trend toward less frequent use of SCS medications in the music group (62.2% in the SCS group vs 40.0% in the music group; P=.06) and significantly less use of midazolam per case in the music group (0.68 mg in the SCS group vs 0.37 mg in the music group; P=.048). SCS medication use also differed significantly between the two operators.",
        "Listening to patient-selected music during the peri-ICA period may reduce the need for pharmacologic conscious sedation without adversely affecting pain and anxiety levels."
