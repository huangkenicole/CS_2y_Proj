        "<b>Purpose:</b> To investigate the experience and outcomes for care partnerships (e.g., spouses, caregivers) who have post-stroke anxiety and/or depression symptoms and used an online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) together. <b>Design:</b> Explanatory sequential mixed methods case study research. <b>Methods:</b> 5 care partnerships (10 participants) received online MBI, and data was collected in weeks 0, 4, and 8. Data collection involved the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, the Mutuality Scale, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and post-intervention interviews. Clinical effectiveness was evaluated using minimal clinically important difference (MCID). <b>Findings:</b> Participants improved mindfulness (80%) and mutuality (30%). MCID was achieved for anxiety symptoms (50%) and depression symptoms (20%). IPA found evidence of conflicting and contradictory experiences so dialectical tension was used to articulate the continuum of perspectives and themes produced in the analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Care partnerships using online MBIs can experience improvements in mindfulness, mutuality, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms. The findings are complex but show the potential value of online MBI for some care partnerships living with stroke."
