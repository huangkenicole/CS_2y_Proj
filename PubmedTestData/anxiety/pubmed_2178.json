        "Cast room procedures can be a source of anxiety for children. Various techniques, including music therapy, have been evaluated as a way to ease this anxiety. The use of iPads as a form of distraction during cast room procedures has not previously been evaluated and was the purpose of the current study.",
        "146 children and adolescents who underwent cast room procedures during June- August 2015 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: no-iPad, iPad with video, or iPad with game. Patient heart rates were measured using a pulse oximeter in the waiting room, before the procedure, during the procedure, and after the procedure. Mean values for each group were calculated at each time interval and compared both between groups and within groups over time.",
        "There were no significant differences in baseline (waiting room) heart rate between the no-iPad and iPad groups. When compared with the no-iPad group, there was a trend toward decreased heart rate in the video group (p=0.13) and a significant increase in heart rate in the game group (p=0.026) before the procedure. There were no significant decreases in heart rate within any of the groups when comparing the waiting room heart rates with the during procedure heart rates. There was a significant difference between the no-iPad and video groups (p=0.047) when comparing the change in heart rate from baseline to before the procedure, with a decreased heart rate observed in the video group.",
        "The results of this study show a significant decrease in heart rate when transitioning from the waiting room to the cast room while watching videos on the iPad. iPad-based video delivery appears to decrease anxiety prior to cast room procedures. iPad-based game play is difficult to assess as elevations in heart rate prior to the procedure are presumed to be related to game play and confound the observed effect it may have on anxiety related to the procedure."
