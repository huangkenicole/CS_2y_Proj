        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early medical intervention for psychosocial problems detected in adolescents in a school health checkup, with the broader goal of prevention of these problems in adolescents.",
        "The Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items score and scores for five subscales (physical symptoms, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy, and family function), and an investigation of lifestyle were determined in a school health checkup for 5th grade elementary to 3rd grade junior high school students. Forty-three children were found to be at high risk for psychosomatic disorder, of whom 18 then received a medical intervention (early intervention group) and 25 did not (non-intervention group). Fifty-seven children (outpatient group) treated for psychosomatic disorder for \u22643\u2009months were also included in the study. The Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items (QTA30) was completed by all participants every 3\u2009months for 1\u2009year and scores were compared among the groups.",
        "In the early intervention group, total Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items scores; physical, depression, and anxiety symptoms; and unstable relationships with friends and teachers at school all significantly improved after 1\u2009year compared to the first survey. None of these items improved in the non-intervention group, while the outpatient group had gradual improvement in all scores. Family function scores in the early intervention group improved over time, whereas those in the non-intervention group worsened.",
        "Early detection of children at high risk for psychosomatic disorder at a school health checkup and early medical intervention were useful for prevention of psychosomatic disorder in adolescents."
