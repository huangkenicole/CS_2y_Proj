        "Some evidence suggests that anxiety deteriorate the immune system. We aimed to determine the effect of anxiety on COVID-19 infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Our study was conducted with 80 HD patients. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) questionnaires were administered between April 15 and May 1, 2020. These patients were followed up for about 8\u00a0months and COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death rates were recorded. Twenty-one (26%) of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Fourteen out of twenty one (66.6%) of the patients were hospitalized, and 8/21 (38%) of them died due to COVID-19. STAI-S (p= 0.006) and BAI (p= 0.021) scores were found to be higher and STAI-T (p= 0.040) score was found to be lower in HD patients who were infected with COVID-19 compared to without, at the follow-up period. It might be concluded in this study that COVID-19 was more common in anxious HD patients."
