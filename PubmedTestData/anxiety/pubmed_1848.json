        "Anxiety is a common and impairing condition in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Evidence supports the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for treating anxiety in this population; however, available treatment protocols may be difficult to implement outside of research settings. The present study examined the efficacy of family-based exposure-focused treatment (FET) compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) control in 32 youth aged 6-17\u00a0years with ASD and co-occurring anxiety. Fourteen youth were randomized to FET, which included 12 face-to-face weekly therapy sessions lasing 45-55\u00a0min, while 18 youth completed the TAU control where engagement in psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy was at the discretion of the families. Results strongly supported FET with a 79% (versus 0% in TAU) response rate, 86% (versus 0% in TAU) remission in primary anxiety diagnosis, and large between-group effects on clinician-rated anxiety severity and most parent-rated domains of anxiety-related impairment. Among treatment responders, 2-month follow-up supported maintenance of gains. Overall, the study supported FET as a relatively brief intervention for the treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD, although further research is needed to replicate these findings and compare FET outcomes to more comprehensive interventions."
