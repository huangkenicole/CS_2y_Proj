        "The mental health of adults with ADHD was compared to neurotypical controls, and associations between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and mental health were examined.",
        "Seventy-two participants (<i>n</i> = 36 with ADHD) completed demographic questions assessing ADHD and mental health symptoms. CRF was estimated using the 6-Minute Walk Test and a self-perception question.",
        "Those with ADHD had significantly poorer mental health outcomes than controls (<i>p</i> < .001), with 50% of adults with ADHD reporting severe to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Critically, lower CRF was associated with worse depression, anxiety, and stress (all <i>p</i> \u2264 .03) across both groups. Within the ADHD group, those with higher estimated CRF had significantly lower stress. Among participants with less severe ADHD symptoms, those with higher perceived CRF had significantly lower depressive symptoms.",
        "In our cross-sectional study, participants with ADHD had poorer mental health than neurotypical controls, and higher fitness was associated with better mental health."
