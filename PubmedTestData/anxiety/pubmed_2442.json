        "Research has uncovered a wide range of predictors of youth anxiety treatment outcome (i.e., symptom severity and diagnostic remission). Youth's social functioning is one predictor that has been rarely studied, however, which is a significant gap given its importance to development and clinical functioning. We address this gap by examining two aspects of youth's social functioning as predictors of anxiety treatment outcome: (1) positive social interactions and (2) social skills. We further examined the moderating roles of treatment arm (child- or parent-based treatment), diagnosis (presence or absence of social anxiety disorder), and youth gender, between each of the two predictors and treatment response and remission. Participants were 96 youths with anxiety disorders (6-16 years; 54% girls) and their mothers, who completed diagnostic interviews and questionnaires at baseline and posttreatment. Multiple regression models revealed that higher baseline parent-reports of their child's social skills predicted lower posttreatment anxiety symptom severity for youth with social anxiety disorder. Modified linear probability models revealed that baseline youth-reports of their social skills predicted remission from anxiety diagnoses for youths assigned to the parent-based treatment. Baseline youth-reports of their positive social interactions and parent-reports of youth social skills predicted remission from anxiety diagnoses for girls. Results contribute to the predictor literature by highlighting the importance of youth social functioning to anxiety treatment outcome."
