Anxiety as a personality characteristic was examined by a clinical inquiry as well as by the test for anxiety of Taylor and acute and chronic stress actions were search for. 228 girls at the age of 15 and 18 years were investigated. Diagnosis \"psychogenic amenorrhea\" was established in 34 out of 228 girls. In regard to physical and sexual development there was not significant difference with the girls of the control group. There was direct connection between stress event and the disturbance in the menstrual cycle in 41.2% of the examined girls.

Third degree according to Taylor-mean manifested anxiety was established in 26% of the girls of the control group. Inferences are made in connection with the therapy."
