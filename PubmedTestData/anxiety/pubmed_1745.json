        "The purpose of the project was to answer the following question: Does the implementation of aromatherapy before surgery reduce preoperative anxiety in adult surgical patients undergoing elective surgery?",
        "This evidence-based project was a quality improvement initiative that used pre- and poststate anxiety evaluations to determine the effect of aromatherapy on preoperative anxiety among adults undergoing elective surgery.",
        "The project team conducted a literature review to evaluate the appropriateness of using aromatherapy to decrease preoperative anxiety. The team delivered pre- and postaromatherapy State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAIAD) Short form Y-1 questionnaire and administered an aromatherapy diffuser clip comprised of three evidence-based scented oils to determine the effect of aromatherapy on preoperative anxiety among adults undergoing elective surgery.",
        "Pre- and postaromatherapy (STAIAD) Short Form Y-1 questionnaires indicated that exposure to aromatherapy significantly reduced preoperative anxiety. There was a statistically and clinically significant difference in state anxiety score after aromatherapy exposure, with a mean state change of 17.42 points (P < .001). This exceeded the effect size benchmark derived from the evidence, which defined a significant change in state score as 5 points. Participants above the median age exhibited the most profound decrease in anxiety regardless of gender. Qualitative survey responses indicated that 96% of patients would use preoperative aromatherapy in the future and 91% experienced increased satisfaction with their perioperative care.",
        "Heightened physiological response to increased anxiety leads to increased perioperative nausea and vomiting, higher pain scores, and susceptibility to prolonged recovery from surgery. Implementing aromatherapy can reduce anxiety, thereby attenuating these complications and preventing additional accrued cost. Furthermore, this evidence-based project has the added benefit of increasing overall patient satisfaction with the perioperative process."
