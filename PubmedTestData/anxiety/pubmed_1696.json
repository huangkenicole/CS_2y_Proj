        "This study aimed to determine the effect of music as an intervention on relieving preoperative anxiety in patients with dental fear in an outpatient operating room (OR) before intravenous sedation (IVS).",
        "Sixty adult patients with dental fear undergoing dental surgery under IVS were divided into 2 groups (music and nonmusic). The music group listened to music in the waiting room until immediately before the initiation of IVS whereas the nonmusic group did not. Patient anxiety was objectively measured using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to assess the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio as an indication of sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system activity. Subjective preoperative anxiety was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS).",
        "Heart rate variability analysis failed to demonstrate any significant difference between the 2 groups from baseline to start of IVS. There were also no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding changes in VAS scores.",
        "Music intervention was not found to reduce preoperative anxiety in patients with dental fear before IVS in the dental outpatient OR as determined by HRV analysis or VAS scores."
