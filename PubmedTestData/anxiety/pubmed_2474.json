        "Hysterosalpingography is a stressful procedure that causes pain and anxiety. Therefore, measures must be taken to reduce or eliminate the pain and anxiety associated with it.",
        "This paper investigated the effect of virtual reality (VR) during hysterosalpingography on pain, anxiety, fear, physiological parameters, and satisfaction.",
        "A randomized controlled trial design was used. Patients were randomized into two groups (VR group\u00a0=\u00a031, control group\u00a0=\u00a031). The study was conducted between April 26 and June 30, 2022. Anxiety was evaluated using the State Anxiety Inventory. Pain, fear, and satisfaction were evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were followed up.",
        "There was a significant difference in the mean VAS scores during and 15\u00a0min after hysterosalpingography between the VR and control groups. There was no significant difference in the mean SAI scores between the groups. The VR group participants were significantly more satisfied with hysterosalpingography than the control group. There was no significant difference in physiological parameters just before, immediately after, and 15\u00a0min after hysterosalpingography between the groups.",
        "Virtual reality helps patients experience less pain and fear and makes them more satisfied with hysterosalpingography. However, it does not affect their anxiety and vital signs. Patients are highly satisfied with VR technology."
