        "In the paper there are presented the results of a study of anxiety and balance ofparts of autonomous nervous system in healthy children 5-7 years old, residing in different parts of Magnitogorsk. It is shown that state of heightened and high alert was shown to be more common among children living on the left bank of the Urals river around the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Integrated Plant. In these children an imbalance in the work of the parts of the autonomic nervous system was detected more frequently, at that shifts were observed mainly in the direction to ergotropic tone. At the same time balanced work of the parts of the autonomic nervous system was observed more frequently in children living on the right bank of the Urals river. Discovered psychosomatic features of examined children turned out to be associated with both the social characteristics of family lifestyle and the emotional stress of parents, and the contents of some organic compounds in total snow samples collected in the territories of kindergartens which they attended. One ofthe most significant results ofthe work we consider the detection of a correlation relationship between emotional stress of parents and activity of key enzymes in their children, reflecting the protective and adaptive reactions of the organism. On the basis of these and previously obtained data, we suggest that social and psychological factors of the family are not only a potential source of maladaptation of the child, but, probably, can have an impact on the stability and sensitivity of the genome of children."
