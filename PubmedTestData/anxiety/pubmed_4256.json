        "Use of a stress ball is a known t non-pharmacological method to distract attention and to relieve stress and anxiety. The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of stress ball use on anxiety and depression in hemodialysis patients.",
        "The study utilized a single-blind, balanced crossover design. There were two sequential 4-week intervention periods separated by a 4-day washout period. During one intervention period stress ball use at home was encouraged while the other 4-week \"intervention\" period served as a control. The order in which the two evaluation periods were applied was randomized for a given patient. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale before and after each 4-week intervention period.",
        "A total of 65 patients participated in this study. There were statistically significant reductions in both anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001) during the stress ball intervention periods vs. no change during the control interventions. A delayed follow-up evaluation showed that the anxiety level of patients remained reduced after 1\u2009month of no longer using a stress ball.",
        "The use of a stress ball at home for 4\u2009weeks significantly decreased anxiety and depression levels in our group of hemodialysis patients."
