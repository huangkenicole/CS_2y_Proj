        "To examine the role of family support and coping in the adjustment of adolescents with chronic illness (CI) transitioning into college, college freshmen and sophomores (N(chronic illness)=32, N(primarily negative life event)=53, N(primarily positive life event)=16) were administered standard measures. CI group reported more anxiety and a trend towards more depression than the primarily positive life events group (PLE). Coping strategy (active and passive) was positively associated with anxiety in CI group, whereas, family support was negatively associated with depression and anxiety in the primarily negative life events group (NLE), and passive coping was positively associated with depression in PLE. Development of adaptive coping should be the focus of programs aimed at supporting students with CI as they transition to college."
