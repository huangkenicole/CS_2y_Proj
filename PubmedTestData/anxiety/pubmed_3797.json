        "The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between anxiety sensitivity, as measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), and four dimensions of behavioural reactivity to a single inhalation of 35% carbon dioxide (CO(2)) in 31 patients with panic disorder. ASI scores correlated positively with baseline State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores but did not correlate with post-CO(2) scores. Correlational analyses revealed a significant, albeit modest, correlation between anxiety sensitivity and cognitive symptoms induced with CO(2). However, no significant association was found between anxiety sensitivity and other dimensions of CO(2)-induced anxiety, including severity of somatic symptoms, subjective levels of anxiety, fear or apprehension, and fear of the somatic symptoms induced by CO(2). Overall, these data do not support the view that anxiety sensitivity plays a key role in mediating behavioural sensitivity to CO(2) inhalation in panic disorder."
