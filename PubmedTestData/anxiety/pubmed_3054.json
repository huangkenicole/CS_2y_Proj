        "To assess whether nonpharmacological adjuvant interventions could improve outcomes among patients receiving ART.",
        "Electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2017,\u00a0using keywords such as \"fertility treatment,\" \"emotional distress,\" and \"clinical\u00a0pregnancy.\"",
        "Reports of randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of nonpharmacological interventions on emotional disorders and the pregnancy rate in patients receiving ART published in any language were included.",
        "Data were extracted into a predesigned form. Psychological ratings were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMDs). Heterogeneity was assessed. The primary outcome measures were psychological ratings at baseline and after intervention.",
        "Overall, 34 randomized controlled trials, with a total of 7213 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Nonpharmacological interventions reduced anxiety when compared with control interventions (SMD 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.42; I<sup>2</sup> =85%), but they had no significant effects on depression and infertility distress.",
