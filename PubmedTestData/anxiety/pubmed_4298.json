        "Data on the effect of acutely administered serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in animal anxiety models have been inconsistent. In some of the models these compounds showed anxiolytic properties, while in others they were ineffective or even anxiogenic. In the foot shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) test in the adult rat, SSRIs were reported to be effective, however, they were only tested with protocols using multiple shocking design. In the present study, anxiolytic effects of various SSRI compounds (sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, escitalopram) were tested in three distinct USV test protocols in comparison with alprazolam and 8-OH-DPAT. In the single shocking protocol, animals were exposed to one shocking session after the drug treatment. In the multiple shocking protocol, rats went through a foot shock priming session before each drug test. On priming days animals received foot shocks without drug treatment. On the test day (the day after), rats received drug treatment and then were shocked again. In the context conditioning protocol animals were exposed to foot shocks on two consecutive days before the drug test. On the third, test day, after drug treatment animals were replaced to the shocking chamber, but this time shocks were not delivered. SSRIs were ineffective using the single shocking protocol. In the context conditioned protocol, all SSRIs showed linear dose-response relationship with ED50 values of 8.5, 2.2, 0.77 and 0.93 mg/kg i.p. for fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and escitalopram, respectively. Using the multiple shocking protocol, SSRIs were only partially effective with maximum inhibitions ranging between 44% and 62%. In contrast to SSRIs, the benzodiazepine anxiolytics, alprazolam showed anxiolytic activity with linear dose-response relationship in all of the test protocols, with ED50 values varying from 1.3 to 4.0 mg/kg i.p. The serotonin 5HT1A receptor antagonist 8-OH-DPAT also showed linear dose-response relationship in all protocols, but this compound was less potent in the single shocking design (ED50 values were 0.27, 0.04 and 0.07 mg/kg i.p. in the single shocking, multiple shocking and context conditioned protocol, respectively). In conclusion, our results show that priming has a major impact on the effectiveness of SSRIs in the USV test, and the three test protocols applied in this study have different predictive and face validity."
