        "This study was conducted with family members of patients' in the intensive care unit (ICU) to identify their anxiety level, social support and satisfaction with the ICU.",
        "Admission of critical patients to the ICU usually involves the participation of family members.",
        "A descriptive-correlational design was used and reported according to the STROBE checklist.",
        "The sample consisted of 250 family members in ICUs in a city of Turkey. Data were collected by the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit scale.",
        "A negative correlation was found between family satisfaction of the ICU and state anxiety (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.349, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a negative relationship between the satisfaction of the ICU and trait anxiety of the participants (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.151, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a significant relationship between the state anxiety level (Adjusted R\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.080, F\u00a0=\u00a08.247, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), trait anxiety level (Adjusted R\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.185, F\u00a0=\u00a019.821, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), the perceived social support (Adjusted R\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.094, F\u00a0=\u00a09.640, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and satisfaction (Adjusted R\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.013, F\u00a0=\u00a04.161, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) of family members and their sociodemographic characteristics.",
        "The study concluded that anxiety levels of relatives of the families were high, their social support and satisfaction with the intensive care unit were at a moderate level. There was a correlation between anxiety levels, satisfaction with the intensive care unit, and the perceived social support of families.",
        "Holistic care for the psychosocial needs of families who have a member in the ICU should be planned to increase satisfaction. Nurses should observe families closely for anxiety, allow them to ask questions and include them in the care of their family member."
