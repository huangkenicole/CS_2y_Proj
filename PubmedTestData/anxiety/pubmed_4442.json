        "Specific assessment of anxiety and depression is not included in routine preoperative evaluation; therefore, in cases of cardiac diseases in which the emotional status of the patient may be modified by the disease those disorders may not be diagnosed. The objective of the present study was to compare the level and prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with cardiac disease undergoing invasive and/or surgical procedures using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD.",
        "After approval by the Ethics Committee, 96 patients, physical status ASA II and III, were divided in three groups: electrophysiological study (EPS), pacemaker (PM) placement, and myocardial revascularization (MR). 'Cutting points' were as follows: HAD-anxiety scale (HAD-A) with anxiety > 9; HAD-depression scale (HAD-D) with depression > 9.",
        "All three groups were homogenous regarding sociodemographic parameters. Statistically significant differences were observed among the three groups (p = 0.006; p = 0.034) in the level and prevalence of anxiety (HAD-A); and in the intergroup comparison of the anxiety level significant differences were observed between the EPS x MR and EPS x PM groups (p < 0.05). Significant differences in the level and prevalence of depression (HAD-D) among the study groups were not observed.",
        "Patients with cardiac diseases undergoing electrophysiological studies, pacemaker implantation, and myocardial revascularization have different levels and prevalence of anxiety, but they do not show differences in the level and prevalence of depression."
