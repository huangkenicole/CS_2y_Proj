        "In this multi-methods study we explored the characteristics, causes and impact of anxiety in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) from the perspective of young males with DMD and their parents. Eight young males with DMD (7-18 years) and 14 parents participated in separate focus groups. Perspectives on anxiety were explored using semi-structured interview schedules. Themes were identified using Framework Analysis. Neurodevelopmental, emotional and behavioural symptom scores were obtained using standard instruments including the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. We identified six common anxiety characteristics: Catastrophic conclusions; Rigidly-held anxieties; Extreme distress; Social anxieties; Physical changes/needs; Unexpected/unfamiliar. Four further themes described influential systemic factors: Individual, Family, and Social responses and Physical environment and service contexts. All DMD participants had significantly higher total difficulties, emotional problems and impact scores than population norms. The Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale showed low sensitivity in identifying anxiety symptoms. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of parents who had wanted help for their son's anxiety were dissatisfied with the available support. In conclusion, anxiety can severely impact wellbeing and functioning of individuals with DMD. There are important nuances to consider when managing DMD-associated anxiety. We highlight the importance of multimodal assessment considering the multiple contexts within which anxiety arises."
