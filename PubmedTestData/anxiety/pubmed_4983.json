      "AbstractText": [
        "A major part of COPD patients suffers from anxiety. The presence of an anxiety or stress disorder compromises their quality of life. Anxiety and (posttraumatic) stress disorders may be treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT encompasses different treatment interventions and protocols. Some of these interventions have been investigated to treat anxiety in patients with COPD. Those that have been proven to be effective, should be offered to COPD patients with anxiety. Examples are: education about symptoms in COPD (mostly dyspnea) and the bodily anxiety response; education about the positive and negative anxiety and breathing circle; breathing, posture and relaxation exercises; identification and correction of catastrophic thoughts; setting goals and planning activities (behavior activation) and pacing."
