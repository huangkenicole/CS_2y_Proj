        "The postnatal period is considered the most challenging period in the adjustment to fatherhood. This study aimed to assess anxiety levels among fathers during this period.",
        "A comparative study assessing the anxiety levels of first-time and multi-child fathers before the mother and child returned home (0-7\u00a0days after birth) was conducted. We used the French validation of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).",
        "Among 235 fathers who were met at the maternity ward, 182 (77\u00a0%) responded to the questionnaire. For most fathers in both groups, anxiety levels were low or very low for trait anxiety (166/182, 91.21\u00a0%) and state anxiety (177/182, 97.25\u00a0%). Levels of state anxiety were statistically higher for first-time fathers compared to multi-child fathers but were mainly at a low or very low level (70/83 [84\u00a0%] versus 71/99 [71\u00a0%], respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029). The multiple linear regression showed that \"feeling prepared at birth time\" was the only significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) associated factor with state anxiety among first-time fathers only.",
        "The validity and reliability of the STAI have been widely proven for the general population but not specifically for men during the postpartum period.",
        "Most fathers had low to very low anxiety levels during the early postpartum period, suggesting that developing new specific support interventions is not needed during early postnatal care. Further research focusing on when the family is back home is warranted."
