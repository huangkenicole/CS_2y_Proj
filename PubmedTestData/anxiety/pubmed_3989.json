        "Self-rated health (SRH) is a single question with which general health status is assessed.",
        "To study whether SRH (i) is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, concurrently and after three years, (ii) predicts the course over time for meeting a cutoff for depression and anxiety, and (iii) predicts development of depression and anxiety after three years.",
        "Population-based questionnaire data from northern Sweden were used. In total, 2336 individuals participated at baseline and three-year follow-up. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to quantify symptoms of depression and anxiety. Categorical and continuous data were used for analyses to complement each other.",
        "Regarding prevalence, the analyses showed three- to four-fold increased odds for depression and anxiety at three-year follow-up, and two- to three-fold odds for their development at three-year follow-up. SRH at baseline was also found to be a significant, but weak, predictor of depression and anxiety severity and worsening at follow-up as well as being a predictor over time for meeting a cutoff for depression and anxiety.",
        "Assessment of SRH may be used in general practice to identify individuals who qualify for further evaluation of depression and anxiety."
