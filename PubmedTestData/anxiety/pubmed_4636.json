        "In recent years, Japan has promoted home visits to support older adults, with caregivers playing an important role. However, caregivers generally experience a high frequency of anxiety and depression, and the factors associated with these conditions among home visit caregivers remain unknown. To identify the associated factors, we conducted a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study of home visit caregivers in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. The survey included caregivers' Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;sociodemographic items of patients and caregivers;and caregivers' perceptions of the home care environment, patients, and themselves. The questionnaires were sent to 379 caregivers;203 responded (53.6% response rate), of which 173 were valid (85.2% valid response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.9% and 69.4%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis of factors associated with anxiety and depression showed that stable family finances (OR:0.69, 95% CI:0.48-1.00, p=0.049) and stable caregiver health (OR:0.45, 95% CI:0.30-0.68, p<0.001) were associated with anxiety. Further, stable family finances (OR:0.60, 95% CI:0.38-0.93, p=0.022), stable caregiver health (OR:0.49, 95% CI:0.30-0.81, p=0.005), and stable patient condition (OR:0.51, 95% CI:0.29-0.92, p=0.025) were associated with depression. These findings demonstrate that caregiver wellbeing is essential in home care settings. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 443-449, August, 2023."
