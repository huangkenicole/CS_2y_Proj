        "High variability in adaptive behavior in cognitively-able adults with autism spectrum disorder has been previously reported, and may be caused by the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in this population. This study's goals were to examine self-reported psychiatric symptoms in students with ASD, and to identify their relative contribution to the variance in adaptive behaviors. The study population included 95 students: 55 diagnosed with ASD (4 females; age range 18-34) who participated in a university integration program (ASD group), and 40 regularly matriculated students (non-ASD group, 7 females; age range 20-36). The ASD group showed a lower adaptive skill level than the non-ASD group as measured by the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (GAC-ABAS). Significantly higher scores for the ASD group were found for social anxiety, trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression symptoms. The level of adaptive skills correlated negatively and significantly with the severity of social anxiety symptoms in both groups and with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only in the ASD group. Additionally, in a regression model, significant contributions of having an ASD diagnosis and severity of social anxiety explained 41.7% of the variance in adaptive skills. Adequate evaluation and treatment, if needed, are recommended in this population."
