        "The literature contains contradictory reports on the psychiatric status of individuals with sexual dysfunction. As a step toward resolving the controversy the authors administered the SCL-90-R to a large series of patients who sought treatment for sexual disorders (N = 325). Psychiatric evaluations were also done for each patient. Results showed disproportionate levels of psychological distress, reflected in SCL-90-R symptom profiles; approximately one-third of the 199 men and one-half of the 126 women in the series were also assigned psychiatric diagnoses. Findings provided evidence suggesting that the various sexual dysfunctions have characteristic symptom profiles; however, interpretation should be cautious because the cause-and-effect relationship between psychological distress and sexual dysfunctions remains complex and uncharted."
