        "The clinical effect of implementing health education in ministration elderly hypertensive sufferers is analyzed. Two hundred hypertensive sufferers admitted to our hospital from February 2020 to April 2021 are selected. The two sets of sufferers are randomly divided into the examination set and the control set using the random number table method, with 100 cases in each set. The control set is given routine ministration care, and the examination set is given routine ministration to implement health education; these indicators include: the blood pressure control compliance, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) scores; the compliance rate of health knowledge score, serum Angiotensin II (Ang II), Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) standards, medication compliance, prognosis quality of life, and cumulative occurrence of MACCE are compared. The experimental results show that the application of health education in the ministration process of elderly hypertensive sufferers can effectively enhance the blood pressure of the sufferers, reduce the negative emotions and psychological pressure of the sufferers, enhance the quality of life of the sufferers, and reduce the prognosis of recurrence and the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events."
