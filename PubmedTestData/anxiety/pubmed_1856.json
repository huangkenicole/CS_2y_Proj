        "With the purpose of completely approaching the patient in the hospital, this research had the goal to identify the generating factors of the of anxiety patient and how they express their uneasiness towards the illness and the hospitalization the data were collected from april/may/96 with adults in a school-hospital and was based on a guide for observation of the anxieting situations and in an interview guide. We found out that the patients' major concerns were: Knowing if their illness has aure, how long they will be there, their and the support of the family. They get sadder at night and in the afternoon, when the staff is reduced, there is more silence and they feel lonely. Only a small percentage of them have the consistent information about the disease and treatment, however, the hospital is mainly identified as a good place for the possibility of cure, good assistance and food. Witnessing the suffering and the dying risk of the neighbour, be discharged, exams and treatment procedures suspended on cancelled, bling communicated of the necessity of bling operated on that the disease doesn't have a cure, were the anxieting factors that were remanked not only in the immediate sections, but also in the late ones of the anxieting situations, prevail passive attitudes such as sadness, crying, depression and negativism. We concluded that the psychic and emotional conditions of the patients in the hospital have to be taken on consideration on hospitals emphasizing a comsiete approach, with special care of the speed of the actions and the consistence of the information given to the patient about their health and treatment."
