        "In the pandemic period due to the strong restrictions made necessary to deal with the spread of the Sars COVID-19 Virus, adolescents were the subjects who, most of all, suffered from isolation and lack of sociality, due to social distancing. It was necessary to change their habits, their lifestyles, the way they live social relationships and relate to others. Furthermore, those of them who were facing health difficulties at the time were faced with the impossibility of the services to guarantee safety conditions, so that in most cases many medical, psychiatric and psychological activities were suspended, with hospitalizations postponed to a date to be defined, appointments canceled with a high risk of losing contact with the patient. Many authors agreed, right from the start, that the pandemic consequences would have focused above all on psychological problems. The scientific literature on past pandemics had shown the role of fear, anxiety, stress and depression and its negative psychosocial consequences on the quality of life of the population. Samantha Brooks and colleagues from King's College London reviewed 24 studies on the psychological impact of quarantine and highlighted negative psychological effects including symptoms of post-traumatic stress, confusion and anger. Today there are many contributions in the literature which unfortunately confirm what has been hypothesized."
