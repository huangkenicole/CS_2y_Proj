        "The authors examine associations of three sources of women's aging anxiety--declining attractiveness, health, and fertility--with social contexts of their lives, including locations in systems of inequality, connections to institutions, relationships, and health. They also explore links between aging anxieties and distress.",
        "Employing data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States conducted in 1995-1996, the authors use logistic and OLS regression.",
        "Anxiety about attractiveness is higher among women who are younger, White, heterosexual, employed, separated/divorced, less financially independent, and have worse relationships. Anxiety about health is greater among women who are younger, White, less financially independent, and have worse relationships and health. Anxiety about fertility is higher among younger, more educated, heterosexual, more financially independent, and childless women. Anxiety about health and attractiveness predicts greater distress.",
        "This study suggests that correlates and mental health consequences of aging anxiety differ across sources of concern."
