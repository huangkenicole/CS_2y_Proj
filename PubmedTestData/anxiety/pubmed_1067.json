        "Current evidence has established an association between anxiety and attentional threat biases. Emerging research suggests these attentional biases may play a causal role in anxiety development. Clinical researchers have begun to develop treatments specifically designed to address these attentional processes. As such, Attention training (ATT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety in adults. The current study represents an early attempt to implement ATT to treat social anxiety disorder (SOC) in children. Two boys meeting criteria for DSM-IV SOC participated in the study, along with their parents. Both boys received 10, 10-min sessions of ATT. A multiple-baseline design was used. Following treatment, both boys evidenced reductions in social anxiety. The current study provides preliminary evidence regarding the utility of ATT for treatment of childhood SOC. Future research is needed to further examine the use of this treatment strategy with youth and to explore the mechanisms of change."
