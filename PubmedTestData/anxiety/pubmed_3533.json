        "Perinatal depression can result in short- and long-term adverse effects for women and their children if untreated. Psychological interventions, the preferred treatment for most women with perinatal depression, can also be provided online.",
        "This study aimed to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of Internet-based psychological interventions and to evaluate their effectiveness in the treatment of perinatal depression.",
        "Systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "A systematic literature search was conducted of six databases, including CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO. Depression and anxiety, which were the primary and secondary results of this search, were presented as standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This review was conducted according to the PRISMA checklist.",
        "Thirteen studies involving 2158 perinatal women were included. Content, method, duration and frequency of Internet-based psychological interventions were varied. Participants indicated a high rate of satisfaction with these interventions; participants' dropout rates ranged from 2.6% to 60.8%. Meta-analysis demonstrated that Internet-based psychological interventions improved perinatal depression (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.72, CI\u00a0=\u00a0[-1.02, -0.42], p\u00a0<\u2009.01) and anxiety symptoms (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.52, CI\u00a0=\u00a0[-0.73, -0.30], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), with heterogeneity of 86% and 59%, respectively.",
        "Internet-based psychological interventions are considered as convenient and effective alternative treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. In the future, additional studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of these interventions on the mental health of perinatal women and the effects on the growth and development of infants while controlling for the dropout rate.",
        "Internet-based psychological interventions are innovative approaches to improving perinatal depressive symptoms that can leverage mental health resources and improve accessibility while promoting multidisciplinary integration. The approach, content, frequency and duration of intervention should be considered comprehensively to achieve the objectives of the intervention while maintaining compliance of women with perinatal depression."
