        "Children on the autism spectrum experience high rates of anxiety but little is known about the impact of anxiety on child or parent quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anxiety, autism characteristics, and QoL in children and their parents. Sixty-four parents of children on the spectrum completed questionnaires on their child's autism characteristics, anxiety symptomatology, and both child (PedsQL) and parent QoL (WHOQoL-BREF). Parents of children with elevated anxiety reported lower child and parent QoL. Regression models highlight specific anxiety subscales as predictive of PedsQL school and emotional functioning but not of parent QoL. Anxiety symptomatology may be a significant factor contributing to specific aspects of QoL for children on the spectrum."
