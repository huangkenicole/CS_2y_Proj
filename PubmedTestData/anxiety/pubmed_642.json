      "AbstractText": [
        "Investigations were undertaken on veterans of the Gulf conflict of 1990/91 at the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP), to determine whether routine investigations should be carried out on these veterans. Blood investigations were analysed of a 10% random sample of veterans and also of two veteran groups--one group was well (asymptomatic) and the other unwell (post-traumatic stress disorder). Neurological investigations were carried out as well as 1,000 ultrasound studies and 3,000 ECGs. Almost all blood tests proved normal. The only significant differences found between the two groups were for the alanine/aspartate transaminase and gamma glutamyl transaminase values, where there were more abnormal findings in the unwell group. Abnormal, but expected, neurological investigations were found in those referred for these tests. Ultrasound abnormalities were related to known established clinical diagnoses, apart from three cases. ECG abnormalities were only present in those with known clinical diagnoses. It was concluded that reducing the number of investigations would not only be cost effective but should help to lessen veterans' anxieties."
