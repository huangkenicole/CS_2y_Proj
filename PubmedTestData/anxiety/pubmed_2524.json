        "The similarities and distinctions between the constructs of worry and anxiety were examined in a sample of 189 university students. Three worry scales and four measures of anxiety were compared in relation to measures of negative affect, personal control, and problem-solving style. Although measures of worry and anxiety were highly correlated, negative affect (e.g. depression, confusion) tended to be more closely related to anxiety than to worry, whereas problem-solving style tended to be more closely related to worry than to anxiety. Personal control did not show a differential relationship to anxiety or worry. When the definition of anxiety was restricted to somatic anxiety, however, negative affect, perceived problem-solving abilities, and personal control were more strongly related to worry than to anxiety. Implications of these results are discussed in light of current definitions and measurement of these constructs."
