        "As many as 50% of patients with a primary anxiety disorder may meet criteria for an additional anxiety disorder. However, there is insufficient research on the cooccurrence of the anxiety disorders, although investigations of this nature may facilitate our understanding of their cause, phenomenology, and treatment. The present study examined the occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among patients with social phobia (SP) compared with SP patients without GAD. Of 122 treatment-seeking patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for SP, 29 (23.8%) also met criteria for an additional diagnosis of GAD. SP patients with comorbid GAD demonstrated greater severity on measures of social anxiety and avoidance, general anxiety, cognitive (but not somatic) symptoms of anxiety, depressed mood, functional impairment, and overall psychopathology. Group differences remained significant when comorbidity with other anxiety and mood disorders was controlled. The content of worry among the SP patients with GAD was not specific to social concerns and appeared similar to the reported content of worry in samples of patients with primary GAD. Nevertheless, SP patients with and without GAD responded similarly to cognitive-behavioral group therapy for social phobia. Implications for the understanding and treatment of comorbid SP and GAD are discussed."
