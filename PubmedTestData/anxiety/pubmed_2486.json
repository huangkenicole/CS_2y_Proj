        "This quasi-experimental study used a convenience sample of nursing students (n = 49) to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on anxiety. Students participated in mindfulness meditation sessions and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A statistically significant reduction in trait anxiety was found in the intervention group (p = .000); state anxiety decreased but not significantly. In contrast, anxiety increased significantly in the comparison group, but progression was not significantly different between groups. Trait anxiety may decrease with mindfulness meditation."
