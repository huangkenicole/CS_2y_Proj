        "To determine the views and current practice preferences of interventional radiologists and allied healthcare providers regarding management of preprocedural anxiety.",
        "From March to April 2018, members of the Society of Interventional Radiology were surveyed regarding their opinions in the assessment and management of patient anxiety. Degree of responsibility for the management of anxiety was also queried through the use of a scale (1\u00a0= no responsibility; 2\u00a0= some responsibility; 3\u00a0= major responsibility).",
        "Of 1163 respondents (23.8% response rate), most described preprocedural anxiety as somewhat to very important in their practice (n\u00a0= 961, 82.6%), somewhat to very important to the patients (n\u00a0= 1087, 93.5%), and at least sometimes interfering with delivery of care (n\u00a0= 815, 70.1%). Most respondents did not measure preprocedural anxiety directly (n\u00a0= 953, 81.9%), but would address it if raised by the patient (n\u00a0= 911, 82.9%). Patient education (n\u00a0= 921, 79.1%), medications (n\u00a0= 801, 68.8%), and therapeutic or empathetic interactions (n\u00a0= 665, 56.4%) were most preferred to manage anxiety. Radiologists, nurses, patients, primary care providers, family members, and psychologists or psychiatrists were all allocated responsibility to reduce anxiety.",
        "Interventional radiologists and other providers are aware of the importance of preprocedural anxiety. Despite the notion that most radiologists did not address anxiety directly, most indicated a willingness to discuss the issue if raised by patients. Patient education, medications, and several other techniques are preferred to manage preprocedural anxiety. Responsibility to reduce anxiety is perceived to be shared among radiologists, nurses, patients, family members, and other health care providers."
