      "AbstractText": [
        "To achieve better academic performance, students should improve their cognitive faculties and overcome anxiety. Therefore, the present research was conducted to assess the effect of yoga on the cognitive functions of female adolescents with low academic performance.",
        "The present study is a randomized control trial (RCT). Eighty-nine female students in the age range of 12-14 years were randomly assigned into two groups [yoga (n\u00a0=\u00a045); physical exercise (n\u00a0=\u00a044)] at a school setting. Both groups were assessed before and after on Raven's standard progressive matrices (RSPM), Corsi Block Tapping Test (CBTT), Six Letter Cancellation Test (SLCT), Digit Letter Substitution Test (DLST), Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC).",
        "Findings of the present study showed significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) differences in scores of forward CBTT, SWCT, and SLCT in group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction. Both the groups showed significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) improvement in SLCT, backward scores of CBTT, and STAIC-T. All outcomes measured were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) improved in the yoga group except STAIC-S.",
        "Yoga improves general intelligence, visuospatial working memory, and attention, as well as reduces the anxiety of students with low academic performance. Similarly, physical exercise was also found to be improving visuospatial working memory, sustained attention, and reduce trait anxiety. However, the finding of the present study indicated yoga to be more effective compared to physical exercise in regards to students' fluid intelligence and executive function. Improvement in general intelligence, visuospatial working memory, and attention is expected to positively influence students' academic performance."
