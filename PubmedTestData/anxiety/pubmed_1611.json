        "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of 'peer-assisted video-based education programme' (VTPA) and counselling to reduce anxiety in children newly diagnosed with cancer.",
        "A non-randomised controlled trial design with repeated measures was conducted. The sample of the study consisted of 50 children between the ages of 9 and 18 who were newly diagnosed with cancer in the hospital. Intervention and control groups were created. Children in the intervention group received both VTPA training and counselling practice 3\u00a0days a week for 2\u00a0months. Data were collected with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. The basal assessment in the research was the first meeting with the child, with interval assessments 1\u00a0month after, 2\u00a0months after and 3\u00a0months after the education.",
        "In the study, it was determined that the state anxiety mean scores of the children in the PAVEP and control groups differed over time (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, it was determined that there was no difference between the trait anxiety mean scores of the children (p\u2009>\u20090.05).",
        "VTPA with peer assistance and counselling application supported the reduction of state anxiety in children newly diagnosed with cancer over time."
