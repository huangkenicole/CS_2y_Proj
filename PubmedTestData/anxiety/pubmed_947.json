        "To evaluate the effectiveness of a discourse-based psychological intervention on perioperative anxiety, pain and life satisfaction of patients with AIS.",
        "Between April 2018 and February 2021, 116 consecutive patients with AIS undergoing corrective surgery were enrolled in this study, including 51 with personalized psychological intervention (intervention group, IG) and 65 without (control group, CG). After propensity score matching (PSM), patient characteristics, perioperative scores of anxiety and life satisfaction, measured by values of Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7) and Life Satisfaction Index Z scale (LSIZ), were recorded. Mixed linear models were used to estimate the influence of intervention group and time of measurement, as well as their interactions, in anxiety and life satisfaction. Data on post-surgical pain in both groups was also collected and analyzed.",
        "After PSM, a total of 90 patients (IG, n\u2009=\u200945; CG, n\u2009=\u200945) were enrolled in this study, and the 2 groups were comparable in patients' demographic and baseline characteristics. There were no pre-intervention between-group differences in the degree of anxiety (IG: 3.98\u2009\u00b1\u20093.27 vs. CG: 3.93\u2009\u00b1\u20093.20, p\u2009=\u2009.948, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.015), and life satisfaction (IG: 6.56\u2009\u00b1\u20091.70 vs. CG: 6.67\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09, p\u2009=\u2009.783, Cohen's d = -0.058). After surgery, participants in both IG and CG showed improved the levels of anxiety (GAD-7: IG 2.18\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21; CG 2.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00) and life satisfaction (LSIZ: IG 9.84\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09; CG 9.02\u2009\u00b1\u20092.15). A stratified analysis of patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed improved anxiety (GAD-7: IG 3.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.22 vs. CG 6.80\u2009\u00b1\u20092.05, p\u2009=\u2009.017, Cohen's d = -1.956) and lower pain level (VAS: IG 4.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76 vs. CG 7.00\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00, p\u2009=\u2009.017, Cohen's d = -1.747) in the IG than the CG after surgery.",
