      "AbstractText": [
        "Anxiety is common in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Anxiety has also been identified as a risk factor for cognitive decline. Brief interventions targeting risk mechanisms of anxiety, such as anxiety sensitivity (AS), have been effective in reducing overall anxiety in a variety of populations. This case series investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a brief AS intervention in anxious older adults with MCI (n\u2009=\u20099). Paired samples t-test results indicate that this intervention is capable of significantly reducing AS as measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (\u0394\u2009=\u20095.11, Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.82, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Given these large AS reductions and high acceptability, further investigation of this intervention is warranted in older adults with MCI."
