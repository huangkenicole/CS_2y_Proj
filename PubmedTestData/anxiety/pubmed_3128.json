        "This paper examines the use of the term \"primary femininity\" in current psychoanalytic thinking. The concept of primary femininity arose in reaction to early theories about female sexuality and development; based on a model of male development, these presented problems when applied to females. The author attempts to demonstrate the clinical advances that have resulted from the idea of primary femininity. At the same time she argues that the idea has been used to carry widely differing meanings, and has reflected many writers' differing frames of reference, which range from gender identity through biological traits, object relations, genital anxieties, and bisexuality. Like the terms it originally was intended to replace or augment, it has come to be used reductionistically or loosely. The author warns against its misuse and argues that primary femininity is not a unitary concept, but rather encompasses a related group of ideas about the female body and mind."
