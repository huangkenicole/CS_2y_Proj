        "There is frequently a presumption that Latino parents have a greater preference for involvement in their child's treatment for anxiety compared to non-Latino white parents. However, parent involvement may increase burdens associated with treatment and research suggests that\u00a0Latino individuals already face significantly greater barriers to obtaining mental health treatment. In the current study, we compared Latino and non-Latino parents' preferences for parental involvement and perceptions of burdens in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth anxiety. 117 parents (57 Latino) completed measures to assess child anxiety, perceptions of treatment involvement, and burdens associated with treatment. There were no significant differences between Latino and non-Latino parents except for a trend toward Latino parents reporting more concerns about the feasibility of obtaining CBT for their child's anxiety. Because Latino parents expressed concern about potential treatment barriers, cultural adaptations for treatment should focus on decreasing burdens associated with treatment rather than increasing parental involvement."
