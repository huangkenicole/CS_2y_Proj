On the 1st, 14th, and 30th day after the gastroscopy, the Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire for Ambulatory Surgery (PHBQ-AS) was used to assess NPOBCs in children.",
        "A total of 1,670 children were included in this prospective observational cohort study. The incidence rates of NPOBCs were 14.13%, 4.55%, and 2.14% on the 1st, 14th, and 30th day after gastroscopy, respectively. The risk factors for the first day were female sex (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00-1.79), parental anxiety (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.75-3.12), and severe anxiety in children (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.96-4.07). The risk factors on the 14th day were parental anxiety (OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.19-6.29), a parental educational level above high school (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.00-2.70), and severe anxiety in children (OR 11.87, 95% CI 5.85-24.07). The risk factors on the 30th day were female sex (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.41-6.34), being an only child (OR 4.42, 95% CI 2.18-8.95), a parental educational level above high school (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.27 NPOBCs 5.56), and severe anxiety in children (OR 6.84, 95% CI 2.84-16.49).",
        "In children undergoing painless gastroscopy, the incidence rates of NPOBCs on the 1st, 14th, and 30th day were 14.13%, 4.55%, and 2.14%, respectively. The risk factors for NPOBCs were severe anxiety in children, female sex, parental anxiety, and a parental educational level above high school. In particular, severe preoperative anxiety in children was a persistent risk factor for NPOBCs within 30 days."
