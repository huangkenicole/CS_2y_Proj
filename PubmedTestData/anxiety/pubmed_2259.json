        "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions with an unpredictable course and a remitting-relapsing evolution. Fatigue is a frequent complaint in patients with IBD, affecting approximately half of the newly diagnosed patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to analyze fatigue in patients with IBD in remission. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> One hundred nineteen consecutive outpatients diagnosed with IBD for over 3 months that were in corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission at the time of assessment were included in this cross-sectional study. Out of them, 72 (60.5%) were male; the median age was 39 years (IQR 30-47). Seventy-seven patients (64.7%) were diagnosed with Crohn's disease and forty-two (35.3%) with ulcerative colitis, with a median disease duration of 6 years (IQR 2-10). Fatigue, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), anxiety and depression were evaluated using the following self-administered questionnaires: FACIT Fatigue, IBDQ 32 and HADS. <i>Results:</i> The mean FACIT-Fatigue score was 41.6 (SD \u00b1 8.62), and 38.7% of patients were revealed as experiencing fatigue when a cut-off value of 40 points was used. The mean IBDQ 32 score was 189.4 (SD \u00b1 24.1). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were detected in 37% and 21% of the patients, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, fatigue was significantly associated with lower HR-QoL (OR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.42-3.44, <i>p</i> < 0.001), symptoms of anxiety (OR 5.04, 95% CI: 1.20-21.22, <i>p</i> = 0.008), female sex (OR 3.32, 95% CI: 1.02-10.76, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and longer disease duration (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01-1.27, <i>p</i> = 0.04). <i>Conclusions:</i> Fatigue is highly prevalent even in patients with inactive IBD and is correlated with lower HR-QoL and anxiety, as well as with clinical factors such as longer disease duration and female sex."
