        "Peritraumatic distress is a\u00a0syndrome that involves negative emotions, such as anxiety, helplessness and horror, experienced during and shortly after a\u00a0traumatic event. The intensity of peritraumatic distress is significantly linked to the intensity of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) symptoms. The aim of the study was to study the intensity of peritraumatic distress symptoms in the mothers of severely ill children and the relationship between peritraumatic distress and psychological, socio-demographic and medical coefficients in the mothers.",
        "An anonymous survey was performed in a\u00a0group of 135 mothers of children with a\u00a0perinatal medical history and mothers of children hospitalized in an intensive care unit and an oncology unit. The demographic questionnaire was compiled by the authors along with several standardized research tools.",
        "Intensity of peritraumatic distress correlates strongly positively with anxiety, \u03c1 = 0.50; P < 0.001, and moderately positively with intrusion \u03c1 = 0.39; P < 0.00, arousal, \u03c1 = 0.38; P < 0.001, PTSD intensification, \u03c1 = 0.40; P < 0.001, depression, \u03c1 = 0.49; P < 0.001. Significant predictors of peritraumatic distress include the use of such coping strategies as acceptance, \u03b2 = -0.44; P = 0.001, denial, \u03b2 = 0.20; P = 0.019, planning, \u03b2 = -0.26; P = 0.012 and humour, \u03b2 = -0.29; P = 0.048, as well as the possibility to obtain self-worth support, \u03b2 = -0.07; P = 0.029 (R2 corrected = 0,32; F(5.33) = 9.43; P < 0.001).",
        "Coping strategies are a\u00a0potentially modifiable factor, thus, implementing prevention programmes concerning the strategies should be considered."
