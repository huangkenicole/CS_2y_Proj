        "This study aimed to assess the effect of lavender aromatherapy on anxiety and comfort after cesarean birth.",
        "Randomized control trial.",
        "Forty-eight patients who had a cesarean birth were asked to complete the six-item State and Trait Anxiety (STAI-6) score to assess their level of anxiety pre- and postapplication of either lavender aromatherapy or placebo during their inpatient postpartum stay. Their comfort and pain levels pre- and postadministration were assessed, and differences between groups were analyzed. Results: There was no difference in postintervention STAI-6 scores between the aromatherapy and placebo groups (p = .56). Women who received the lavender aromatab\u00ae had significantly (p = .037) higher self-reported levels of comfort (M 2.6 SD .82) when compared with those who received placebo (M 2.0 SD 1.0).",
        "Many women use aromatherapy at home to promote comfort and relaxation. Women feel lavender aromatherapy improves their comfort in the hospital setting after cesarean birth. Clinicians should consider ways to safely use aromatherapy as one option to promote postoperative cesarean birth care."
