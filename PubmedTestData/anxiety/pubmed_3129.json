        "Online environments have become the main sources of health-related information. However, if used incorrectly, this can decrease the level of well-being. Cyberchondria corresponds to the hypochondria in the digital age. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cyberchondria and trait anxiety, psychological well-being, and other factors in women of reproductive age. This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design. Face-to-face questionnaires were administered to women aged 18 to 49. The sample size was formed and stratified according to the population of the 47 family health centers to reflect the entire population. The questionnaire included a sociodemographic information form, the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS). This study included 422 participants. The average daily use of the Internet was 2.14 \u00b1 1.837 hours, while that of social media was 2.69 \u00b1 2.027 hours. The mean CSS score was 89.42 \u00b1 21.688; the mean trait anxiety score was 44.34 \u00b1 8.791, and the mean PWBS score was 324.26 \u00b1 35.944. Factors that interacted with the level of cyberchondria were the trait anxiety score, PWBS score, alcohol consumption, and average daily use of the internet and social media. Increased online time, alcohol consumption, trait anxiety levels, and psychological well-being increase cyberchondria levels. Improvements must be made in the accuracy of online information, which is unsupervised and easily accessible to society as a source of information. Future studies should focus on the prevention, detection, and treatment of cyberchondriasis. Identifying and improving the factors affecting women's and mothers' cyberchondria will also increase the chances of providing primary protection against certain diseases."
