        "Administered the Alpert-Haber Achievement Anxiety Test (AAT) to 54 students who expressed interest in participating in a test anxiety desensitization workshop. In addition, 182 students from the general college population were tested. Results indicated that both the debilitating and facilitating (AAT) scales were higher for the self-referred volunteer group. These data indicate that these scales are useful in distinguishing self-referred volunteers for behavior modification workshops from a general college population. In addition, the scales of the AAT were correlated with the number of sessions attended by those students who enrolled in the desensitization groups. Results indicated no relationship between attrition and debilitating anxiety. There was a correlation of r = .318 p less than .15 between facilitating anxiety scores and number of sessions attended. It is suggested that facilitating anxiety can function as a measure of S's ego strength in predicting workshop attendance."
