        "Reminiscence therapy (RT) is frequently used with elderly patients to improve their psychological status, but a few studies have examined its application in lung cancer patients. This study explored whether a reminiscence therapy-involved care program (RTICP) could improve cognitive functions, anxiety, depression, patient satisfaction, and survival in elderly lung cancer patients.",
        "This randomized, controlled study enrolled 138 elderly post-operative lung cancer patients into two groups, an RTICP group (n = 69) and a usual care program (UCP) group (n = 69), for a 12-month intervention period and a follow-up period. During the 12-month intervention, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D), patient satisfaction, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.",
        "MMSE and patient satisfaction were elevated in the RTICP group compared to the UCP group at month (M) 12. Additionally, RTICP reduced HADS-A at M6, M9, and M12 and the anxiety rate at M9, HADS-D at M9, and M12 compared to UCP, whereas the depression rate was no different between the two groups at any time (all P > 0.050). Moreover, DFS and OS were no different between the two groups (all P > 0.050).",
        "RTICP, considered as an optional psychological intervention, enhances cognitive functions, alleviates anxiety and depression feelings, and elevates satisfaction among elderly lung cancer patients."
