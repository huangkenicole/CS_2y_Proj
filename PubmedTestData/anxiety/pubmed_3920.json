        "This study evaluated the effect of music intervention on the anxiety and stress responses of patients who underwent an interventional cardiac catheterisation.",
        "The study design was a pre- and post-test randomised controlled trial that included 94 patients who underwent a transcatheter atrial septal defect closure. Patients were allocated to receive either music intervention (n = 47) or usual care (n = 47) during the interventional cardiac catheterisation. Music intervention effectiveness was examined in terms of anxiety, salivary cortisol level, and heart rate variability.",
        "The average age of participants was 45.40 years (\u00b116.04) in the experimental group and 47.26 years (\u00b113.83) in the control group. Two-thirds (66.0%) of the participants in each group were women. State anxiety (F = 31.42, p < 0.001), anxiety-numerical rating scale (F = 20.08, p < 0.001), salivary cortisol levels (F = 4.98, p = 0.021), and low-frequency component/high-frequency component ratio (F = 17.31, p < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly reduced compared with those in the control group at the end of the music intervention.",
        "This study provides practical evidence of a reduction in anxiety and stress response from music intervention preceding an interventional cardiac catheterisation, indicating that this intervention should be considered in clinical management."
