        "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are complex psychiatric conditions that commonly co-occur. No evidence-based, \"gold standard\" treatments for PTSD/SUD comorbidity are currently available. Thus, it is imperative to better understand cognitive-affective mechanisms, targetable via cognitive-behavioral intervention (i.e., malleable), that may be related to both disorders in order to improve the theory and treatment of PTSD/SUD. Anxiety sensitivity is a malleable cognitive-affective factor with relevance to both PTSD and SUD. This systematic review focused on the published literature on anxiety sensitivity and trauma/PTSD and substance use/SUD from 1966 - May 1, 2018, and includes a total of 35 manuscripts. The state of the literature, limitations, and future research directions are discussed."
