        "This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of facilitating four sessions of art therapy intervention with a primary focus on implementation and acceptability. The exploratory aim was on assessing the effect of art therapy on self-reported outcomes on anxiety and mood among five individuals (aged 18+ years) hospitalized for burn injuries and to understand their perceptions of engagement with art therapy. A convergent mixed-methods small N design was adopted wherein both quantitative and qualitative data are gathered and then integrated, and an individual served as his/her own control when assessed before and after art therapy. Anxiety was assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety short-form of the emotional distress bank, and mood was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). There was a statistically significant decrease in anxiety scores and negative mood scale. Positive mood scale scores tended to improve after art therapy though were not statistically significant. Thematic analysis of qualitative data indicates that art therapy improves 1) symptom management, 2) facilitates emotional expression and 3) insight, 4) brings out symbolic and metaphorical representations, and 5) allows tactile and sensory exploration of art media. This study demonstrated that art therapy can be successfully implemented with acute burn patients and can have promising psychosocial benefits. Further research in needed to determine the effectiveness of art therapy with more burn patients, in ways that is meaningful to the patients."
