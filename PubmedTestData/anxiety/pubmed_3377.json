        "High social anxiety is associated with increased attentional bias, and difficulties disengaging from relevant threat information, though social anxiety may also be associated with avoidance of threat. Few mechanisms of this relationship have been empirically evaluated, whereas theories and treatment manuals implicate avoidance and/or safety behaviors as significant agents of negative reinforcement for anxiety symptoms and search for threat. The current study sought to investigate one safety behavior, excessive reassurance seeking, as a mediator of the relationship between social anxiety and attention bias to disgust facial stimuli. Support was found for our hypotheses, such that social anxiety symptoms had an indirect effect on attention bias to disgust faces through increased reassurance seeking. These results suggest that reassurance seeking may result in disengagement of attention to threat stimuli. Specifically, social anxiety may result in a decreased threshold for negative social cues and therefore seek out reassurance feedback and avoid threatening stimuli. Future studies should test these directly and utilize a prospective design. The current study suggests that reassurance seeking may be involved in the attention bias process, providing additional data for current cognitive theories of social anxiety and additional support for reinforcement patterns of anxiety symptoms."
