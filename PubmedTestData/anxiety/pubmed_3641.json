        "Preoperative anxiety is not systematically assessed during premedication appointments, although it may influence the postoperative course and outcome.",
        "The aim of this study was to assess preoperative anxiety in a sample of patients before major urological surgery and to characterize the impact on postoperative pain. An additional aim was to analyze the agreement between patients' self-ratings and physicians' anxiety ratings.",
        "In all, 127 male and 27 female patients participated in a prospective observational study. Preoperative anxiety was assessed with two validated instruments - the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale) and the State Scale of the STOA questionnaire (State-Trait Operation Anxiety) - during the premedication appointment. Physicians provided their subjective ratings on patients' anxiety and need for information using the APAIS. The predictive value of preoperative anxiety for postoperative pain was evaluated.",
        "Nearly four out of ten patients were identified as \"anxiety cases\"; thereof women were more afraid than men were. Preoperative anxiety was not correctly assessed by physicians, who overestimated patients' anxiety. In female patients, preoperative anxiety was predictive of increased postoperative pain scores.",
        "Preoperative anxiety is a frequent concern and often not correctly assessed by physicians. The use of scoring systems to detect preoperative anxiety is useful in clinical routine and helps to decide on therapeutic interventions."
