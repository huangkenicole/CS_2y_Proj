        "Relevant literature was searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Medline from database establishment to October 2022 by a computer. Next, a screening was performed on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the effect of non-drug interventions on anxiety and depression in HF patients, followed by a collection of the related data. This meta-analysis was conducted based on Bayesian network, and the statistical analysis was conducted using R4.2 software.",
        "A total of 23 papers were enrolled into this study. The results of Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group and the structured video conferencing support (SVCS) group, telephone case management (TCM) could effectively reduce the anxiety and depression of HF patients. The ranking results revealed that TCM may be the most effective intervention to lower the risk of depression in HF patients, followed by Tai Chi Chuan and Chi Kung training (TCC) and structured telephone support (STS).",
        "TCM is the most effective intervention to prevent HF patients from anxiety and depression."
