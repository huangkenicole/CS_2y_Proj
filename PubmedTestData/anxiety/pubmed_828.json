        "The method of direct co-frequency rating was explored for the study of relationships among individuals' self-reported anxiety reactions. The subjects were 40 adolescents who gave co-frequency ratings (how often the reactions co-occurred) for all pairs of 10 preselected reactions to anxiety. The mean co-frequency matrix was subjected to multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. The same subjects also rated the intensity of the same reactions in an anxiety inventory of the \"S-R\" type. The correlations among reactions were computed and compared with corresponding co-frequency estimates. The relationship between these two types of data was relatively high. Factor analysis of the correlations gave a \"Psychic\" and a \"Somatic\" reaction factor, whereas the main dimension obtained from co-frequency ratings reflected a general reaction factor. This outcome was supported by the cluster analyses, which yielded two and one clusters, respectively, interpretable in accordance with the dimension analyses."
