        "To investigate the effect of a written prayer technique on the anxiety of mothers of children with cancer.",
        "This clinical trial recruited 90 mothers of children with cancer admitted to the Medical Centre of Tehran. Using a convenience sampling method, we randomly assigned the participants to two groups: control (n = 45) and intervention (n = 45). Data were collected through the Spielberger's anxiety scale and a demographic questionnaire. Maternal anxiety was measured before the intervention, immediately after the three-day intervention, and five weeks after the intervention. We used a writing technique in the intervention and control groups for 20 minutes over three consecutive days. In the intervention group, participants wrote down their sincere desires and wishes that they demanded from God without any worry or stress. The control group spent 20 minutes writing their normal daily schedules; for example, feeding their children or changing their children's clothes. During the three consecutive days of intervention, we asked both groups not to worry about grammar or spelling errors. Finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods.ResultA statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (intervention and control mean, 34.9 \u00b1 9.9 and 47.9 \u00b1 16.2, respectively) relative to anxiety after the intervention (p &lt; 0.001). After five weeks, the intervention group continued to exhibit significantly reduced anxiety compared with the control group (intervention and control mean, 34.7 \u00b1 9.6 and 48.5 \u00b1 16.4; p &lt; 0.001).Significance of resultsThe written prayer technique appears to be an effective, efficient, cost-effective, and practical method for reducing anxiety in mothers of children with cancer."
