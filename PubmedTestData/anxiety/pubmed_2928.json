        "The present study examined specific aspects of individuals' personal strivings as mediators, and religious tradition as a moderator, of the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and mental health. In a sample of 268 university students, the negative relationship between intrinsic religiousness and hostility was mediated by the degree of sanctification within individuals' strivings. The relationships between intrinsic religiousness and both anxiety and depression were moderated by religious tradition, with Catholics' intrinsic religiousness significantly associated with greater anxiety and depression but Protestants' intrinsic religiousness not significantly associated with either of these mental health variables. Implications of these results for future research on religiousness are discussed."
