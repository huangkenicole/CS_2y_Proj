        "Although there has been great diagnostic activity within the conditions formally included under the general rubric of neurosis in the last 20 years, there is little evidence that the many new diagnoses (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and dysthymic disorder) have helped clinicians and improved the health of those diagnosed. This is largely because of the extensive comorbidity between these disorders negates much of their attempted separation and it is argued that the core of neurosis is a mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, or cothymia, combined with significant personality disorder of any type. The specific association of the anxious-fearful personality cluster (cluster C) and neurosis, called the general neurotic syndrome, is also relevant but appears to have lesser significance as the personality elements are not stable. Data are presented that justify these conclusions from a long-term follow-up study of anxiety and depressive disorders."
