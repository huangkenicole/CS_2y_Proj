        "Cancer patients were particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic given their reliance on the healthcare system, and their weakened immune systems. This systematic review examines the social, psychological, and economic impacts of COVID-19 on cancer patients.",
        "The systematic search, conducted in March 2021, captures the experience of COVID-19 Wave I, when the most severe restrictions were in place globally, from a patient perspective.",
        "The search yielded 56 studies reporting on the economic, social, and psychological impacts of COVID-19. The economic burden associated with cancer for patients during the pandemic included direct and indirect costs with both objective (i.e. financial burden) and subjective elements (financial distress). The pandemic exasperated existing psychological strain and associated adverse outcomes including worry and fear (of COVID-19 and cancer prognosis); distress, anxiety, and depression; social isolation and loneliness. National and institutional public health guidelines to reduce COVID-19 transmission resulted in suspended cancer screening programmes, delayed diagnoses, postponed or deferred treatments, and altered treatment. These altered patients' decision making and health-seeking behaviours.",
        "COVID-19 compounded the economic, social, and psychological impacts of cancer on patients owing to health system adjustments and reduction in economic activity. Identification of the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients from a psychological, social, and economic perspective following the pandemic can inform the design of timely and appropriate interventions and supports, to deal with the backlog in cancer care and enhance recovery."
