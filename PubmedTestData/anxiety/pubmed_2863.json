        "Diagnosis and treatment procedures in cancers and resulting anxiety negatively affect the individual and the family. Particularly treatment methods may generate psychological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the level of such symptoms in Turkish gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. A total of 41 patients who were referred to our gynecologic oncology research clinic between January-March 2012, receiving 3 months or more chemotherapy and who agreed to participate were enrolled in study. All the data were collected using a personal information form, Edmonton Symptom Assesment System and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Patients received highest point average from fatigue symptom (6.53\u00b12.67) and lowest point average from dyspnea (1.53\u00b13.03) according to Edmonton Symptom Assesment System. The mean State Anxiety score of patients was 43.1\u00b19.77 and mean Trait Anxiety score was 46.7\u00b17.01. Comparing symptoms of patients and mean State Anxiety score it was found that there was a statistically significant corelation with symptoms like pain (p<0.05), sadness (p<0.001), insomnia (p<0.05), state of well being (p<0.001) and dyspnea (p<0.05). Similarly comparing symptoms of patients and mean Trait Anxiety score demonstrated significant correlations for fatigue (p<0.05), sadness (p<0.01), insomnia (p<0.01) and state of well-being (p<0.01). As a result, patients with gynecological cancers experienced symptoms related to chemotherapy and a moderate level of anxiety. In accordance, appropriate interventions should recommended for the evaluation and improvement of anxiety and symptoms related to treatment in cancer patients."
