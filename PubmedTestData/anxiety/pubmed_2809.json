        "To compare the therapeutic effect between <i>Tiaoshen</i> acupuncture combined with psychotherapy and simple psychotherapy on anxiety after methamphetamine withdrawal.",
        "A total of 78 patients were randomized into an observation group (39 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (39 cases, 1 case dropped off). Psychotherapy was given in the control group. On the basis of the treatment in the control group, <i>Tiaoshen</i> acupuncture was applied at Baihui (GV 20), Shenting (GV 24), Benshen (GB 13), Neiguan (PC 6) and Shenmen (HT 7) in the observation group. The treatment was given once a day, 6 days were as one course and totally 4 courses were required in both groups. The scores of Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), quality of life for drug addicts (QOL<i>-</i>DA) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) before and after treatment were observed in both groups.",
        "After treatment, the various scores and the total scores of HAMA, QOL<i>-</i>DA and PSQI were decreased compared before treatment in both groups (<i>P</i><0.05), and the scores of somatic anxiety factor, the psychic anxiety factor and the total score of HAMA, each various score and the total score of QOL<i>-</i>DA as well as the scores of sleep quality, time to fall asleep, sleep time, daytime dysfunction and the total score of PSQI in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05).",
        "<i>Tiaoshen</i> acupuncture combined with psychotherapy can relieve the anxiety in patients with anxiety after methamphetamine withdrawal, improve the quality of life and sleep, the therapeutic effect is superior to the simple psychotherapy."
