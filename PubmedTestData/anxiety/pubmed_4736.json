        "Anxiety about math can lead to long-term negative consequences related to academic achievement and professional success. However, it remains unclear how elevated math-anxiety modulates brain activity while solving arithmetic problems. In the current study, we recorded electrophysiological responses throughout arithmetic problem solving, both at the period of anticipating an upcoming arithmetic problem and solving an arithmetic problem. Results showed that, after controlling for mathematical performance, people with higher math anxiety tended to show stronger beta band oscillation and P300 amplitude while expecting the arithmetic problems, as well as stronger gamma band activity while solving the arithmetic problems. These results suggest that individuals highly anxious about math might use more attentional resources during the course of anticipating the upcoming arithmetic problems, and showed greater attentional bias toward arithmetic problems during solving arithmetic problems."
