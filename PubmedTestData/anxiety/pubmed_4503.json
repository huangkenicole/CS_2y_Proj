        "Medically-induced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is substantially more prevalent than PTSD in the general population. In people with stroke, it can impact as many as 23% of patients, with negative effects on mental health as well as stroke-related disability. Medically-induced PTSD may have unique features compared to other forms of PTSD, and therefore there is a pressing need to evaluate existing treatments for PTSD in this context. The current study reports on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD subsequent to a pontine stroke. Using a quasi-experimental case design, a 44-year-old Caucasian woman received EMDR delivered via telehealth. Self-report measures were obtained at baseline, pre-EMDR, and post-EMDR, with brief neuropsychological testing pre/post-EMDR. After 3 sessions of EMDR, the patient no longer met criteria for PTSD, and showed clinically significant reductions in depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms. With proper safety provisions, it is feasible to deliver EMDR via telehealth to alleviate post-stroke PTSD. Reduced linguistic demands of EMDR may be particularly appealing for persons with neurological disorders as compared to other trauma therapies. Further work is also needed to understand the parameters of baseline neuropsychological function that could impact response to intervention."
