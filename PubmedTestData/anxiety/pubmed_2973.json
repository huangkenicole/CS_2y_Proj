        "Colon cancer survivors can experience several post-treatment consequences that include fatigue and often report severe psychological illnesses such as depression or anxiety. There is little published quantitative data on the quality of life and psychological well-being associated with the health of Tunisian colon cancer survivors.",
        "A total of 60 recovering colon cancer patients underwent a structured interview, which included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) scale, the Piper fatigue scale and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).",
        "Patients were 59.26\u00a0years old on average. The median length of remission was 33.3\u00a0months. Surgery was performed on all patients, followed by 96.7% adjuvant chemotherapy. 15.1% of study participants were in the severe category for the depression score and 10% were in this category for the anxiety score. Ninety-one percent reported pathological fatigue scores on the Piper scale. However, only 8.33% were experiencing severe fatigue. According to the QLQ-C30 assessment, the overall quality of life was slightly impaired with an overall average score of 79.54\u2009\u00b1\u200916.98. Anxiety, depression and fatigue negatively affect global health outcomes and all their dimensions.",
        "Even in the recovery phase, colon cancer patients can see their quality of life deteriorate. It comes out of their psychological experience and their physical life. It is, therefore, crucial to provide greater attention to these patients for holistic and multi-disciplinary care."
