        "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between symptoms and objective findings and dry eye (DE) patients' personalities and levels of depression and anxiety.",
        "The study group consisted of 67 DE patients who presented to the ophthalmology clinic with symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) and were first diagnosed. Patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including tear-film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer 1 and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). All subjects also completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).",
        "No relationship was found for the Schirmer 1 Test and TBUT with psychological parameters or OSDI scores. When compared with the normal values for the Turkish population, sub-dimensions of temperament in DED; novelty seeking (NS) was significantly lower (P<0.001); harm avoidance (HA) (P=0.014), and persistence (P<0.001) were significantly higher. Significant positive correlation with HA and significant negative correlation with NS were found for the OSDI results. Furthermore, our mediation model revealed that anxiety mediated the effect of NS and HA on OSDI.",
        "The significant association of temperament sub-dimensions with OSDI scores in the DED group may play a role in explaining the inconsistency between symptoms and signs. Professionals who care for DED should consider temperament sub-dimensions when they detect discordance between symptoms and signs."
