        "This study aimed to compare situational and trait anxiety levels in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with that in healthy controls and to investigate their correlation to the perceived health status.",
        "From November 2007 to December 2009 in total 879 patients (405 female, 15-71 years) with various CHD and 40 healthy controls completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess state and trait anxiety, the depression scaling instrument CES-D, and the health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36.",
        "In patients with CHD no increased anxiety as a trait could be found (Mann-Whitney Utest, p = .186). Only situational anxiety in the setting of an outpatient department in a tertiary center was increased compared to healthy controls (Mann-Whitney U test, p = .004). Anxiety was closely related to depression and to all of the nine SF-36 dimensions (r = -.149 to r = -.745, p<.001).",
        "In general, patients with CHD show a rather normal anxiety pattern compared to healthy controls. These symptoms of anxiety were strongly correlated with the perceived health status. Only situational anxiety levels at the hospital are increased and still remain an important challenge for doctors and psychologists."
