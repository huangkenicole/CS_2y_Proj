        "The unique pressures of a surgical career put surgeons at particular risk of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression. Surgeons have previously been shown to have a high prevalence of psychological distress. This study aimed to systematically review the prevalence of anxiety and depression amongst surgeons, and to identify factors that can modify the risk of anxiety and depression in surgeons.",
        "A 10-year systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines to identify citations related to the keywords \"anxiety\" OR \"depression\" AND \"surgeon\" in PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to produce a final list of citations.",
        "Thirty-one citations were included with a total of 11,399 participants. The median percentage of anxiety in surgeons was 20 with a range of 54.6%. While the median percentage of depression was 24 with a range of 59%. Risk factors associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression include female gender, younger age, concurrent burnout, and occupational concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Protective factors include institutional support and a sense of social belonging.",
        "There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression amongst surgeons over the past decade. It is imperative to develop strategies to mitigate the effect of anxiety and depression in surgeons."
