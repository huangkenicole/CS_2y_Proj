        "1. The behavioural effects of classical anxiolytics such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines have been well characterised. However, recent research has been aimed at the development of novel anxiolytics without problems of sedation, muscle relaxation, amnesia and dependence. 2. A number of novel omega (benzodiazepine) receptor ligands with anxiolytic properties have been described including alpidem, bretazenil, suriclone and abecarnil. Although these compounds share some behavioural effects with older anxiolytic drugs, such as increasing punished drinking, they also show many differences. Their novel profiles may be related to low intrinsic activity or to selectivity for omega receptor subtypes. 3. The possibility that novel anxiolytics may be found among compounds active at serotonin receptors remains a strong hypothesis. Compounds, which, like buspirone, are active at 5HT1A receptors may be anxiolytic as may be antagonists at 5HT2 and 5HT3 receptors. All these compounds have behavioural effects which differ from those of benzodiazepines. 4. In order more effectively to screen for and develop novel anxiolytics it will be necessary to refine behavioural models in the light of feedback from the clinic."
