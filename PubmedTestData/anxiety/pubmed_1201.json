        "In this study, we aimed to find a correlation between anxiety related to dental procedures and migraines. A cross-sectional study was performed on 171 patients who attended specific dental clinics. The patients were randomly categorized into a migraine group (83) and a control group. To determine the anxiety level, all the patients filled out a validated questionnaire (the Arabic version of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale). All responses ranged from \"not anxious\" (scoring 1) to \"extremely anxious\" (scoring 5). Based on the patient responses, the total score was recorded and compared statistically between the two groups. The sound of drilling was one of the most vital factors causing anxiety and headaches in migraine patients. Comparing the presence or absence of headache and usage of analgesics between the two groups, migraine patients complained to have headaches during or after dental treatment more frequently than controls and used analgesics more than non-migraine controls. Migraine patients visiting dental clinics feel more anxious about the working environment and need certain modifications before, during, and after dental procedures."
