        "The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression in older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults.",
        "A modified version of the PHQ-9 (KICA-dep) and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) were administered as part of a wider dementia prevalence study conducted in the Torres Strait. Results were compared to diagnoses obtained on Geriatric review to evaluate their applicability in the region.",
        "A total of 236 participants completed the KICA-dep and 184 completed the GAI short form. Of these, 10.6% were identified with depression and 15.8% with anxiety. Some participants found questions about suicide ideation and self-harm offensive and others had difficulty understanding concepts on the GAI. The KICA-dep performed poorly in comparison to diagnosis on geriatric clinical review, so results are unlikely to reflect the true prevalence of depression in the region.",
        "Further research is required to explore the underlying dimensions of depression and anxiety and terminology used to express mood symptoms in the Torres Strait.",
        "\u2022 Current mental health screening tools are not applicable for the Torres Strait\u2022 More work is required to determine how symptoms of depression and anxiety are expressed within Torres Strait communities."
