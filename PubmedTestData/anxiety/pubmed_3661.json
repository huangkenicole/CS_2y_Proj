        "Anxiety is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms worldwide. Studies show that there is an increase of >25\u00a0% in the prevalence of anxiety with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic process. Due to the various side effects of drugs used in the treatment of anxiety, interest in natural therapeutic alternatives has increased. Agarwood is a plant used as a natural therapeutic due to its sedative effect as well as many effects such as antioxidant and antibacterial. Although there are many studies with agarwood, comprehensive behavioral studies, including the next generation, are limited. In present study, zebrafish fed with diets containing 10-100\u00a0ppm water extract of Agarwood (AWE) for 3 and 8\u00a0weeks were exposed to predator stress using Oscar fish in order to test the potential anxiolytic effect of AWE. At the end of the period, zebrafish exposed to predator stress were subjected to anxiety and circadian tests. Histopathological evaluation and immunofluorescent analyzes of BDNF and 5HT4-R proteins were performed in the brains of zebrafish. The effects on the next generation were examined by taking offspring from zebrafish. According to the results, it was observed that AWE had a healing effect on anxiety-like behaviors and on the disrupted circadian rhythm triggered by the predatory stress it applied, especially in the 8\u00a0weeks 100\u00a0ppm group. Interestingly, it was also found to be effective in offspring of zebrafish fed diets with AWE."
