        "This study explored relationships among perceived interpersonal competence and demographic and work history variables in a randomized control trial for social anxiety disorder (SAD) that compared work-related group cognitive behavioral therapy plus vocational services (WCBT+VSAU) to vocational services only (VSAU-alone). Intervention effects of perceived interpersonal competence on treatment outcomes over 12\u2009weeks were also examined. Data from 250 job seekers with SAD (59.2% Female; 40.8% Black/African American; 82.4% Non-Hispanic/non-Latino/a) were analyzed. We predicted negative relationships between perceived interpersonal competence and symptoms/impairment and that individuals with lower perceived interpersonal competence would benefit more quickly in WCBT+VSAU relative to VSAU-alone. Results indicated that perceived interpersonal competence did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, homeless status, or employment history. There were no intervention effects of perceived interpersonal competence regarding social anxiety or overall functional impairment, but results supported negative relationships between perceived interpersonal competence and lower social anxiety and overall functional impairment in both conditions. Separately, perceived interpersonal competence moderated effects in the depression model such that there were faster declines in depression at lower perceived interpersonal competence levels in WCBT+VSAU, but not in VSAU-alone. Results indicate the value of attending to perceived interpersonal competence in interventions, which may result in mood benefits."
