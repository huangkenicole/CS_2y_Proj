        "Previous studies in children with innocent murmurs have shown that parental concern is common. Our aim was to assess the level of anxiety among parents of children referred for cardiology evaluation because of an innocent heart murmur and investigate their perceptions about innocent murmurs.",
        "A questionnaire was completed by parents before and after consultation. The questionnaire included a six-item short form of the state scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After the echocardiogram, a detailed consultation was offered including a thorough explanation that the results were normal, as well as a written report.",
        "A total of 417 questionnaires were completed by parents of 340 children. Almost half of the parents believed that a heart murmur signifies heart disease or may interfere with child's ability to exercise; 21% of them stated that the siblings should also be investigated irrespective of the presence of a murmur. The mean Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire score before pediatric cardiology consultation was 17.1 \u00b1 4.3 and increased to 22.6 \u00b1 2.8 after the consultation (Wilcoxon P < 0.001).",
        "Parents of infants and children with innocent murmurs exhibit moderate levels of anxiety and this condition can be ameliorated significantly after pediatric cardiology consultation. Focused parental education is of paramount importance and the role of pediatric cardiologists is crucial and decisive."
