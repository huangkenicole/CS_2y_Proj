      "AbstractText": [
        "Evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve symptoms for ICU surrogates at highest risk of developing psychologic distress: those facing end-of-life care decisions.",
        "MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through April 16, 2022.",
        "Following an a priori protocol, randomized trials of interventions delivered to surrogates of adult ICU patients who died or had high likelihood of mortality evaluating surrogate symptoms were identified.",
        "Two reviewers performed screening and data extraction and assessed risk of bias (Cochrane Risk of Bias [RoB] 2 tool). Trials were eligible for meta-analysis if group mean symptom scores were provided at 3 or 6 months. Pooled effects were estimated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochrane Q, I2 ). Certainty of evidence was assessed (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).",
        "Of 1,660 records, 10 trials met inclusion criteria representing 3,824 surrogates; eight were included in the meta-analysis. Overall RoB was rated Some Concerns. Most ( n = 8) interventions focused on improving communication and enhancing psychologic support in the ICU. All trials measured anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Significant improvement was seen at 3 months (depression, mean difference [MD], -0.68; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.22, moderate certainty; posttraumatic stress, standardized MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.01, very low certainty) and 6 months (anxiety, MD, -0.70; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.22, moderate certainty). Sensitivity analyses suggest significant findings may be unstable. Subgroup analyses demonstrated differences in effect by trial location, interventionist, and intervention dose.",
        "Communication and psychological support interventions in the ICU yielded small but significant improvement in psychological symptoms with moderate to very low certainty evidence in a prognostically-enriched sample of ICU surrogates facing end-of-life care decisions. A new approach to interventions that extend beyond the ICU may be needed."
