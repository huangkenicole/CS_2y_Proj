        "To better understand relations between personality and anxiety in general, and personality differences between compulsive checkers and nonchecking anxious individuals in particular, the current study was conducted. Participants included a nonclinical undergraduate sample of 36 compulsive checkers, 33 nonchecking anxious controls and 33 nonchecking nonanxious controls who were compared on five basic personality dimensions: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect (Goldberg, 1992). Results indicated that a combined group of all anxious individuals was less extraverted and less emotionally stable than nonchecking/nonanxious controls. Results further indicated that compulsive checkers were less emotionally stable and more conscientious than nonchecking anxious controls. The implications of these findings, as well as the impact of the order of personality item presentation, are considered and discussed."
