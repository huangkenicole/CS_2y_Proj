        "Anxiety is prevalent among medical residents and is associated with fatigue, psychological dysfunction, and burnout. A low personal achievement level is a characteristic of burnout, which-if unaddressed-may lead to medical error and decrease the quality of patient care. This study aimed to assess both personal achievement levels and anxiety levels in current oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) residents and to discern a relationship between anxiety severity and perceived personal achievement level among residents.",
        "An anonymous 20-question cross-sectional online survey was developed using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the personal Maslach Burnout Inventory.\u00a0The survey was sent to all the OMS residents enrolled in programs affiliated with the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in 2017. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to obtain summary measures of the predictor (anxiety) and the outcome (personal achievement) stratified by age, gender, marital status, program type (4- or 6-year program), and year of residency. Multinomial logistic regression models were obtained to evaluate the association between anxiety and personal achievement. A 2-sided P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "We received 238 responses (20% response rate); 58% of respondents had moderate or severe levels of anxiety, and nearly half of respondents reported moderate or low levels of personal achievement. Women were more likely to have severe anxiety than men (60% vs 37%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Residents with severe anxiety were 91% more likely to report low levels of personal achievement than residents with low anxiety (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.22; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The results suggest the presence of an inverse relationship between personal achievement level and anxiety.",
        "More than half of OMS residents in the United States report moderate to severe anxiety. Higher levels of anxiety are associated with lower personal achievement levels. It is important to understand the negative impact anxiety has on trainees, including the unintended consequences."
