        "Prevalence estimates indicate that anxiety following spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common problem. However, methodological differences between studies may impact the clinical interpretation of these data.",
        "Data from 18 independent studies (Nparticipants=3158), which reported the prevalence of an anxiety disorder or associated symptoms, were identified from the Embase, PubMed and PsycInfo databases. Proportions were the primary effect size estimate. Confidence intervals, fail-safe Ns and the I(2) statistic were additionally calculated to identify the extent to which findings were robust and consistent across studies.",
        "Five per cent of participants met the criteria for either GAD or panic disorder, with Agoraphobia identified in 2.5%. These diagnostic data were, however, limited to two studies. Higher rates were noted for self-reported 'caseness' of anxiety, with 27% reporting clinically significant symptoms. Anxiety prevalence estimates varied across the individual self-report measures (range: 15-32%). Method of administration (range: 26-32%) did not impact significantly on these estimates nor did recruitment source, with similarly high anxiety levels reported by hospital (27%) and community (29%) samples.",
        "Early identification and treatment of anxiety are important in SCI rehabilitation, with a subgroup of individuals experiencing chronic symptoms. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for the interpretation of self-report data, including the use of clinical cutoffs."
