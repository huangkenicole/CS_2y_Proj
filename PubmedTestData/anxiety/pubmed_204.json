        "This study examined the effect of psychoeducational preparation 1-2 days prior to surgery on postoperative state anxiety among Egyptian bladder cancer patients with urinary diversion. The theoretical rationale was based upon the Betty Neuman Health-Care Systems Model. State anxiety was measured by the A-state form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. A total of 30 patients were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. Fifteen patients were included in each category. Preoperatively, the total sample was interviewed about their \"worries\" at that time, and data from this qualitative part were categorized into three subconcepts. Results revealed that their main anxieties are related to stress associated with being cancer patients followed by stress related to the impact of surgery on their bodies and on their social and marital life. Results from the quantitative part of the study showed that psychoeducational preparation lowered significantly state anxiety on the third day postoperatively and before discharge for those patients who had the intervention."
