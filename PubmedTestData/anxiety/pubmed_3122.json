        "Monitored anxiety level by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Corah's (1969a) dental anxiety scale and evaluated adjustment via behavioral ratings, in 32 female and 31 male dental surgery patients who were presented general or specific information prior to surgery. The findings indicated that dental surgery is a stressful procedure that elicits comparably high levels of state anxiety in males and females. For most patients, even those high in dental anxiety, state anxiety level returns to \"normal\" levels just after the completion of surgery. The dental anxiety scale administered well before surgery is a good predictor of patient anxiety level in the dental situation, especially for males. Females responded to an informational tape received prior to surgery with increased anxiety, and were rated as showing poorer overall adjustment in surgery than males. The general and specific information tapes did not differentially affect adjustment, but informational input and related variables such as patient expectancies and prior level of information are factors that need further investigation in terms of their potential relevance for the reduction of patient anxiety and enhancement of patient adjustment during dental procedures."
