        "With 68 women recently confined and terminating pregnancy by wish a study was made about anxiety in its two varieties: (i) as a mental condition connected with an actual and significant for the person life situation and (ii) as a personal feature--a way of perception and interpretation of the events as threatening. Anxiety's level is measured by a psychological test adapted to the Bulgarian conditions. The high average estimation of anxiety shows that termination of pregnancy is suffered as a stress. Subject to anxiety are also family's incomes when investigating both groups--women recently confined and women going to have an abortion. Level of anxiety of women recently confined is connected with the attitude towards future which definitely bothers 67.6 per cent of them. Analysis of indices shows that anxiety in connection with the decision for keeping or terminating of pregnancy as well as with the expected future after confinement is subject to many factors. Data interpretation confirms the well-known thesis that reproductive health protection is not only of a medical and biological but of very wide interdisciplinary interest when the woman is on the brink of the important for her personally and finally for the society as well decision pro and con real pregnancy."
