        "A comparison was made between muscle-relaxation training and relaxing music in the reduction of state and trait anxiety. Ss were 108 anxious female college students, half of whom received three sessions in muscle-relaxation training and half of whom received three sessions of relaxing music. Results indicate that both types of treatment significantly reduce state anxiety, but neither reduces trait anxiety. Results support Spielberger's state-trait anxiety theory and hold some implication for treatment."
