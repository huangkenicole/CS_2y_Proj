        "Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health problems in primary care. The PARADIES (Patient Activation foR Anxiety DIsordErS) intervention combined elements of cognitive behavioural therapy with case management and has demonstrated efficacy. Our aim was to explore patient characteristics, which may influence the course of anxiety symptoms over a 12 months period. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify associations of baseline characteristics (demographics, clinical parameters, medication use) with changes in anxiety symptoms as measured by the Beck anxiety inventory. Treatment modalities (e.g. adherence to appointment schedules) were considered as confounders. We examined univariate associations between dependent and independent variables before considering all independent variables in a multivariate final model. To find the best model to explain BAI score changes, we performed step-wise selection of independent variables based on Akaike information criteria. We tested for interaction terms between treatment allocation (intervention vs control) and independent variables using the multivariate model. We repeated these analyses in control vs intervention groups separately. From the original trial (N = 419), 236 patients (56.3%) were included. In the multivariate model, receiving the intervention (p<0.001), higher anxiety symptom severity (p<0.001) and longer illness duration at baseline (p = 0.033) were significantly associated with changes in anxiety symptom severity to the better while depression severity at baseline (p<0.001) was significantly associated with changes in anxiety symptoms to the worse. In stratified analyses, the control group showed significant associations between depression symptom severity and illness duration with anxiety symptom changes while baseline severity of anxiety symptoms remained significantly associated with anxiety symptom changes in both groups. A brief primary-care-based exposure training combined with case management is effective in a broad range of patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, including those with longer illness duration and co-existing symptoms of depression at baseline."
