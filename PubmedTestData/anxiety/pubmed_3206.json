        "116 boys and girls in elementary Grades 4, 5, and 6 were administered the General Anxiety Scale, Test Anxiety Scale, and the Shyness Scale. Their GPAs were obtained from school records as were Normal Curve Equivalents from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills given the previous school year. Children of divorced parents (n = 31) had lower GPAs than children of nondivorced parents (n = 85). The girls had higher GPAs and general anxiety scores than the boys. The students who scored lower on test anxiety had higher Normal Curve Equivalents. Pearson correlations were significant for scores on Test Anxiety with those on general anxiety (r = .57), GPA (r = -.25), and Normal Curve Equivalents (r = -.26). Normal Curve Equivalents correlated significantly with GPA (r = .66), but shyness did not correlate significantly with any other measure."
