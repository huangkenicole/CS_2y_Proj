        "As a congenital malformation that results in infertility and an inability to have vaginal intercourse, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome places a considerable psychological burden on patients, which results in anxiety symptoms. However, only single case studies or a few small to medium-sized cross-sectional studies were identified to focus on anxiety symptoms in MRKH patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the status of anxiety symptoms and the related factors in patients with MRKH syndrome.",
        "This cross-sectional study involving 141 patients with MRKH syndrome and 178 healthy women was conducted from January 2018 to December 2018. All participants were required to complete a demographic questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Scale for Chinese, and Chinese Version of the Female Sexual Function Index. The main outcome was the anxiety symptoms measured by the GAD-7. Main outcome was compared between the MRKH syndrome group and the healthy control group. Then, we explored the related factors by comparing patients with and without anxiety symptoms.",
        "Of the respondents, 24.1% experienced moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Patients with MRKH syndrome manifested more severe anxiety symptoms than healthy women. Negative self-evaluation of femininity (odds ratio [OR] 2.706, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.010-7.247), neurotic personality traits (OR 1.100, 95% CI 1.029-1.175), and coexisting depressive symptoms (OR 4.422, 95% CI 1.498-13.049) were more prevalent in anxious patients.",
        "The findings stress the importance of anxiety symptom screening in MRKH patients and identify patients at risk of anxiety symptoms, providing a possible basis for future intervention."
