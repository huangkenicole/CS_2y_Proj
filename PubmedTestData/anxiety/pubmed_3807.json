        "This study aimed to investigate death anxiety in advanced cancer patients and identify associated factors in the context of Chinese culture.",
        "Participants (N\u2009=\u2009270) with advanced cancer in a tertiary cancer hospital completed anonymous questionnaire surveys. Measures included\u00a0the Chinese version of a Likert-type Templer-Death Anxiety Scale, Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics, Student's t test, Pearson correlation test, and linear regression.",
        "Respondents returned 252 (93.33%) of the 270 questionnaires. The total CL-TDAS score was 39.56\u2009\u00b1\u200910.20. The top three items were \"I fear dying a painful death\" (3.59\u2009\u00b1\u20091.41), \"I often think about how shortly life really is\" (3.11\u2009\u00b1\u20091.33), and \"1 am not particularly afraid of getting cancer\" (3.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.35). Associated factors of death anxiety (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u2009.333, F\u2009=\u200915.756, p\u2009<\u2009.001) were the medical coping mode (resignation, confronce), self-esteem, the participants' adult children, the patient-primary caregivers' relationship, resilience, and the level of activity of daily living.",
        "Our results demonstrate high levels of death anxiety in advanced cancer patients. Generally, patients with adult children, high self-esteem and resilience had\u00a0low death anxiety. Conversely, patients with low levels of activity of daily living and high\u00a0coping mode (resignation, confrontation) reported high death anxiety. We determined that associated factors contributed to reduce death anxiety. Social interventions are recommended to improve the end-of-life transition for patients and caregivers."
