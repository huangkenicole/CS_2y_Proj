        "More than 60% of patients who undergo surgery for colorectal cancer experience anxiety at some point during the perioperative period. In addition to the obvious impact on the experience of the therapeutic process, the presence of anxiety has also been associated with the appearance of complications. Virtual reality could reduce it by simulating the controlled exposure of the patient to the conscious part of the surgical process.",
        "Single-center randomized clinical trial (NCT04058600) in which patients who were to undergo surgery for colorectal cancer and who had not previously undergone surgery as adults were exposed, prior to hospital admission, to virtual reality software in which all perioperative phases in which the patient is awake, from admission to discharge, were recreated. The main objective was to determine the presence of pre- and post-exposure anxiety using the validated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI-S) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).",
        "A total of 126 patients were recruited (58 exposed, 68 unexposed). There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, anesthetic risk, type of surgery. or levels of preoperative anxiety or depression. After exposure, all anxiety/depression rating scales decreased significantly.",
