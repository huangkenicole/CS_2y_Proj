        "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Despite an excellent survival rate, impairments are recognized in the quality of life and emotional well-being of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) survivors. Predictors for anxiety and depression in DTC patients are not well characterized. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> To identify predictors for anxiety and depression in DTC survivors. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In this cross-sectional study, all DTC survivors presenting for follow-up between 2014 and 2019 in a tertiary referral hospital were asked to complete the \"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\" (HADS). Depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) subscores were dichotomized for analysis. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of anxiety and depression. Inverse probability weighting was applied to correct for bias due to nonresponse. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Six hundred forty patients meeting study inclusion criteria completed the HADS questionnaire (73% female, mean age 50 years). Of these, 37.6% and 15.7% of patients demonstrated HADS-A and HADS-D scores \u22658. Female sex, elevated body mass index (BMI), permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve damage (RLND), permanent hypoparathyroidism (PH), comorbidities classified in chapter XIX of the <i>International Classification of Diseases</i>, 10th Revision (ICD-10; external causes of morbidity and mortality), and comorbidities in chapter XXI of ICD-10 (factors influencing health status and contact with health services) were independent predictors for elevated anxiety scores with adjusted odds ratios of 1.9 ([CI 1.2-3.2], <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01), 1.0 ([CI 1.0-1.1], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02), 2.6 ([CI 1.0-6.3], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04), 2.0 ([CI 1.1-3.5], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02), 5.5 ([CI 1.0-29.6], <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05), and 1.7 ([CI 1.1-2.6], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.03). PH, elevated anti-Tg titer, comorbidities of the digestive system (chapter XI of ICD-10), and comorbidities of the genitourinary system (chapter XIV of ICD-10) were independent predictors for depression with adjusted odds ratios of 2.2 ([CI 1.2-4.2], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01), 1.0 ([CI 1.0-1.0], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04), 3.0 ([CI 1.5-6.1], <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01), and 2.4 ([CI 1.0-5.7], <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Female sex, elevated BMI, RLND, PH, and comorbidities classified in chapter XIX and chapter XXI of ICD-10 are predictors for anxiety in DTC patients. PH, elevated anti-Tg titer, comorbidities of the digestive system, and comorbidities of the genitourinary system are predictors for depression in DTC patients. Physicians involved in the follow-up of DTC patients should devote particular attention to the emotional well-being in DTC patients with PH or permanent RLND."
