        "We investigated whether reduced anxiety predicted improved drinking outcomes over and above age of onset and ondansetron treatment among alcoholics enrolled in a clinical trial.",
        "Study design was a 2 (early onset alcoholics versus late onset alcoholics) x 4 (placebo and ondansetron 1, 4 and 16 micro g/kg twice daily) factorial randomized clinical trial during which all participants received weekly group cognitive behavioural therapy. Using weighted least squares regression, we examined the effects of ondansetron dose, age of onset, pre-treatment drinking and anxiety level (measured by Profile of Mood States) on end-state drinking behaviour. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ondansetron dose, age of onset and pre-treatment drinking influence end-state drinking behaviour.",
        "and conclusions: The present study added to our previous knowledge, indicating that when change in anxiety level was included as a predictor of end-state drinking, it also accounted for a significant proportion of the variance. Those who experienced decreases in anxiety during the treatment reported fewer drinks per day at their last visit compared with those who reported increases in anxiety."
