      "AbstractText": [
        "Although common among patients with heart failure, depression and anxiety have been relatively neglected by researchers and practitioners. Both depression and anxiety have been implicated in contributing independently to the poor outcomes seen in patients with heart failure. Emphasis in the literature is on physical symptom recognition and management, in contrast to the patient's perspective of the effects of heart failure on his or her daily life.",
        "This review summarizes and integrates research findings on anxiety and depression and translates these findings to clinical practice. Depression and anxiety are prevalent among patients with heart failure and require assessment and intervention. Short-term nonpharmacologic approaches, in conjunction with drug therapy, hold promise for successful management of patients who are depressed or anxious.",
        "Carefully designed clinical trials that are tailored to individual needs, yet are embedded within a systemic framework, are needed to inform clinicians regarding optimal practices for the treatment of patients with heart failure who suffer from depression or anxiety."
