        "Previous research and theory suggest that a person's anxiety level plays a functional role in determining his responsiveness to and appreciation of humor. Based upon the theoretical view that humor serves to dissipate anxiety, it was proposed that highly anxious individuals would respond more favourably to a therapist's use of humor than low trait-anxiety individuals. To test the hypothesis 87 undergraduate students in psychology were classified according to their measured level of trait anxiety (high or low, on the Spielberger Trait-Anxiety Inventory). Subjects evaluated a therapist who used humor in a written therapist-client dialogue. Results were contrary to prediction; an inverse relation between anxiety and appreciation of humor obtained."
