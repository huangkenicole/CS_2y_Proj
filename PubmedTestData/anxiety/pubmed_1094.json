        "This article provides an overview of anxiety disorders including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria with practical key features. The article discusses neurologic and other medical comorbidities as well as treatment strategies, keeping in mind the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders with depression.",
        "Several studies have emphasized the high prevalence of comorbid mental and medical conditions including, but not limited to, cardiovascular and neurologic illnesses, making the overall management of these patients more costly and complex, ultimately leading to decreased length and quality of life. However, several research studies have suggested that appropriate and effective comanagement of anxiety and depression improves overall outcomes of those individuals with chronic medical conditions.",
        "Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric conditions that not only co-occur, but also co-occur with other neurologic illnesses. Early recognition and treatment of these comorbidities are imperative in order to achieve better health outcomes for patients."
