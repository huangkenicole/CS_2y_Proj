        "This review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy of web or mobile-based (WMB) interventions impacting emotional symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.",
        "Articles published from 1991 to 2019 were identified using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus. Only interventions involving adults with advanced cancer using a WMB intervention to manage emotional symptoms were included. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I and ROB2 tools. Studies that reported mean symptom scores were pooled using a random-effects model, and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs were calculated.",
        "Twenty-three of the 1177 screened studies met the inclusion criteria, and a total sample of 2558 patients were included. The sample was 57% female, and 33% had advanced cancer with mean age of 57.15\u00a0years. Thirteen studies evaluated anxiety, nineteen evaluated depression, and eleven evaluated distress. Intervention components included general information, tracking, communication, multimedia choice, interactive online activities, tailoring/feedback, symptom management support content, and self-monitoring. Overall pooled results showed that WMB interventions' effects on decreasing anxiety (SMD\u2009-\u20090.20,\u2009-\u20090.45 to 0.05, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200972%), depression (SMD\u2009-\u20090.10,\u2009-\u20090.30 to 0.11, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200973%), and distress (SMD\u2009-\u20090.20,\u2009-\u20090.47 to 0.06, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200960%) were not significant for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast, WMB interventions significantly decreased symptoms of anxiety (p\u2009=\u2009.002) in a sub-group analysis of non-RCTs.",
        "This meta-analysis demonstrated that WMB interventions were not efficacious in alleviating emotional symptoms in adults with advanced cancer. Considering the diversity of interventions, the efficacy of WMB interventions and its impacts on emotional symptoms should be further explored."
