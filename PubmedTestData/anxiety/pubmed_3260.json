        "Even under normal circumstances, anxiety is quite common among nursing students. Therefore, this study compared nursing students' health and coronavirus anxiety in two European countries.",
        "The sample of the descriptive, cross-sectional study consisted of 685 undergraduate students studying at two different nursing schools in Turkey and Portugal. The study data were collected with the Personnel Data Collection Form, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Short Health Anxiety Inventory.",
        "While there was no difference between the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale scores of Turkish and Portuguese nursing students (<i>p</i> > .05), a statistically significant difference was found between the Short Health Anxiety Inventory total scores and negative consequences scores (<i>p</i> < .05).",
        "Against the pandemic that the whole world is experiencing, it is recommended to compare nursing students in a cultural context and take precautions."
