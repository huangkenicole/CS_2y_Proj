      "AbstractText": [
        "The increasing use of digital mental health (DMH) platforms and digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) is hindered by uncertainty over effectiveness, quality and usability. There is a need to identify the types of available evidence in this domain.",
        "This study is a scoping review identifying evaluation of the (1) DMH platform/s used; and (2) DMHI/s applied on the DMH platform/s.",
        "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guided the review process. Empirical studies that focused on evaluation of the use and application of DMH platforms were included from journal articles (published 2012-2022). A literature search was conducted using four electronic databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, Sage and ACM Digital Library) and two search engines (PubMed and Google Scholar).",
        "A total of 6874 nonduplicate records were identified, of which 144 were analyzed and 22 met the inclusion criteria. The review included general/unspecified mental health and/or suicidality indications (<i>n</i> = 9, 40.9%), followed by depression (<i>n</i> = 5, 22.7%), psychosis (<i>n</i> = 3, 13.6%), anxiety and depression (<i>n</i> = 2, 9.1%), as well as anxiety, depression and suicidality (<i>n</i> = 1, 4.5%), loneliness (<i>n</i> = 1, 4.5%), and addiction (<i>n</i> = 1, 4.5%). There were 11 qualitative studies (50%), 8 quantitative studies (36.4%), and 3 mixed-methods studies (<i>n</i> = 3, 13.6%). The results contained 11 studies that evaluated the DMH platform/s and 11 studies that evaluated the DMHI/s. The studies focused on feasibility, usability, engagement, acceptability and effectiveness. There was a small amount of significant evidence (1 in each 11), notably the (cost-)effectiveness of a DMHI with significant long-term impact on anxiety and depression in adults.",
        "The empirical research demonstrates the feasibility of DMH platforms and DMHIs. To date, there is mostly heterogeneous, preliminary evidence for their effectiveness, quality and usability. However, a scalable DMHI reported effectiveness in treating adults' anxiety and depression. The scope of effectiveness may be widened through targeted strategies, for example by engaging independent young people."
