        "The current study examined associations of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, and generalized anxiety disorder [GAD] with alcohol consumption and drinking to cope in a sample of 310 nurses during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Using a cross-sectional design, nurses completed online surveys.",
        "Over 50% of the sample reported alcohol misuse and 12.2% reported drinking to cope. Further, 38.7% reported elevated symptoms of PTSD, 29.7% moderate-to-high symptoms of depression, and 56.8% elevated symptoms of GAD symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine how mental health symptoms were associated with alcohol outcomes, controlling for age, gender pronouns, education, and race. No significant predictors emerged for alcohol consumption. Significant associations of symptoms of PTSD and depression were found for drinking to cope, such that higher levels of mental health symptoms were associated with greater endorsement of drinking to cope.",
        "Results are discussed in light of increasing prevention and support services for nurses."
