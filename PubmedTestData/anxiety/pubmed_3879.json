        "Children undergoing surgery and general anesthesia often experience preoperative anxiety (POA) with related negative short-, medium- and long-term consequences. Anxiolytic premedication has negative side effects, and nonpharmacologic interventions are often resource demanding and not always readily available in a busy clinical setting. The use of an age-appropriate game on a tablet computer may reduce POA, postoperative pain, and occurrence of emergence delirium (ED).",
        "Children aged 3 to 6\u00a0years scheduled to undergo elective minor surgery were randomly assigned to play a game on a tablet computer while in the holding area before anesthesia (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or prepared as per departmental standard only (n\u00a0=\u00a030).",
        "POA, ED, and levels of pain were assessed by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium, and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale, respectively.",
        "A total of 60 children were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. Gender, bodyweight, duration of anesthesia and surgery, and fentanyl dosages were comparable between the two groups. Tablet-gaming children tended to be less anxious than control subjects at the time of anesthesia induction (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, 55.7 vs 65.8; 95% confidence interval,\u00a0-0.63 to 20.8; P\u00a0= .066). There was no difference in occurrence of ED or pain 20\u00a0minutes after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit.",
        "Although not statistically significant, the use of an age-appropriate tablet computer game may reduce the level of anxiety at the anesthetic induction in 3 to 6 years old children undergoing elective day-case surgery. However, the occurrence of ED and levels of pain appeared unaffected. Standardization of nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce perioperative anxiety and pain is required."
