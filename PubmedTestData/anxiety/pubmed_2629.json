        "Depression and anxiety are typically measured in college samples using adult scales. However, some child and adolescent versions of internalizing symptoms may be appropriate for use with college samples. Child versions may be appropriate to use with college samples when multi-sample designs are utilized, e.g., both children and adults are assessed. To explore this possibility, 149 college students (M age=21.9 yr., SD=6.3; 43 men, 106 women) were assessed on child and adolescent versions and adult scales of anxiety, i.e., the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and depression, i.e., the Children's Depression Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Both sets of depression scores were highly correlated (r = .81), which suggests that the children's measure can be used in college samples. Although scores on the two anxiety scales were also significantly correlated, these scales shared less common variance. An exploratory factor analysis provided evidence that a single factor composed of all items for depression was an optimal solution. It was concluded that the Children's Depression Inventory can be used with college samples; however, the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale should not."
