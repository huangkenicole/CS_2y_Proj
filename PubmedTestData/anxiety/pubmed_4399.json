        "Previous research regarding the fatigued patient has dealt primarily with the diagnostic labels applied by physicians, rather than specific presenting symptoms of the fatigued patient. The purpose of the present study was to identify, based on presenting symptoms, gender, marital status, and race, relatively homogeneous sub-groups within a sample of fatigued patients that would aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disorder(s). Results of cluster analysis suggested the presence of an Organic, Anxiety, Depression, and Mixed Anxiety/Depression group within the sample of 197 fatigued patients. Significant differences among these four groups were found on 13 of the 15 symptoms included in the cluster analysis. The proportion of males, married patients, and white patients in the Organic Group was significantly greater than in the other three inorganic clusters as a whole. Positive or negative responses to these 13 symptoms can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of the fatigued patient."
