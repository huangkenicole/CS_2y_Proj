        "Post-event processing (PEP) refers to negative rumination following anxiety-inducing social situations. The Post-Event Processing Inventory (PEPI; Blackie & Kocovski, 2017, Development and validation of the trait and state versions of the post-event processing inventory. Anxiety, Stress, & Coping, 30, 202-218.) consists of both trait and state forms. Although the psychometric properties of the PEPI have been very good in past research, the factor structure of the scale was examined with student samples only.",
        "The primary purpose of the present study was to confirm the factor structure of the PEPI with a sample of individuals seeking self-help for social anxiety and shyness.",
        "Individuals interested in receiving self-help (N\u2009=\u2009155) completed a battery of questionnaires, including the trait and state forms of the PEPI.",
        "On each version of the scale, we confirmed that a second-order factor (global PEP) could be inferred from three first-order factors (frequency, intensity, and self-judgment).",
        "The hierarchical factor structure of the PEPI in the present study is consistent with previous research. The findings from the present study illustrate the utility of the PEPI amongst a community sample of individuals seeking self-help for social anxiety."
