        "In our previous reports on the same general topic, we exploited research in Oriental psychosomatic medicine to obtain diagnoses through visual observation of the sublingual vein (useful for the early detection of vital energy stagnation and blood stasis) from a computerized color analysis of the tongue proper, its coating, and the sublingual vein. This led us to develop the concept of the anxiety-affinitive constitution, based on unbalanced qi, blood, and body fluid in ill-health as a causative factor for stress-related diseases and lifestyle illnesses. As a development of this research, the present report examines the verification of possible links of ill-health, lifestyle illness, and stress-related disease through the diagnosis and treatment of functional subclinical psychosomatic disorders detected as a clinical expression of the anxiety-affinitive constitution. First, a diagnosis of functional subclinical psychosomatic disorders (ill-health) in 197 medical school students, including 156 first-year students at medical and nursing schools made it clear that the trait anxiety forming the core of the anxiety-affinitive constitution is linked to Dr. Lester Breslow's seven good health habits, and the manner of respiration. Second, it was revealed during the treatment of functional subclinical psychosomatic disorders in eight medical students that kampo medication and relaxation training (RT) produce lowered scores for STAI trait anxiety, and transform respiration from thoracic pattern to a balanced thoracic and abdominal respiratory pattern. This was particularly true for RT. Finally, we concluded that a high score for trait anxiety correlates to the formation of inappropriate health habits, and the habituation of inadequate respiration (thoracic pattern). Therefore, lifestyle illness or stress-related diseases will develop unless an anxiety-affinitive constitution is improved with kampo medication and/or RT."
