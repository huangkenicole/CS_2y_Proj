      "AbstractText": [
        "The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to children's daily lives due in part to stay-at-home orders and school closures, reducing interactions with both peers and extended family. Yet, few studies with nationally representative data have explored the potential association of the COVID-19 pandemic and children's mental health.",
        "The current study analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe changes in the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression before and during the first year of the pandemic among children aged 5-17 years. Changes in prevalence by child- and family-level characteristics were also examined.",
        "During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly one in six children aged 5-17 years had daily or weekly symptoms of anxiety or depression, a significant increase from before the COVID-pandemic (16.7% (95% CI:15.0-18.6) versus 14.4% (95% CI:13.4-15.3)). Males, children 5-11 years, non-Hispanic children, children living in families in large metropolitan areas, incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and whose highest educated parent had more than a HS education, also showed statistically significant increases in anxiety and depression symptoms.",
        "NHIS data may be used to monitor this increase in mental health symptomatology and assist in identifying children at risk."
