        "Gene-environment interaction is identified as the determinant in anxiety. ABO blood types represent a part of the genetic phenotype. Therefore, we assume ABO blood types correlate with preoperative anxiety. This cross-sectional study enrolled 352 patients with different ABO blood types, scheduled for elective surgery between 2018 and 2019 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University. HADS (hospital anxiety and depression scale) scores and VA (visual analogue scales for anxiety) scores were all used to assess the preoperative anxiety in the A, B, AB, and O groups. Bivariate correlation and logistic regression were performed to identify relationships between preoperative anxiety and related variables. A significant difference in VA and HADS-A (anxiety) scores was found between the AB and other groups. The ratio of preoperative anxiety was 3.73 (95% CI [confidence interval]: 2.32-6.00, <i>P</i> < 0.001) times in female than in male; 0.36 (95% CI: 0.21-0.63, <i>P</i> < 0.001) times in ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade II than in grade I; 0.41 (95% CI: 0.20-0.86, <i>P</i> < 0.05) times in ASA grade III than in grade I; 1.25 (95% CI: 1.1-1.41, <i>P</i> < 0.001) times in higher VAS (visual analogue scales for pain) scores than in lower VAS scores; and 0.28 (95% CI: 0.16-0.49, <i>P</i> < 0.01) times in non-AB blood type than in AB blood type. Differences in ABO blood types were found in preoperative anxiety, and the AB group displayed a high preoperative anxiety level. ABO blood types, sex, ASA grade, and VAS were associated with preoperative anxiety. This trial is registered with ChiCTR1800019390."
