        "Individuals with gender dysphoria have disproportionately high rates of depression and anxiety compared to the cisgender population. Although the benefits of gender affirmation surgery have been well documented, it is unclear whether depression and anxiety affect postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PRO).",
        "The authors evaluated the impact of preoperative anxiety or depression on clinical and PRO in patients undergoing chest masculinization surgery.",
        "Patients who underwent chest masculinization surgery within a 5-year period were reviewed. Demographics and clinical variables were abstracted from medical records. PRO of chest, nipple, and scar satisfaction were obtained postoperatively with the BODY-Q. Groups were stratified by preoperative anxiety, preoperative depression, both, or no history of mental health diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.",
        "Of 135 patients with complete survey responses, 10.4% had anxiety, 11.9% depression, 20.7% both diagnoses, and 57.0% no diagnosis. Clinical data and outcomes were similar. Patients with preoperative depression correlated with lower satisfaction scores for scar appearance (P = .006) and were significantly more likely to report feelings of depression postoperatively (P = .04). There were no significant differences in chest or nipple satisfaction among groups.",
        "Although anxiety and depression are prevalent in gender minorities, we found no association with postoperative clinical outcomes. Patients with preoperative depression were more likely to report lower satisfaction with scar appearance and feelings of depression postoperatively. However, there were no differences in chest or nipple satisfaction. These results highlight the importance of perioperative mental health counseling but also suggest that patients can be satisfied with their results despite a coexisting mental health diagnosis."
