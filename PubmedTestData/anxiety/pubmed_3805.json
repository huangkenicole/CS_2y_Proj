        "Early life stress has a significant impact on development of the central nervous system (CNS), with lasting rather than transient consequences; therefore, it is important to alleviate these effects. In recent years, functional communication between the CNS and gut microbiota through the so-called brain-gut-microbiota axis has been examined, and it is likely that prebiotics contribute to development of the CNS through the gut microbiota. In this study, we performed behavioral, neurohistological, and fecal microbiota analyses in early-weaned mice to examine the effects of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), a human milk oligosaccharide, on anxiety induced by early life stress. Mice weaned at 17\u2009d old (17-d mice) showed anxiety-like behaviors, such as decreased time in the open arms in the elevated plus maze test, compared to mice weaned at 24\u2009d old (24-d mice). The number of cells that were positive for the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in the amygdala was also higher in 17-d mice. The behavioral and neural abnormalities caused by early weaning were alleviated by post-weaning ingestion of 2'-FL. The composition of the fecal microbiota differed among control diet-fed 24-d and 17-d mice, and 2'-FL diet-fed 17-d mice. These findings indicate that human milk oligosaccharides 2'-FL alleviate early stress-induced anxiety, amygdala hyperactivity, and gut microbiota changes."
