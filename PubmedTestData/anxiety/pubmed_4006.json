        "This project is a first attempt to record the psychological experiences fathers have during their wives' pregnancies, and in particular to record the degree of anxiety fathers suffer during the third trimester, in order to take this under consideration in Maternity Education classes. This is an exploratory study which is based on the hypothesis that fathers suffer diverse levels of anxiety during their wives' pregnancies and these are increased due to including fathers in the delivery room. This study was carried out in May and June 1996 in the Maternity Education Units under the auspices of the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital on those fathers who participated in the maternity education sessions. According to the data obtained in this study, the degree of anxiety depends on various factors: age and cultural-economical level. Pregnancy is a source of anxiety in fathers which alters a couple's relationship. Therefore, we should help fathers by means of a maternity education program so that fathers become a source of assistance to their pregnant wives and not a source of worries."
