        "We sought to determine whether a selection process for deployment had a measurable effect on psychological symptoms by comparing scores on the Yatabe-Guilford Personality Index, the Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the 30-item version of the General Health Questionnaire between deployed and nondeployed mission candidates from the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The studies were undertaken in Japan during education and training for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights. The participants included 80 candidates for deployment. Personnel who were not deployed had significantly higher measures of manifest anxiety and general psychological distress than deployed personnel, whereas deployed personnel showed more symptoms suggesting somatization. The selection process and training for deployment appear to have been stressful for all personnel, whether deployed or not."
