        "The levels of agreement between self- and parent/proxy-reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pediatric epilepsy were evaluated. Data were drawn from 56 pairs of children with epilepsy and at least one parent. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), while depressive symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (MFQ). Moderate to substantial levels of agreement between raters when reporting various anxiety symptoms, such as panic/somatic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and school phobia symptoms, were observed. Levels of agreement between raters were substantial when reporting depressive symptoms. However, levels of agreement differed if raw or criterion-referenced questionnaires' scores were used. In case of using raw questionnaire scores, substantial agreements appeared when reporting overall anxiety and depressive symptoms. On the other hand, moderate agreements appeared when reporting particular anxiety symptoms with raw questionnaire scores or when using criterion-referenced scores that indicate the presence of certain symptoms in a clinical range. Therefore, it is advisable to include both raters when assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms in pediatric epilepsy."
