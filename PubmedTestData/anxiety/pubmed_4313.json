        "This study applied a differential stress reduction paradigm to an alcoholic population. The paradigm was tested by designing stress management procedures to match alcoholics' locus of control. Subjects were 55 participants in an alcohol dependency treatment program at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Three-channel assessment of general anxiety with seven separate measures was conducted; data were collected at pretesting, posttesting, and at an 8-week follow-up. A two-factor design was used, incorporating multivariate analyses of covariance. Findings supported the hypothesis that matching the treatment control orientation with trainee locus of control enhances outcome. Results also showed a significant difference in outcome between types of locus of control, with internal locus of control subjects performing better. There were no significant differences in the treatment group comparisons."
