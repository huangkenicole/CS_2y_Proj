        "The aim of this study is to work out a theoretical model that would at once be able to tackle the connection between emotions, thoughts, language and actions, since man has constant contact with others during his life, and to recognize the single basic concepts deriving from anxiety and desire. Our main concern is to follow the outcomes of anxiety, in order to understand how it is avoided, by which mental and emotional forms and ways of behaviour. Hence one can find the result of this process in interaction with others. In this perspective the process of meaning is autonomous, and neutrality is not only interpreted as a therapeutic directive, but as a fundamental aim of the therapy, related to controlling the anxiety and emotions which fill the field of conscience during interaction with the other."
