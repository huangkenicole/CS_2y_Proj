        "In order to determine the interpersonal distancing requirements for emotionally disturbed and normal children and in order to investigate the relationship of locus of control and anxiety to interpersonal space, 20 emotionally disturbed and 20 normal boys were randomly required to approach an object person and to let the object person approach them until they felt uncomfortable. Results indicated that emotionally disturbed boys required more space than normals; that subjects would approach closer than they would allow the object person to approach them; and that externals required more space than internals. There were no significant differences between high and low anxious subjects, nor between emotionally disturbed children diagnostically classified as overanxious reaction and those with other diagnosis. Finally, neither anxiety nor locus of control explained the significant normal-emotionally disturbed differences in space requirements. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed as well as the relationship between the present and previous research."
