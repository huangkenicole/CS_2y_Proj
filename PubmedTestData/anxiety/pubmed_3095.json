        "Individuals post-stroke are subject to increased levels of mental health symptoms. This is a cross-sectional study explored levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and identified their predictors among Jordanian individuals with stroke. Outcome measures included Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment, goniometry, hand-held dynamometry, nine-hole peg test, Ashworth scale, Motor Activity Log, ten-meter walk test, and 12-item Short-Form health survey (SF-12). Descriptive analyses were used to describe prevalence of mental health symptoms and multiple variable linear regression models were used to identify their predictors. A total of 153 individuals participated in the study. Proportions of participants with mental health symptoms were 74.5% for depression, 52.9% for anxiety, and 68% for stress. Significant predictors of post-stroke mental health symptoms were SF-12 Mental Composite Score and grip strength for depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression and stress symptoms were significantly associated with discontinuation of rehabilitation services. Furthermore, self-reports of fewer sleep hours was significantly associated with anxiety and stress. Finally, Gender and self-reported physical diseases other than stroke were significantly associated with depression symptoms. We conclude that high proportions of Jordanian individuals' post-stroke have suffered mental health symptoms. Future studies are required to design effective interventions to improve post-stroke mental health."
