        "Modeling cognitive processes that link variables associated with maladaptive behavior has led to successful interventions, particularly for alcohol use. In the present study, Individual Differences Scaling (INDSCAL) was used to model the cognitive structure of appearance-related comparisons in relation to physical appearance related anxiety and drive for thinness (DT) among 635 college students. Results were consistent with previous work in finding two primary comparison dimensions. A weight/nonweight dimension was primarily emphasized by females and a muscle/nonmuscle dimension was primarily emphasized by males. These gender differences continued to be evident when females and males were matched on levels of appearance-related anxiety and DT. Gender-specific analyses indicated that females with higher levels of appearance-related anxiety and DT primarily emphasized the weight dimension while females with lower levels of these characteristics tended to emphasize a physical attractiveness dimension. Males with higher levels of appearance-related anxiety and DT also primarily emphasized the weight dimension while males with lower levels of these characteristics tended to emphasize a muscle-related dimension. Findings are discussed in terms of risk factors for disturbance, and as a means of improving assessment, treatment, and prevention strategies."
