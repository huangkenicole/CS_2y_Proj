        "Patients undergoing surgery are anxious owing to the surgery, anesthesia, and unfamiliar environment of the operation theater. This anxiety can hamper the health and recovery of the patients. Among various nonpharmacologic modalities available, music can be used as a coping strategy to change uncomfortable conditions to the pleasant ones.",
        "To evaluate the role of music on perioperative anxiety, hemodynamic parameters, and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries under spinal anesthesia.",
        "Tertiary care hospital, randomized control trial.",
        ": The study was conducted after approval by Hospital Ethical Committee on 70 adult patients of either gender scheduled to undergo lower limb surgeries under spinal anesthesia. In group M (n\u2009=\u200935), patients listened to standard relaxation music, and in group C (n\u2009=\u200935), patients listened to standard operation theater noise tape through noise canceling headphones. The intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Perioperative anxiety was assessed using visual analog scale for anxiety. Sedation score was observed using observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale. Patient's satisfaction was also assessed in both the groups.",
        "Student t test, Chi-squared test, and paired sample t test.",
        ": In group M, heart rate was lower when compared with group C. The difference was statistically significant at 10 minutes of assessment (P\u2009=\u20090.003) and statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) for rest of the time period. Statistically significant lower respiratory rate was there in group M when compared with group C (P\u2009=\u20090.05). Patients were more satisfied in the music group when compared with control group.",
        "The potential of music therapy can be used to allay patient anxiety, stabilize hemodynamics, and improve patient satisfaction."
