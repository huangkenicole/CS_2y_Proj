        "People with multiple health risk behaviors (HRBs) are at higher risk for psychological problems, and vice versa. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown.",
        "We collected questionnaire and blood sample data from 2 universities in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. Demographic information, HRBs and blood samples were collected at baseline. Depression/anxiety symptoms were collected using questionnaires at follow-up. Latent class analysis was used to explore clustered HRBs pattern, and logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between clustered HRBs quantity, pattern and anxiety-depression symptoms comorbidity. The Mplus software was used to analyze the moderating effects of inflammatory cytokines.",
        "Compared to the HRB low-risk group, the substance dependence group (OR: 1.89, 95%CI: 1.11-3.21) and sedentary group (OR: 2.98, 95%CI: 1.48-6.02) had a higher risk of anxiety-depression comorbid symptoms. Compared to participants with no clustered HRBs, participants with 2 HRBs (OR: 2.16 95%CI: 1.17-4.00) and >3 HRBs (OR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.68-7.48) were more likely to suffer from comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression. Moreover, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 had negative moderating effects between clustered HRBs pattern and comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression.",
        "Recall bias may exist for anxiety / depression symptoms, and cannot exclude unmeasured confounders or the effect of residual confounding.",
        "This study finds clustered HRBs have a significant impact on mental health among young adults, and inflammatory cytokine evidence supports a negative moderating effect on the relationship. Interventions that decrease clustered HRBs may support mental health development in adolescence."
