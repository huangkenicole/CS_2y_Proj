        "Research examining the relationship between metacognitions and cancer has only recently begun to emerge. This study attempted to compare the metacognitions of the patients with and without cancer. The effects of stage of cancer, type of cancer, and treatment modality (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, operation) on metacognitions were investigated. Patients with cancer were hypothesized to have higher levels of negative metacognitions.",
        "Participants were patients with cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a0279) and patients without cancer (control group, N\u00a0=\u00a0212). The Metacognition Questionnaire-30 was administered to all participants. Results were analyzed according to demographic and histopathological characteristics of the patients.",
        "The results showed that patients with different cancer diagnoses scored higher than the controls on all subscales of the MCQ-30. Those who received chemotherapy scored the highest on the MCQ-30. The patients who were in early stages of cancer had higher levels of negative metacognitions. Patients who did not have operation but had chemotherapy had the highest levels of negative metacognitions. Patients who were in locally advanced stage, did not have operation but had received or was receiving chemotherapy had the highest levels of negative metacognitions.",
        "Patients who were in early stages of cancer appeared to be in greater need for psychological help and access to services. Findings indicated a need for psychological support for patients who undergo chemotherapy."
