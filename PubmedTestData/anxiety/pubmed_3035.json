        "In this preregistered study, we investigated the beneficial effects of music-based casual video game training on the depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in a cohort of young individuals with subthreshold depression and the underlying mechanisms.",
        "The study included 56 young individuals (18-26 years of age) with subthreshold or mild depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores between 14 and 19. They were randomly assigned into the experimental group (<i>n</i> = 28) or the control group (<i>n</i> = 28). The experimental group underwent music-based casual video game training for 4 weeks. During the same time, the control group participants conducted daily life activities without any intervention. The study participants in the two groups were analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) during the baseline before the intervention, as well as DASS-21, Positive and negative Affect Scale (PANAS), General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) twice a week during the 4 weeks of intervention.",
        "The depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were significantly reduced in the experimental group participants after 4 weeks of music-based video game training compared with the control group. The DAS scores in the experimental group were alleviated in the third and fourth weeks of training compared with the control group. Moreover, analysis using the general linear model demonstrated that the number of training weeks and self-efficacy were associated with significant reduction in depression, anxiety and stress. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that self-efficacy was correlated with positive emotion and emotional regulation.",
        "Our study showed that music-based casual video game training significantly decreased depression, anxiety, and stress in the young individuals with subthreshold depression by enhancing self-efficacy."
