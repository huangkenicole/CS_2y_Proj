      "AbstractText": [
        "This study compared pain and anxiety levels in individuals receiving intravitreal injections (IVIs) using a speculum-free injection technique, the lid splinting eyelid retraction technique, or using a speculum.",
        "This was a prospective study of individuals receiving IVI at a single tertiary care medical center who responded to a questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) between December 2019 and January 2020. In one group, a speculum was used prior to injection, whereas in the other group, a speculum-free injection technique was used.",
        "A total of 108 individuals were included in this study: 54 received IVI with the speculum-free lid splinting eyelid retraction technique and 54 received IVI with a speculum. A correlation between pain and anxiety was demonstrated in the control group (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01); however, in the speculum-free group, this correlation was lower and not significant. When comparing pain and anxiety between the study groups, lower median pain (Mood's: Z\u2009=\u20095.378, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001) and lower anxiety (Mood's: Z\u2009=\u20092.108, p-value\u2009=\u20090.035) scores were demonstrated in the speculum-free group than in the control group. The distribution of pain scores was significantly different between the study groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov: D\u2009=\u20090.518, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001), and trending differences in anxiety between the groups were observed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov: D\u2009=\u20090.259, p-value\u2009=\u20090.053).",
        "The lid splinting eyelid retraction technique, a speculum-free technique, was associated with less anxiety and pain in patients than the use of a speculum. As IVI often involves repeated treatment, identifying modifiable factors that may relieve anxiety and pain is of utmost importance."
