        "Australia has warmed by 1.4\u00b0C since pre-industrial times. This is greater than the global average and is predicted to exceed 1.5\u00b0C by 2030. This will have significant environmental effects that can threaten human wellbeing. Most Australians have direct experience of\u00a0climate change-related events, with health, social, cultural and economic impacts already evident and wide-ranging implications for mental health.",
        "This article provides an overview of climate distress, which encompasses both 'climate anxiety' and other forms of distress related to climate change. It outlines the\u00a0features and prevalence of climate distress, as well as\u00a0approaches for assessment and management based on\u00a0current evidence and theory.",
        "Climate distress is common and can take many forms. These concerns may not be readily disclosed, but can be\u00a0sensitively elicited, and patients may benefit from the opportunity for empathic, non-judgemental exploration of their experiences. Care must be taken not to pathologise rational distress while identifying maladaptive coping strategies and serious mental illness. Management should focus on adaptive coping strategies, use evidence\u2011based psychological interventions and draw upon emerging evidence about behavioural engagement, nature connection and group processes."
