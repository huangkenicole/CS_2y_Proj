        "End-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and respiratory rate (RR) responses were measured during sustained isometric muscle contraction (SIMC) (40% of maximum voluntary contraction of quadriceps for 2 min) and during a 5-meter walk. Falls efficacy scale (FES) and Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD).",
        "Patients with fear of falling had significantly higher FES and HAD scores (p < .01). During SIMC, baseline and nadir PETCO2 levels were significantly lower in patients with a fear of falling (p < .01). During the 5-meter walk, PETCO2 was lower at baseline, at nadir, and at the end of the walk in the fear of falling group than in controls (p < .01). RR was higher at nadir and end of the walk in the fear of falling group than in controls (p < .02).",
        "Hypocapnia may occur in patients with a fear of falling during SIMC and walking. Anxiety seems to be the main cause, but muscle weakness may contribute. Breathing or relaxation techniques and reconditioning may have a role in treating fear of falling in the rehabilitation setting."
