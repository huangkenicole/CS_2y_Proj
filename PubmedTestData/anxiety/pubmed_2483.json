        "<b>Objectives:</b> Worry has been shown to have a negative impact on many aspects of neurocognitive performance. Interestingly, research indicates mindfulness both improves aspects of cognitive ability and reduces worry symptoms. Yet, the impact of mindfulness on the relationship between worry and cognition has yet to be explored. Based on research discussed herein, we hypothesize that those with higher levels of dispositional mindfulness will have better cognitive performance than those with lower levels of dispositional mindfulness, regardless of worry level. The present study investigated the potential moderating influence of mindfulness on the relationship between worry and cognitive performance.<b>Methods:</b> The sample included 113 older veterans who were screened at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in Palo Alto, CA. Cognitive domains of interest included learning and memory, processing speed, attention, working memory, and executive function. Mindfulness was assessed with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and worry symptoms were assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Hypotheses were tested with multiple regression analyses using the Hayes (2003) PROCESS macro.<b>Results:</b> Contrary to what was hypothesized, only mindful awareness significantly moderated the relationship between worry and processing speed.<b>Conclusion:</b> This finding has important implications for introducing mindfulness techniques into older adults' routines to decrease worry and mitigate its negative effects on processing speed."
