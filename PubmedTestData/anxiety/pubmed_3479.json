        "Medical students in China and other non-English speaking countries are susceptible to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing anxiety. English writing is not only a vital component tested for admission to postgraduate and doctoral programs, but it is also critical for the publication of academic papers. Although there is mounting evidence indicating relationships between anxiety, self-esteem and mobile phone addiction, pathways between these three constructs within a structural equation model have not yet been examined. Furthermore, there has been a dearth of studies exploring EFL writing anxiety, from which medical students in China as well as other non-English speaking countries are prone to suffer. The study was to assess EFL writing anxiety among Chinese medical students and to examine the relationships between EFL writing anxiety, self-esteem, and mobile phone addiction, with an aim to offer empirical evidence for effective preventive or intervention measures to alleviate EFL writing anxiety. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1,238 medical students in China, with the administration of a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory (SLWAI), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS). The results indicated that both self-esteem and mobile phone addiction exerted significant direct effects on EFL writing anxiety. Self-esteem also had a significant indirect effect on EFL writing anxiety via the mediating role of mobile phone addiction. The path coefficients of self-esteem on EFL writing anxiety were significantly reduced when mobile phone addiction was modeled as a mediator. Efforts to alleviate EFL writing anxiety among medical students may benefit from enhancing self-esteem and establishing a healthy relationship with mobile phones."
