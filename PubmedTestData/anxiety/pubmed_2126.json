        "Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a distinct clinical entity characterized by a chief complaint of unremitting oral burning concomitant with no oral mucosal clinically observable lesions. Numerous causes of this condition have been suggested, including local factors, systemic factors, and psychogenic disorders. A total of 33 consecutive subjects, 29 women and 4 men, complaining of BMS, who had attended the Dental Clinic of the University of Ferrara during a period of 2 years, was studied. The results obtained using a specific questionnaire to assess the psychological status of BMS patients were reported. Psychological factors were present in more than two thirds of the subjects (67%). Anxiety was the predominant disorder and the most recalcitrant obstacle to cure. On the other side, an improvement of the psychogenic state was observed in relation to burning reduction. Furthermore, a remission or resolution of the oral symptoms following a reassurance alone as to the benign nature of the condition was found in 24% of the patients. These results seem to suggest an association between oral complaint and personality disturbance. However, whether the psychogenic disorder is causative or whether it is a result of the burning sensation is still uncertain."
