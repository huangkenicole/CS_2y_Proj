        "We synthesized the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on psychological outcomes in college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Ten electronic databases were searched from inception to December 2021. We reviewed studies with college and university students receiving MBIs\u00a0with psychological outcomes. We only reviewed studies written in English. A random-effects model was used to compute the effect size.",
        "Overall, MBIs\u00a0showed a significantly moderate improvement in anxiety (g\u2009=\u20090.612, 95%\u00a0CI: 0.288-0.936, I<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u200977%); depression (g\u2009=\u20090.372, 95%\u00a0CI: 0.032-0.713, I<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u200972%); and mindfulness (g\u2009=\u20090.392, 95% CI:0.102-0.695, I<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u200964%) compared with control groups, while these interventions had a small effect in reducing stress, but not a significant one (g\u2009=\u20090.295, 95%\u00a0CI: -0.088 to\u00a00.676, I<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u200977%) compared with control groups.",
        "MBIs\u00a0significantly improved psychological outcomes among college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians and health providers should consider using MBIs as alternative complementary treatment for improving and preventing anxiety and depression in college and university students during COVID-19.",
        "The use of MBIs for college and university students is an effective method to decrease anxiety, depressive symptoms, and increase mindfulness. MBIs would become a very useful means of alternative complementary treatment in mental health and clinical psychiatry."
