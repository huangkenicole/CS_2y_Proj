        "Although substantial human and animal evidence suggests a role for the amygdala in anxiety, literature linking amygdala volume to anxiety symptomatology is inconclusive, with studies finding positive, negative, and null results. Clarifying this brain-behavior relation in middle to late childhood is especially important, as this is a time both of amygdala structural maturation and the emergence of many anxiety disorders. The goal of the current study was to clarify inconsistent findings in previous literature by identifying factors moderating the relation between amygdala volume and anxiety traits in a large sample of typically developing children aged 6-13 years (N = 72). In particular, we investigated the moderating effects of informant (parent vs. child), age, and sex. We found that children's reports (i.e., self-reports) were related to amygdala volume; children who reported higher anxiety levels had smaller amygdalae. This negative relation between amygdala volume and anxiety weakened with age. There was also an independent effect of sex, such that relations were stronger in males than in females. These results indicate the importance of considering sample and informant characteristics when charting the neurobiological mechanisms underlying developmental anxiety."
