        "The purpose of this study was to determine the psychological characteristics of people who show a paradoxical increase in anxiety during relaxation training. Thirty-eight subjects who reported being anxious 50% or more of the day, were divided into two groups based on their scores on the Tellegen and Atkinson absorption scale. Half of each group was given progressive muscle relaxation training; the other half a meditational procedure. Separate regression analyses for each group showed that during meditational procedure 32% of the change in heart rate and 42% of the change in a subjective response measured by changes in the position of an \"anxiety lever\", could be predicted by the subjects' scores on the Tellegen absorption scale, the cognitive component of the state version of the Cognitive-Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire, and other psychological tests. Similarly, 49% of the heart rate changes during progressive muscle relaxation training were predicted by these and other measures. The multiple R for anxiety lever during progressive muscle relaxation training was not significant, however. Three of 18 meditational procedure subjects and two of 20 progressive muscle relaxation subjects showed increased heart rates during relaxation training. Two of the three meditational procedure subjects also showed an increase in subjective tension as measured by the anxiety lever."
