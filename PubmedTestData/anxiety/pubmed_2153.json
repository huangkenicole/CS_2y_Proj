        "The present study sought to determine the prevalence of emotional distress and evaluate demographic and clinical factors related to anxiety and depression in treatment-na\u00efve cancer patients at the beginning of chemotherapy. Another objective was to explore the associations between emotional distress and quality of life (QoL), an endpoint of great importance in current cancer care.",
        "Adult outpatients with a variety of cancer diagnoses were administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQC30) questionnaire prior to the initiation of treatment.",
        "A total of 265 patients took part in the study. A sizeable minority of our patients reported intense levels of anxiety (27.2%) and depression (19.6%). Patients without a partner, females, and patients with advanced disease or lower physician-rated performance status (PS) were more likely to experience clinically significant emotional distress. Levels of anxiety and mainly depression were negatively related to all QoL domains.",
        "Our results indicate that a significant proportion of Greek cancer patients experience intense anxiety and depression prior to chemotherapy, and confirm the adverse impact of psychological morbidity on patients' QoL. Standardized and timely screening of emotional distress across all phases of cancer will help to effectively identify patients whose symptoms warrant attention. Future studies should continue to develop and evaluate rapid measures for detecting significant emotional distress in cancer patients, and to devise appropriate interventions to treat distress and enhance patients' QoL."
