        "To assess the effect of cancer patients' attachment patterns on their satisfaction of medical care.",
        "This was a cross-sectional design study performed in an outpatient palliative care clinic. The sample consisted of 100 cancer patients. Participants completed the Greek versions of patients' satisfaction, and attachment orientation to close others (Family, Close Friends, Medical Care Providers).",
        "\"Information/interaction with health-care professionals\" subscale positively correlated with \"disease duration\". \"Availability of care\" subscale was negatively correlated with \"discomfort with closeness\", \"anxiety\", and \"avoidance\". \"Information/interaction with health-care professionals\" positively correlated with \"metastasis\", \"chemotherapy\", and \"hormonotherapy\", while \"availability of care\" had positive correlations with \"education\", \"chemotherapy\", and \"hormonotherapy\". Multiple regression model showed that \"discomfort with closeness\" was associated with \"information/interaction with health-care professionals\". Similarly, \"chemotherapy\" and \"surgery\" were positively associated with \"information/interaction with health-care professionals\". Disease duration was associated with increased satisfaction with \"information/interaction with health-care professionals\". Predictors of \"availability of care\" were \"discomfort with closeness\", \"education\", and \"avoidance\".",
        "\"Chemotherapy\", \"surgery\" and \"discomfort with closeness\" predicted low satisfaction with \"information/interaction with health-care professionals\", while \"discomfort with closeness\" and \"avoidance\" predicted low satisfaction with \"availability of care\" and at the same time a high level of \"education\" predicted patients' satisfaction with \"availability of care\"."
