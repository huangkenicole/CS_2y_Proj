        "<b>Background:</b> Assessing and managing patient anxiety is essential to reduce postoperative complications in elderly patients. However, monitoring patient anxiety objectively is impossible. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the level of fNIRS signals and anxiety in patients aged 65 and older undergoing artificial joint replacement surgery. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Sixty patients aged \u226565 years scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were included. To differentiate the degree of anxiety, the patients were randomly divided into three groups, each consisting of 20 patients (group 1: administered normal saline as a placebo; groups 2 and 3: administered dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.2 and 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/h, respectively, for 10 min). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was measured continuously for 10 min in each session (session 1: pre-anesthetic period; session 2: immediately after the spinal anesthesia period; session 3: normal saline or dexmedetomidine receiving period) in all patients. Vital signs were measured thrice at 5-min intervals during each session. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -S (STAI-S) and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) scores were assessed at the end of each session. <b>Results:</b> The STAI-S score was significantly correlated with power of bandwidth (<i>p</i> = 0.034). In addition, the RSS score was significantly correlated with BW 1, 2, and 3 (<i>p</i> = 0.010, <i>p</i> < 0.001, and <i>p</i> = 0.003, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> The STAI-S score and BW 3 were significantly correlated, suggesting that fNIRS might help objectively and directly monitor anxiety levels."
