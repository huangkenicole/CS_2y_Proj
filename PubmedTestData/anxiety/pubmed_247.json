        "To explore the effect of emotion management ability on the social anxiety and aggressive behavior among 4 - 6 grade pupils.",

The questionnaire contents included general condition, emotion management ability, aggressive behavior and social anxiety, and the relationships of which were analyzed using partial correlation and hierarchical regression method.",
        "The score of aggressive behavior in boys (72. 74 \u00b1 18. 09) was higher than that in girls (66. 31 \u00b1 17. 53) (P < 0. 01), and the aggressive behaviors in grade five students (71. 76 \u00b1 18. 06) were higher than that in grade four (69. 24 \u00b1 18. 95) and six students (68. 40 \u00b1 17. 19) (P <0. 05). When gender and grade variables, the aggressive behaviors were negatively correlated with emotion management ability (r = - 0. 463, P < 0. 01) , and were positively correlated with social anxiety (r = 0. 229, P < 0. 01) , and the emotion management ability was negatively correlated with social anxiety ( r = - 0. 234, P < 0. 01). Emotion management ability played the mediation and regulation roles on the social anxiety and aggressive behavior (P < 0. 01), which accounting for 46. 08% and 3. 50% of the total effect, respectively",
