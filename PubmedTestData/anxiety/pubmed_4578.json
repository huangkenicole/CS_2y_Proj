        "Infertility, and fertility treatment, are associated with psychological distress that may influence subsequent mental health including postpartum depression and anxiety.",
        "Data for women who had a livebirth between 1991 and 2013 were drawn from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Conception history prior to their first recorded birth was categorised as 'no fertility problems', 'untreated subfertility', ovulation induction (OI), and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Depression and/or anxiety in the 12\u00a0months postpartum were identified using records of diagnoses, symptoms, and prescriptions. Prevalence was compared, and odds ratios estimated using multivariable logistic regression.",
        "Of 235,127 mothers, 31,947 (13.6%) had evidence of postpartum depression and/or anxiety. Mothers in the ART group had 22% lower odds of postnatal depression and/or anxiety compared to mothers in the fertile group (OR 0.78; 95% CI [0.70-0.86]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Accounting for prior mental health, lifestyle, sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors reduced the strength of the association (aOR 0.87; 95% CI [0.78-0.97]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). There were no significant associations observed in the untreated subfertility or OI groups.",
        "As in any analysis of routine data, the quality of recording is important and some information was unavailable (e.g. education, social support).",
        "Women with a history of subfertility, OI or ART treatment were not at increased risk of postpartum depression and/or anxiety compared to those with no fertility problems. It is important to explore whether women who underwent ART are less likely to experience depression/anxiety or do not seek help when needed, with implications for their health and care."
