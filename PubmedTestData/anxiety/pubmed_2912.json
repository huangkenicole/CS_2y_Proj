        "This study tested the efficacy of a pilot orientation program in reducing distress levels of patients with newly diagnosed cancer. Thirty-three consecutive patients were randomly assigned to an intervention or to a usual-care control group. The intervention group received a clinic tour, general information, and the opportunity to pose questions to an oncology counselor. The dependent variables were measured by the Profile of Mood States-Short Form-Total Mood Disturbance Scale and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Scores on the dependent measures were significantly lower in the intervention group. These results suggest that a simple orientation can greatly benefit patients with newly diagnosed cancer. The orientation may reduce anxiety and overall distress by helping patients manage novelty and unpredictability in the unfamiliar clinic setting. This intervention can be delivered within the context of a busy hematology/oncology outpatient clinic."
