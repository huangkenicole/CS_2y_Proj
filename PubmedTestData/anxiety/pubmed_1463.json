        "Pain anxiety and dysfunction are among the most prevalent complications of burns, impacting the quality of life (QOL) of patients with burn injuries. As a nonpharmaceutical approach, recreational therapy can be effective in reducing the complications of burns. This study aimed to examine the effect of a recreational therapy program on the pain anxiety and QOL of patients with burn injuries. This controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted on 58 patients admitted to the burn center of Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. These patients were randomly allocated to the intervention and control group. The intervention group received a recreational therapy program three sessions a week, for 2 weeks. The control group performed routine daily activities. As the main variable of the study, the Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale and Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief were completed for both groups before and 2 weeks after the intervention. After controlling confounders, the pain anxiety score in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group (P = .002). The total QOL score was significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group (P = .001). In addition, the intervention significantly increased the scores of QOL in the physical (P < .001), emotional (P = .009), and social (P < .001) dimensions. As it reduces pain anxiety and promotes the QOL of patients with burn injuries, this recreational therapy program is recommended for promoting the mental health and QOL of these patients."
