      "AbstractText": [
        "T-type calcium channels are low voltage activated calcium channels that are widely expressed in various brain regions including stress-responsive regions. These channels regulate the diverse functions of the central nervous system, and modulation of these channels is shown to modulate the anxiety. Studies have described that modulation of T-type calcium channels may either aggravate or ameliorate anxiety-related behavior, suggesting the dual role of these channels. The studies employing animals with overexpression of T-type calcium channels reported their anxiety-inducing role. Therefore, the blockade of these channels using various pharmacological agents such as ethosuximide, plant extracts of linalool or rosemary, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is reported to ameliorate anxiety. On the contrary, knockout of the gene encoding these channels predisposes the rodents to anxiety-related disorders, suggesting the anxiety-attenuating role of these channels. It may be possible that these channels in normal or basal state attenuate anxiety, whereas activation of these channels in stressful condition may produce anxiety. The present review describes the dual role of T-type calcium channels in anxiety-related behavior in both preclinical and clinical studies."
