        "The aim of our study was to gather information on how people with epilepsy (PwE) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic during the national lockdown. An online questionnaire was therefore offered to the visitors of the Croatian Association for Epilepsy's website. The 22-items questionnaire was designed to acquire information from adults with epilepsy living in Croatia on demographic data, cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic, and communication problems between patients and their neurologists during the lockdown. Perceived anxiety and fears were expressed with the Likert scale (1-5) and the results of specific fears added to make the Total Fear Score. Results: Out of 186 respondents in total, only 2.8% did not comply with the lockdown measures, and all of those respondents stated that they did not feel any anxiety related to COVID-19. A canceled neurologist examination during the lockdown was significantly associated with pandemic-related anxiety (2.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.28 vs. 2.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.19, U\u202f=\u202f3039, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and fears (Total Fear Score 31.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.70 vs. 28.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.79, U\u202f=\u202f3341, p\u202f=\u202f0.036), and 87.4% of respondents expressed the wish to communicate with their neurologist, either by phone/video call (53.0%) or email (34.4%). Conclusion: We think the results of our survey show that the responses from PwE point to a social responsibility appropriate for the existing situation. During future pandemics, telemedicine could have an important role in tackling the fears and anxieties caused by the cancelation of examinations, which corresponds to the wishes expressed by the great majority of our respondents."
