        "There is a need to synthesize available information on the emerging construct of cyberchondria to guide evidence informed practice. With this in mind, electronic search of databases including MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and Google scholar were carried out from inception till March 2020 to identify relevant English language peer reviewed articles related to cyberchondria. Generated abstracts were grouped according to their thematic focus and summarized. A total of 49 articles were reviewed. Articles directly evaluating cyberchondria were very few and most of the treatment evidence was extrapolated from trials on health anxiety. Cyberchondria appears to be a phenomenologically overlapping entity with, yet distinguishable from, health anxiety and there may be merit in studying the two constructs separately. Four validated self-assessment measures for cyberchondria are available in literature. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered either physically or through the internet (iCBT) have been found to be effective for both health anxiety and cyberchondria. Pharmacologic strategies for health anxiety have mainly involved the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, with mean effective dosages higher than for depression/anxiety. Prevention of cyberchondria needs to focus on appropriate harm reduction strategies as well as supply and demand side measures. Internet based CBT therapies hold promise for management of cyberchondria. This finding must be considered preliminary due to limited evidence. Further study is required to establish the diagnostic validity of cyberchondria."
