        "A pilot program to reduce test anxiety and related social-evaluative concerns is presented. Testbusters is a program designed specifically for elementary and middle school children in grades 4 through 7 that teaches effective study habits, study skills, and test-taking strategies and includes a behavioral contract to ensure consistent study behavior. The assessment strategy includes self-report instruments, a behavioral assessment, and children's grade point averages. After a 6-month waiting period, eight children with moderate to severe test anxiety participated in the 11-week program. The results indicated that Testbusters decreased general levels of test anxiety and self-ratings of distress when taking a test. Overall grade point average improved significantly and grades in the majority of the subjects showed positive improvement. There was no change in overall self-esteem or judgments of cognitive competence. The results are discussed in terms of the use of a skills strategy to decrease anxiety and improve academic achievement."
