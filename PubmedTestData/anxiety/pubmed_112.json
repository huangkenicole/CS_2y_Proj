        "Anxiety is an affective response commonly experienced by persons after emotional and physical trauma, as well as associated with aversive medical treatments. The scientific information related to the conceptualization, assessment, and treatment of anxiety is limited. In order to develop a pilot protocol for anxiety management, nursing directors at 64 burn centers were surveyed. At 89% of the centers, anxiety measures were not used. Most of the teams assess informally through observation of patient (n=21), dialogue with patient (n=12), or both observation and dialogue with patient (n=15). Assessors of anxiety range in breadth from nurse only to the entire burn team, including pastoral care representatives and family. The class of medication most frequently endorsed in treating anxiety is the benzodiazipine, most often lorazepam (Ativan). A number of non-pharmacologic techniques are used to manage anxiety, e.g., muscle relaxation, breathing, imagery. Consideration should be given to assessing anxiety systematically, so knowledge can be gleaned and applied to conceptualization of symptom presentation and application of treatment resources."
