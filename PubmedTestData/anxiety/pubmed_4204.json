        "The aims of this study were to: 1) estimate the prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high impact chronic pain (HICP) in a community sample of children and adolescents; and 2) compare groups (those without CP, those with CP but no HICP, and those with HICP) with respect to demographic variables, pain variables, and physical, psychological, and school-related function. One thousand one hundred and fifteen children and adolescents participated (56% girls; age: \u07c2\u00a0=\u00a011.67; SD\u00a0=\u00a02.47; range\u00a0=\u00a08-18 years). The prevalence of CP and HICP was 46% and 5%, respectively, and was higher in girls and increased with age. Participants with HICP reported greater pain intensity and higher pain frequency than those with CP but no HICP. In addition, participants with HICP reported lower mobility, greater fatigue, worst sleep quality, more anxiety and depression symptoms, worst cognitive function, missing more school days, and worse perceived school performance. HICP is a prevalent condition in children and adolescents and is associated with many negative consequences. Stakeholders must be aware of this and ensure that treatment programs are available to reduce the individual and societal impact of HICP in young individuals. PERSPECTIVE: This article provides information on CP and HICP prevalence and impact in children and adolescents. By better understanding the nature and score of these conditions, we will be able to develop more effective early interventions to help this population and thereby reduce their long-term negative impact."
