        "Hypertension is a serious medical condition, the frequency of which increases significantly with age; has a negative impact on certain health complications; and increases the rate of mortality. Music therapy as a nonpharmacological treatment has many positive effects on an individual's body and mind. A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate the effects of music therapy on blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety levels in older adults with hypertension living in a nursing home. Sixty older adults were randomly divided into experimental and control groups (<i>n</i> = 30 each). Significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety levels were found in older adults with hypertension receiving music therapy compared with the control group. The current study confirms music therapy as a safe, noninvasive, nonpharmacological, and cost-effective intervention for reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety levels in older adults with hypertension.
