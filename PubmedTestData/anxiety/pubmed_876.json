        "Due to the high incidence of postpartum anxiety disorders and their serious health and social consequences, it is essential to analyze the possible risk factors to identify groups of women particularly vulnerable to cover their proper care and control. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between the anxiety in women in the postpartum period, and their living conditions and lifestyle.",
        "The study was conducted from April to July 2016. We included 102 women in the postpartum period, living in the city of Cracow and the Cracow district. The study was based on a survey of our own authorship, State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Jurczy\u0144ski\u2019s Inventory of Health Behavior (IZZ).",
        "The anxiety level in women in the postpartum period depends on the conditions of life and health behaviors. The level of health behavior of women in the postpartum period is an average and independent of age, number of children, and the material situation. Residents of cities, women with higher education, who planned pregnancy, have a higher level of health behavior. Good housing conditions have a positive influence on health behavior. Low levels of health behavior significantly affect the severity of maternal anxiety. Residents of the village, women with lower education and who not planning pregnancy have higher levels of anxiety during the postpartum period. Anxiety level of women in the postpartum period is inversely proportional to their housing conditions. Women with a job have lower levels of anxiety than non-working. The anxiety level in women in childbirth does not depend on age or financial situation.",
        "The anxiety level in women in the postpartum period, significantly depends on the living conditions and health behaviors. Verification of distinguished factors should be applied appropriately in health promotional activities and prevention programs."
