        "Vaccination is one of the most significant public health interventions responsible for saving millions of lives and preventing significant morbidity. Despite this, there remain concerns about a number of vaccines. Although vaccines are extensively tested, there are genuine questions that many parents have about a number of vaccine-related issues. It is important that practitioners can discuss these concerns because denying or dismissing them may lead parents and patients to seek advice from uninformed sources. This article discusses some of the major concerns about vaccines, including their safety, immunogenicity, and the development of national immunization programs. It concludes that although vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, constant vigilance is required."
