        "There is a growing realisation that anxiety symptoms and disorders during pregnancy are associated with various negative outcomes. The aims of this study were to identify latent classes of anxiety symptom trajectories during pregnancy, compare anxiety levels between pregnancy trimesters and ascertain the predictors of anxiety symptom trajectories.",
        "Two hundred pregnant women in their first trimester who attended obstetric clinics at the local hospital were recruited. Three self-report questionnaires assessing anxiety levels were administered at three time points during pregnancy. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify anxiety symptom trajectories, and logistic regression analysis was performed to ascertain the predictors of latent class membership.",
        "Data for analyses were available for 188 women. Two anxiety symptom trajectories were identified: a 'high-anxiety' trajectory (13.3% of participating women) and 'low-anxiety' trajectory (86.7%). This finding was consistent across all the anxiety measures used in the study. Overall, anxiety levels gradually decreased during pregnancy, with a significant decrease between the first and second trimesters on some measures. Past mental disorders and significant stressors in the preceding 6 months predicted membership in the 'high-anxiety' trajectory group.",
        "These findings support an early assessment of anxiety in pregnant women. If untreated, a high level of anxiety in the first trimester is likely to persist throughout pregnancy, although it may decrease somewhat. An early recognition of pathological anxiety during pregnancy allows its timely treatment and prevention of unfavourable outcomes."
