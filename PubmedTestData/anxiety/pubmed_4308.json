        "The aim of the study was to examine the mental well-being of audiologists in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, between 23 June and 13 August 2020. A self-report survey included screening measures for psychological distress (PHQ-4: anxiety and depression) and loneliness (UCLA-3).",
        "239 audiologists from around the world.",
        "The prevalence of psychological distress was 12.1% (subscales for anxiety 16.3% and depression 10.4%), and loneliness 32.2%. Depression and loneliness were higher in those participants self-reporting perceived job insecurity, with psychological distress (anxiety and depression) higher in those from South Africa. Accessibility to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) appears to be a protective factor.",
        "Well-being interventions, such as EAPS, are needed to support audiologists during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic."
