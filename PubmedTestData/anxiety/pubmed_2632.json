        "The literature on racism and anxiety-related disorders, especially social anxiety, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder, is notably lacking. This report aims to review recent evidence demonstrating the link between racial discrimination and various anxiety-related disorders.",
        "Anxiety-related disorders were the most significant mediator for daily discrimination and suicidal thoughts, above both depression and substance use. Further, studies showed that racial discrimination promotes posttraumatic stress and racial trauma among people of color. Systemic racism puts people of color at a higher risk for anxiety disorders than White people. Clinical case examples provide lived evidence of diverse racial and ethnic individuals suffering from anxiety-related disorders, with the development and worsening of symptoms due to racism and microaggressions. There is a prominent need for recent research on anxiety-related disorders and racism. Recommendations for clinicians and future research directions are provided. These actions are required to address bias and mental health inequities and empower people of color."
