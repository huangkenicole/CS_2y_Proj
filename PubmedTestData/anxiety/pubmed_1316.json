        "In early hypertension, weak anxiety and subclinical emotional disturbances, dominant was a parasympathetic trend of the vegetative tone without central control of the cardiac rhythm in hyperkinetic circulation. Changes in cortical neurodynamics manifested with minor attenuation of the ability to focus attention. Progression of angiospasticity and anxiety gave rise to psychic maladjustment in the form of anxiety-depression disorders with autonomic dysfunction in hypokinetic circulation, overcentralization of cardiac rhythm control. This was associated with a decline in mental performance.",
