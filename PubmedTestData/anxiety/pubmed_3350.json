        "Comorbid anxiety disorder is related to greater illness severity among individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, but its potential role in moderating response to Family Focused Therapy (FFT) for CHR is unexamined. We investigated whether comorbid anxiety disorder in CHR individuals is associated with less constructive communication during family problem-solving interactions, whether their communication skills differentially improve after FFT, and whether FFT is effective in reducing anxiety in this population.",
        "Individuals recruited into the second phase of the 8-site North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS2) participated (N\u2009=\u2009129). They were randomly assigned to 18-sessions of FFT-CHR or three-sessions of Enhanced Care (EC). Participants completed a diagnostic interview at pre-treatment, a family interaction task at pre-treatment and 6-months, and a self-report anxiety measure at pretreatment, 6 and 12-months.",
        "Individuals at CHR with comorbid anxiety engaged in more negative and\u00a0fewer positive behaviours during family problem-solving interactions at pre-treatment than did those without comorbid anxiety. There was a significant interaction between anxiety diagnosis and time on interactional behaviour scores, such\u00a0that individuals at CHR with an anxiety diagnosis showed a greater decrease in negative behaviours and increase in positive behaviours from baseline to 6-months than those without anxiety disorder(s) regardless of treatment condition. However, individuals' self-reported anxiety symptoms decreased more in FFT-CHR than in EC from pre-treatment to 12-month follow-up, regardless of anxiety diagnoses.",
        "Individuals at CHR with symptoms of anxiety benefit from family interventions in showing reductions in anxiety and improvements in family communication."
