        "Preoperative anxiety is prevalent and has harmful effects on postoperative outcomes. However, to date, it is still unclear (i) to what extent patients perceive preoperative anxiety as emotionally distressful, (ii) whether patients would welcome support from anesthesiologists in coping with their anxiety, and (iii) whether anxiety scores are useful for everyday clinical practice to determine patients' need for support.",
        "1082 patients scheduled to undergo elective procedures under general anesthesia were eligible for this cross-sectional study carried out at a university hospital. Preoperative anxiety, resulting in emotional distress, and patients' desire for anesthesiologists' support in coping with their anxiety were assessed dichotomously (no vs. yes) and analyzed descriptively. The intensity of anxiety was evaluated using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (range 4-20). Associations between the intensity of anxiety and the resulting desire for support were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to identify anxiety levels that best predict desire for support.",
        "Among the 1000 (537 female; M (SD) 57 (18) years) subjects evaluated, 493 (318 (65\u2009%) female) reported anxiety. Anxiety was associated with emotional distress in 320 (65\u2009%) and desire for support in 291 (59\u2009%) patients. Increased preoperative anxiety levels were associated with higher rates of desire for support (B=\u20090.270; odds ratio 1.31 [95\u2009% CI 1.22-1.41]). An anxiety score\u2009>\u20099 was best to predict a desire for support (sensitivity 0.861, specificity 0.724). However, desire for support was even present in some patients with lowest anxiety scores (5 or 6).",
        "All patients undergoing surgery should be screened for preoperative anxiety and the resulting desire for support to be able to determine who would welcome support. Anxiety scoring tools do not seem to be useful to identify these patients. By helping patients experience less preoperative anxiety, anesthesiologists may not only reduce patients' emotional distress but also have a positive impact on postoperative outcome.",
