        "This study investigated the association between parental perfectionism and students' test anxiety, as measured on self-report questionnaires. A random sample of 90 students in their last two years of secondary schooling and their parents (81 mothers, 76 fathers), with approximately equal numbers of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, were included. A significant contribution to anxiety associated with an examination was by maternal perfectionistic attitudes. Girls had higher scores on Test Anxiety than boys. The results are discussed in terms of the relationship of Test Anxiety to family variables, and directions for research are indicated."
