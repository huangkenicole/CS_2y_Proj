        "This study was aimed to examine the effectiveness of a newly developed therapeutic method focusing on affective and sensory processes in the treatment of sleep problems in outpatients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), called the 'Affective and Sensory Psychotherapy Module' (ASPM).",
        "A randomised controlled trial was conducted, there were 60 outpatient participants. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used at baseline, post-treatment, and 3 month follow-up.",
        "There were no significant differences between the therapeutic and control groups at baseline. The therapeutic group showed a significant improvement in sleep quality and anxiety decrease compared to the control group. Sex differences did not occur in the results for within-subjects and between-group effects in this study.",
        "The present study supported the efficacy of ASPM in the treatment of sleep problems in adult outpatients with GAD."
