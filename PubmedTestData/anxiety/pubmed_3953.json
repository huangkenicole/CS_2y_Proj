        "Previous factor studies of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970) have reported certain typical factors that are state-trait (S-T) 2-factor solutions and positively-negatively (P-N) worded item 2-factor solutions in addition to 4-factor solutions (positively and negatively worded state factors, positively and negatively worded trait factors). We explored the possibility that these factor structures are included in a factor space. Responses to the Japanese version of the STAI in a sample of 848 male workers were factor analyzed. The first-order factors obtained from principal-component analysis were almost equal to the previous 4 factors, except for a minor factor, and their second-order factors were the P-N factors. However, the S-T factors were also obtained from the same first-order factors by the oblique Procrustes rotation. Moreover, coexistence of these two 2-factor structures was determined in the same factor space by the orthogonal Procrustes rotation."
