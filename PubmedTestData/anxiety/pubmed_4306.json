        "Acculturative stress in relation to anxiety symptoms has not been examined empirically in young Hispanic populations. The present study, conducted with 138 pre-adolescent Hispanic youngsters, investigated this relationship. The findings suggested that acculturative stress was related to physiological, concentration, and worrisome symptoms of anxiety. After decomposing acculturative stress, it became evident that perceived discrimination accounted for a large proportion of the variance in the relationship between acculturative stress and anxiety. Immigration-related stress was mostly associated with worry symptoms. Finally, total daily hassles were an independent predictor of concentration and physiological anxiety symptoms. Implications for prevention interventions and future research are discussed."
