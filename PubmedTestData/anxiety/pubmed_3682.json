        "Few online interventions targeting anxiety and depression in university students are designed for universal delivery, and none for group-level delivery. This randomized controlled trial (NCT No. 04361045) examined the effectiveness of such a prevention program.",
        "StriveWeekly is a web-based intervention designed with weekly self-guided skill modules (e.g., behavioral activation) that are synchronously delivered to all users. Student participants (<i>n</i> = 1,607) were recruited from one large public university, and 65.4% had no prior mental health service use. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of StriveWeekly (<i>n</i> = 804) or a waitlist condition (<i>n</i> = 803). Participants completed web-based surveys at baseline, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the self-reported Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21.",
        "Piecewise linear mixed-effect models found significant group by time interactions for depression (<i>t</i> = -3.05, <i>p</i> = .002), anxiety (<i>t</i> = -3.01, <i>p</i> = .003), and total symptoms (<i>t</i> = -3.34, <i>p</i> < .001). Relative to the waitlist, students assigned to StriveWeekly improved more from baseline to posttest (between-group <i>d</i> = 0.18-0.21). These small effects were maintained through follow-up, and subsequently replicated by the original waitlist. The intervention was initiated by 73.0% of students in the StriveWeekly condition (modules completed: <i>M</i> = 3.72), and 71.6% of all posttest respondents rated the intervention highly.",
        "Findings supported StriveWeekly's effectiveness for large scale indicated prevention of anxiety and depression symptoms in university students. However, further development and research are still needed, as not all students used the intervention, reported satisfaction, or experienced improvement.
