        "The aim of the study was to explore social anxiety spectrum gender differences, in a sample of university students.",
        "Overall, 823 University of Pisa students were assessed by Social Anxiety Spectrum Self-Report Questionnaire (SHYSR). Using a total score of 68 as the optimal diagnostic threshold, we classified students into two groups with levels of severity: low scorers (<68 items) and high scorers (\u226568 items).",
        "Among females there was a significant higher rate of high scorers than males (32.5% vs 25.3%). Among the 13 most endorsed items (>60%), significant gender differences emerged for 6 items: females reported higher rates of items related to \u201cPerformance fears\u201d, that seemed to confirm the new DSM-5 specifier named \u201cPerformance only\u201d, while males reported higher rate in a single item related to \u201cBehavioural inhibition\u201d. Females showed a significant higher total score and \u201cSpecific anxieties and phobic features\u201d and \u201cInterpersonal sensitivity\u201d domain scores compared to males, in low severity subgroup, and males showed significant higher \u201cSocial phobic traits during childhood and adolescence\u201d and \u201cBehavioural inhibition and somatic symptoms\u201d domain scores compared to females in the high severity subgroup. Finally, rate of individuals declaring to consume alcohol was significantly higher in males than females.",
        "Among university students, social anxiety spectrum seems to be more frequent in females than males. In males, social anxiety spectrum is more frequently associated with an early onset, behavioural inhibition and somatic symptoms and, consequently, with higher severity."
