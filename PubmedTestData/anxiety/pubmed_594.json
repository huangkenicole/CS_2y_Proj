        "This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and to evaluate the psychometric measurement properties of instruments for postpartum anxiety using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments guidelines to identify the best available patient-reported outcome measure.",
        "We searched 4 databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science in July 2022) and included studies that evaluated at least 1 psychometric measurement property of a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument. The protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews under identifier CRD42021260004 and followed the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments guidelines for systematic reviews.",
        "Studies eligible for inclusion were those that assessed the performance of a patient-reported outcome measure for screening for postpartum\u00a0anxiety. We included studies in which the instruments were subjected to some form of psychometric property assessment in the postpartum maternal population, consisted of at least 2 questions, and were not subscales.",
        "This systematic review used the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines to identify the best patient-reported outcome measurement instrument for examining postpartum anxiety. A risk of bias assessment was performed, and a modified GRADE approach was used to assess the level of evidence with recommendations being made for the overall quality of each instrument.",
        "A total of 28 studies evaluating 13 instruments in 10,570 patients were included. Content validity was sufficient in 9 with 5 instruments receiving a class A recommendation (recommended for use). The Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale, Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale Research Short Form, Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale Research Short Form Covid, Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale-Persian, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory demonstrated adequate content validity and sufficient internal consistency. Nine instruments received a recommendation of class B (further research required). No instrument received a class C recommendation (not recommended for use).",
        "Five instruments received a class A recommendation, all with limitations, such as not being specific to the postpartum population, not assessing all domains, lacking generalizability, or evaluation of cross-cultural validity. There is currently no freely available instrument that assess all domains of postpartum anxiety. Future studies are needed to determine the optimum current instrument or to develop and validate a more specific measure for maternal postpartum anxiety."
