        "The present study focuses on exploring the prevalence and relationship of stigma, stress, anxiety, and depression among patients with epilepsy. This hospital-based study consisted of 200 patients diagnosed with epilepsy using a purposive sampling selected from the outpatient department of the Central Indian Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Dewada, Chhattisgarh, India. Patients were assessed through a sociodemographic datasheet, Stigma Scale of Epilepsy, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. The result of the study reveals that patient with epilepsy perceived 25% of high stigma 61.0% of stress, 55.0% of anxiety, and 47.5% of the extremely severe level depression. In regression analysis, overall perceived stigma strongly contributes 32.9% to the variance on stress, anxiety, and depression in epileptic patients. The present study helps mental health professionals to understand the problems faced by patients with epilepsy and to create awareness about the same in society so that patients diagnosed with epilepsy are not ostracized."
