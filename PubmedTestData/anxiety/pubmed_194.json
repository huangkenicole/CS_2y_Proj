        "We investigated the associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms in normal subjects and patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders, using the Japaneses version of Spielberger's STAI and the Zung SDS.",
        "The subjects for the present study were 60 normal subjects, 15 patients with anxiety disorders and, 12 patients with mood disorders meeting the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.",
        "1) Both the mean total state-anxiety (S-anxiety) and trait-anxiety (T-anxiety) scores were significantly higher in patients with anxiety disorders and mood disorders than in normal subjects. 2) The mean total SDS score was significantly higher in patients with anxiety disorders and mood disorders than in normal subjects. 3) In normal subjects, there were significant positive correlations between the total T- and S-anxiety scores and total SDS scores. 4) In patients with anxiety disorders, there were significant positive correlations between the total T- and S-anxiety scores and total SDS scores. 5) In patients with mood disorders, there were nonsignificant positive correlations between the total T- and S-anxiety scores and total SDS scores.",
        "Our results might provide support for the existence of common underlying mechanisms to anxiety and depression."
