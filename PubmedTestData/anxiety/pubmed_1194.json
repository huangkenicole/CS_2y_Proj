        "In this case study we describe a hypnobehavioral procedure used in the successful treatment of a 10 1/2-year-old boy who suffered from an adjustment disorder with academic inhibition, manifested by an anxiety reaction secondary to learning disabilities that affected his written-language output. Treatment consisted of three self-management techniques: self-monitoring and charting of conditions that preceded anxiety-related behaviors; self-hypnosis and a progressive-muscle-relaxation induction technique; and response-prevention training. The hypnobehavioral procedure decreased anxiety and increased written-language output. We discuss the results in relation to the specific benefits obtained by the preadolescent studied, the advantages of the hypnobehavioral procedure over previous methods to resolve anxiety, the role of self-hypnosis in problem resolution, and future research directions."
