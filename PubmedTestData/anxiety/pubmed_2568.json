        "There is growing interest in using personalized mental health care to treat disorders like depression and anxiety to improve treatment engagement and efficacy. This randomized controlled trial will compare a traditional symptom severity decision-making algorithm to a novel multivariate decision-making algorithm for triage to and adaptation of mental health care. The stratified levels of care include a self-guided online wellness program, coach-guided online cognitive behavioral therapy, and clinician-delivered psychotherapy with or without pharmacotherapy. The novel multivariate algorithm will be comprised of baseline (for triage and adaptation) and time-varying variables (for adaptation) in four areas: social determinants of mental health, early adversity and life stressors, predisposing, enabling, and need influences on health service use, and comprehensive mental health status. The overarching goal is to evaluate whether the multivariate algorithm improves adherence to treatment, symptoms, and functioning above and beyond the symptom-based algorithm.",
        "This trial will recruit a total of 1000 participants over the course of 5\u00a0years in the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Participants will be recruited from a highly diverse sample of community college students. For the symptom severity approach, initial triaging to level of care will be based on symptom severity, whereas for the multivariate approach, the triaging will be based on a comprehensive set of baseline measures. After the initial triaging, level of care will be adapted throughout the duration of the treatment, utilizing either symptom severity or multivariate statistical approaches. Participants will complete computerized assessments and self-report questionnaires at baseline and up to 40\u00a0weeks. The multivariate decision-making algorithm will be updated annually to improve predictive outcomes.",
        "Results will provide a comparison on the traditional symptom severity decision-making and the novel multivariate decision-making with respect to treatment adherence, symptom improvement, and functional recovery. Moreover, the developed multivariate decision-making algorithms may be used as a template in other community college settings. Ultimately, findings will inform the practice of level of care\u00a0triage and adaptation in psychological treatments, as well as the use of personalized mental health care broadly.",
