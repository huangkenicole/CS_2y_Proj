      "AbstractText": [
        "Achalasia is associated with reduced quality of life in affected patients but research regarding the psychological burden of achalasia in terms of depression and anxiety is scarce. The current study therefore aims to investigate rates of depression and anxiety in patients with achalasia in relation to prevalence rates in the general population and to examine the extent to which achalasia-related characteristics (time since diagnosis, symptom load, achalasia-related quality of life, treatment history) predict symptoms of depression and anxiety.",
        "Using validated screening instruments, rates of depression and anxiety were assessed in a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 993 patients with achalasia and compared to population controls stratified by age and sex. Associations between depression and anxiety and achalasia-related factors were explored using linear regression.",
        "Compared to population controls, screening rates of female patients with achalasia were between 3.04 (p = .004) and 7.87 (p < .001) times higher for depression and 3.10 (p < .001) times higher for anxiety, respectively. No significant differences were found for male patients with achalasia. Both achalasia-related quality of life and symptom load were independently related to impaired mental health.",
        "Women appear to be specifically affected by the psychological burden of achalasia, pointing to sex-specific or gendered experiences of the disease. In addition to symptom reduction, psychological support may prove beneficial for improving the well-being of patients with achalasia."
