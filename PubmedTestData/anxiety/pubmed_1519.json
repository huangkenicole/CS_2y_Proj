        "Anxiety is among the least studied features of schizophrenia, despite evidence of its significant impact on disease outcome. This work aims to investigate the anxiety construct in a sample of outpatients with schizophrenia, exploring the interplay of clinical, neurocognitive and social cognitive domains, as well as adverse childhood experiences and their relative contribute in determining anxiety. A forward stepwise regression model was performed on a sample of 68 outpatients with schizophrenia, to examine the predictive effect of different variables on anxiety. Predictors have been selected based on previous literature and include psychopathological, neurocognitive and social cognitive measures, as well as premorbid environmental factors. The analysis showed a significant contribution of childhood adverse experiences, followed by personal distress, while no significant effect was found for symptom's severity, nor global cognitive efficiency. The results show that anxiety is mainly determined by early environmental factors, as well as by socio-cognitive dimensions, such as personal distress. Data also suggest that anxiety can be considered as an independent construct, rather than as a mere epiphenomenon of the illness. The study has clinical implications as it highlights the importance of implementing both standardized assessments and group interventions specifically targeting anxiety in schizophrenia."
