      "AbstractText": [
        "Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has been identified as a transdiagnostic cognitive risk factor for a wide range of affective disorders, including conditions within the obsessive compulsive (OC) spectrum. A growing body of research has demonstrated that directly reducing AS leads to subsequent reductions of other psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, worry, and mood. To date, no study has examined the efficacy of a brief AS intervention on reducing OC and hoarding symptoms.",
        "Non-treatment seeking young adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0104; 83.7% female; 81.7% Caucasian) were selected for having elevated levels of AS, and were then randomized into a single-session, computer-assisted AS intervention or a control condition. OC and hoarding symptoms were assessed at post-treatment, as well as at one week and one month follow-ups.",
        "Results revealed that the intervention, but not the control condition, reduced OC symptoms across the post-intervention follow-up period. Mediation analysis demonstrated that changes in AS mediated changes in OC symptoms due to the intervention. In contrast, the intervention did not have a specific effect on reducing hoarding symptoms.",
        "These findings have important ramifications for understanding the relationship between AS and OC spectrum symptoms, and raise interesting treatment and prevention implications."
