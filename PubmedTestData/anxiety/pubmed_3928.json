        "Hypnosis is useful for diminishing distress during medical procedures. This study investigated the efficacy of virtually augmented self-hypnosis as an adjunctive non-pharmacological method for procedural pain and anxiety relief during endovascular interventions (EVI).",
        "We compared an immersive distraction experience (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04561596) featuring virtual reality (VR) using a head-mounted display versus treatment as usual (TAU). Patients followed the \"Aqua\" module (Oncomfort\u2122) consisting of a scuba dive and breathing exercises. They experienced a self-induced dissociative state similar to clinical hypnosis without direct intervention of a professional. Enrollment followed a 1:1 randomized open study (VR or TAU). Patients' feelings were evaluated just before and after the procedure, and 3\u00a0months following intervention. Anxiety was evaluated using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and pain (sensory, emotional, and memory) with a visual analogue scale (VAS).",
        "This study included 100 patients. Mean anxiety (pre-post) was significantly reduced within groups and between groups (difference of 4.2 points, p\u2009=\u20090.016). The percentage of responders to anxiety lowering were 76 and 46% for VR and TAU, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.004). The two groups did not significantly differ in mean sensory-intensity and affective emotional pain (pre-post) using VAS, in negative memories concerning remembered pain at 3\u00a0months (difference\u2009>\u20091 from immediate post-procedural reported pain intensity), mean procedural time, or the need for analgesic or sedative drugs.",
        "VR self-hypnosis has the potential to improve the management of patients' distress during radiological procedures. It is safe and effective for reducing anxiety during EVI."
