        "To assess the superiority of a music therapy intervention (Music) vs usual care (Control) in reducing the preoperative anxiety of patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with nononcologic indications.",
        "This was a 1:2 (Music vs Control) randomized controlled study.",
        "A teaching hospital.",
        "One hundred patients were available for the analysis: 30 and 70 in the Music and Control arms, respectively.",
        "Perioperative music therapy pathway in patients undergoing TLH for benign disease.",
        "Anxiety was evaluated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y Form (STAI-Y) at different time points: at baseline and during preoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative periods. Pathologic anxiety was defined as STAI-Y state >45. Postoperative pain was registered using the visual analog scale. Women in the Music arm experienced lower anxiety levels (median STAI-Y scores 38.0 vs 41.0; p\u202f=\u202f.002) during the preoperative period. STAI-Y scores did not vary significantly by intervention at each subsequent time point. A significant difference between the groups (Music vs Control) was found in the proportion of women with pathologic anxiety during the preoperative (16.7% vs 37.2%; p\u202f=\u202f.04) and early postoperative periods (0% vs 12.9%; p\u202f=\u202f.04), whereas no significant difference between the groups was registered during the late postoperative period (6.6% vs 7.1%; p\u202f=\u202f.93). Postoperative pain intensity did not significantly differ between the groups at 1, 3, and 6 hours after surgery.",
        "Music therapy might be a viable complementary modality to usual surgical care in the gynecologic setting for its ability to significantly decrease preoperative anxiety in women undergoing TLH for benign conditions."
