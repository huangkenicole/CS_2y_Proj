        "Over the past years, international treatment guidelines have been established for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, little is known as to whether the actual inpatient treatment follows these guidelines. The main goal of this study was to answer the question whether patients with anxiety disorder are treated according to treatment guidelines. A total of 2,573 psychiatric inpatients with the diagnosis of anxiety disorder (920 men, 1,653 women) were identified on the basis of the data of the international drug safety programme in psychiatry AMSP. Of these patients, 25.3% presented with phobia, 26.6% with panic disorder, 18.7% with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 29.4% with other diagnoses of anxiety. In all of the patients, 12.7% did not receive any psychotropic medication and 22.9% were not treated with antidepressants. Only 59.3% of patients with GAD, 73.9% of patients with panic disorder, and 52.1% of patients with phobia were treated according to diagnostic guidelines. The majority (60.3%) of all patients received one or two psychotropic drugs, and only 3.7% received five or more psychotropic drugs. In two groups of patients (one group with phobia and one with panic disorder), the annual prescription rate of antidepressants significantly increased over time. The prescription rate for anticonvulsants in patients with GAD increased from 0% in 1997 to 41.7% in 2011, and for antipsychotics, from 40.7% in 1997 to 47.2% in 2011. In particular, patients with GAD were commonly treated with antipsychotics."
