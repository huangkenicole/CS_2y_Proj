        "To explore the relationship between prenatal anxiety and cesarean section (c-section) with non-medical indication.",
        "Nested case-control study was used to analyze the risk factors for c-section with no medical needs: 433 pregnant women with gestational age longer than 24 weeks were enrolled in this study. According to the mode of delivery, we divided them into a vaginal delivery group, a c-section group without medical need and a c-section group with medical need.",
        "The c-section rate was 62.1%, 55.8% of which was c-section without medical need at family request. The score of state anxiety (S-AI) and trait anxiety (T-AI) was 42.53\u00b111.04 and 44.40\u00b110.23 respectively, much higher than that of normal population. After the adjustment of maternal social economic status and other prenatal statuses for this pregnancy, the prenatal anxiety was still associated with c-section with non-medical indication. The adjusted odd ratio for prenatal anxiety state, prenatal trait anxiety state and c-section with non-medical indication was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.06-1.87) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.08-1.40), respectively.",
