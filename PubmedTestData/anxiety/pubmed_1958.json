        "Dementia-related anxiety (DRA) is the concern about current or future cognitive decline and potential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD). Existing research suggests that DRA likely develops due to diverse reasons (e.g., family ADRD history, self-perceived risk, and health-related anxiety), and approaches to managing DRA likely differ as well (e.g., future planning). This study aimed to identify profiles in DRA.",
        "In a cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of U.S. adults ranging in age from 18 to 82 (N = 492, Mage = 49.25, standard deviation [SDage] = 15.43) completed online assessments of characteristics associated with DRA. Latent profile analysis was used to uncover distinct DRA profiles and promote understanding of individual characteristics associated with varying levels of DRA; multinomial regression assessed if the profiles are further distinguished by covariates.",
        "The resulting four-profile model reveals profile differences are largely due to DRA, self-perceived ADRD risk, and preparedness for future care needs; health-related anxiety, age, ADRD exposure, and anticipated ADRD stigma contribute to profile differences as well. Profiles of the youngest and oldest groups reported the lowest and highest levels of preparedness for future care, along with the lowest DRA and self-perceived risk. Several covariates, particularly those assessing general psychological functioning, were also related to profile membership.",
        "The resulting profiles point to several factors associated with elevated anxiety about ADRD, which do not fully match the risk factors for ADRD."
