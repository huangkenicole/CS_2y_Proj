        "The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of two brief versions of previously validated cognitive process measures in insomnia: the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire and the Sleep-Associated Monitoring Index.",
        "Two samples (168 students and 219 patients with insomnia disorder) completed original and brief versions of the two measures (Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire-Brief version and Sleep-Associated Monitoring Index-Brief version). Also, they filled out sociodemographic questions, sleep items, and the Insomnia Severity Index.",
        "In both samples, the internal consistencies of the two brief versions were acceptable at \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.70 to.72. The correlations between the original and brief versions were significant at .79 to .82. The two brief versions were also significantly associated with insomnia severity and nighttime symptomatology. In the student sample, those with likely insomnia disorder (14.9% of the sample) scored significantly higher on the two brief versions, relative to those without insomnia.",
        "The two brief versions, Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire-Brief version and Sleep-Associated Monitoring Index-Brief version, displayed acceptable psychometric properties. This implies that the two brief versions might be viable alternatives for use in clinical and research settings."
