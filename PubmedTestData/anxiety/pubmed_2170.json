        "Anxiety may play a role in the initiation of smoking and there is evidence to suggest that sex and age may predetermine responses to nicotine. At present, the greatest increase in smoking is in women and it is often accompanied by dieting. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how the impact of dietary restriction might modify the effects of nicotine in female adult and adolescent rats. The effects of nicotine in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety were compared in free-feeding animals and those subjected to dietary restriction that reduced body weight to 85% of free-feeding weight. In nondeprived adult females, nicotine (0.05-0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the percentage of time spent on the open arms, indicating anxiogenic effects. However, the effects of nicotine were dramatically changed in food-restricted adult females and 0.05 mg/kg had a striking anxiolytic effect. No significant effects of nicotine were found in the adolescent female rats, suggesting a role of circulating sex hormones in modulating nicotine's effects on anxiety. However, in the adolescent females, dietary restriction significantly increased the percentages of time spent and entries onto the open arms, without changing closed arm entries, indicating an anxiolytic effect. These results raise the important possibility that, in prepubertal girls, dietary restriction may have anxiolytic effects and this might contribute to the onset of anorexia. Circulating female hormones reduce this effect, but in adult females the combination of dietary restriction and nicotine may have important anxiolytic effects that impact on the initiation of regular smoking."
