        "Having revised Daly and Miller's 1975 unidimensional Writing Apprehension Test, Riffe and Stacks in 1992 proposed eight multidimensional factors derived from responses to 56 items in their Mass Communication Writing Apprehension Measure, administered to communication students to identify the various dimensions of apprehension about writing shared with business writers and specific to their major. The current authors administered the questionnaire at the beginning of an academic year to 419 freshmen from all undergraduate schools and majors at a private liberal arts university. It was hypothesized that the factors found among the homogeneous population of communication majors would not be replicated among the more heterogeneous student population. The hypothesis was partially upheld. Seven factors were identified. Two duplicated most items found by Riffe and Stacks (1992), four added items, and one was new. The results of this study suggest that, although the general population of students differs from students in mass communication, as Riffe and Stacks remarked, the groups also share similar content in their writing apprehension, that writing apprehension is multidimensional, that caution must be exercised when administering any instrument for the diagnostic and counseling purposes suggested by Riffe and Stacks, and that writing apprehension should also be investigated from the perspective of locus of control."
