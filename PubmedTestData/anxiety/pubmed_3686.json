        "To analyze somatic and psychological factors affecting the outcomes of in-hospital vestibular rehabilitation in patients with intractable dizziness.",
        "The study involved 138 patients with persistent dizziness caused by peripheral vestibular dysfunction. They were hospitalized and taught to conduct a vestibular rehabilitation program for 30\u200aminutes by themselves three times a day over 5 days. They were then instructed to continue performing the program every day after discharge. Several questionnaires were conducted immediately before, and 1 month after, the treatment. For example, the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), the somatosensory catastrophizing scale (SSCS), and indexes of depression and anxiety. Posturography was also performed. The main outcome was the difference between the DHI scores before and after rehabilitation. Body sway was objectively evaluated using static posturography.",
        "The vestibular rehabilitation significantly improved the DHI score, the SSCS score, depression, and anxiety. Multivariate analysis indicated that the improvement in the DHI score was poorer in patients who showed high SSCS score before intervention. A higher prevalue of the DHI was associated with greater improvements in this perceived handicap after the rehabilitation. Small body sway pre-rehabilitation was related to positive effects on the DHI score in patients with a high prevalue of the DHI.",
        "The vestibular rehabilitation contributed to the improvement of perceived handicap due to dizziness, catastrophization of bodily sensation, and emotional distress. Patients who catastrophized their bodily sensations before vestibular rehabilitation saw smaller improvements in perceived handicap due to dizziness."
