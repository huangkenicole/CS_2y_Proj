        "patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have a high rate of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.",
        "the main goal of this study was to design, to put into practice, and to validate a protocolized psychological treatment program based on the coping model, and a psycho-educational methodology in which the following intervention modules were included- illness information, coping model, problem solving techniques, relaxation, social skill training, distraction, and cognitive restructuring techniques. All these techniques were adapted to the characteristic features of inflammatory bowel disease.",
        "the sample included 57 patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the Spanish Crohn s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Association. The sample was randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups -33 were assigned to the treatment group, and 24 were assigned to the waiting list control group.",
        "the results reflected a significant clinical and statistical improvement in anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.001) variables when compared to the waiting list control group. Likewise, improvement was sustained at 3, 6, and 12 months during follow-up.",
        "the protocolized psychological treatment program, administered in group sessions, is effective in reducing emotional symptoms arising as a result of inflammatory bowel disease."
