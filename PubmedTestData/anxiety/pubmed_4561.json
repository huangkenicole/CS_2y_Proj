        "Androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss in both males and females. In a society that places significant value on hair and associates it with attractiveness, a lack there of can have damaging psychological consequences. The psychosocial impact of hair loss is often overlooked due to the medically benign nature of offending conditions. Addressing the psychological aspects of androgenetic alopecia can improve holistic patient care and patient outcomes.",
        "A search was conducted in PubMed using the following search strategy: androgenetic alopecia AND anxiety OR depression OR psychological OR psychosocial OR self-esteem. Studies were excluded if they focused on any other type of alopecia or were published in a language other than English.",
        "A total of 13 studies were retained after the initial search process. The included studies date from 1992 to 2021. They all conclude that androgenetic alopecia serves as a significant psychosocial stressor in the lives of those affected. It impairs quality of life according to multiple measures.",
        "The data examined from these studies shed light on the increased need to attend to the psychosocial comorbidity associated with androgenetic alopecia. These hair-loss patients often present to dermatology clinics to seek treatment but would also benefit from psychological support."
