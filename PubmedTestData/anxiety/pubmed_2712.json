        "Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a common form of scoliosis, causing rotational deformity of the torso in a teenage population. In AIS this happens at a time of particular psychological development and vulnerability and a link between AIS and mental health problems has been observed.",
        "Over a 6 month period, all patients with AIS aged 10-18 referred to a single spinal deformity centre in the UK were screened for symptoms suggestive of a potential diagnosis of depression and social anxiety.",
        "Of the 33 patients surveyed, 6 (18%) had scores worthy of further assessment for a potential diagnosis of depression and 19 (59%) worthy of further assessment for a potential diagnosis of social anxiety.",
        "This small study supports the notion that there is an association between AIS and mental health issues. These initial findings support the practice of routine mental health screening in AIS."
