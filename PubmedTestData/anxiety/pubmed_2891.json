        "High costs, long wait times, and lack of access to mental health supports in Ontario are leaving millions with unmet treatment needs. To address this need, Ontario launched BounceBack, a large-scale coach-supported intervention grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to target symptoms of anxiety, depression, and functional impairment. The objective of this program evaluation was to examine the effectiveness of the BounceBack program in Ontario by exploring (a) changes in participants' depression and anxiety symptoms and functional impairment (as measured by the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS, respectively); and (b) rates for recovery and reliable improvement. Multilevel modelling (MLM) results indicated that participants reported significant improvements in their depression, anxiety, and functioning symptoms over time, which are not better accounted for by other demographic factors. Higher baseline severity of symptoms were associated with greater decreases in these symptoms. The strong recovery and reliable improvement rates identified further support the effectiveness of BounceBack as a potent intervention that leads to improvements in symptoms of anxiety and/or depression for the majority of its participants."
