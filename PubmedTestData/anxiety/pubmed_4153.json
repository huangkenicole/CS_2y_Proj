        "Social support can positively influence both physical and psychological recovery from sport-related injury. However, few studies have examined the influence of the quantity, quality, and timing of social support on athletes\u2019 psychological health following injury. This study examined the effects of changes in social support on post-injury depressive and anxiety symptoms among college-student athletes. We conducted a prospective cohort study among Division I college-student athletes. Participants completed surveys at baseline and at multiple time points post-injury until return to play (RTP). A total of 597 injuries sustained by 389 student athletes (n = 400 (67.0%) males; n = 238 (39.9%) football players; n = 281 (47.1%) freshman) were included. The overall amount of social support increased from baseline to 1-week post-injury (p < 0.05) and then remained unchanged until RTP. The overall satisfaction with the support received increased from baseline to 1-week post-injury (p < 0.05) but decreased (p < 0.05) from 1-week post-injury to RTP. Increases in satisfaction with the support received were associated with decreases in post-injury depressive (\u03b2 = \u22120.404), p < 0.0001) and anxiety symptoms (\u03b2 = \u22120.406), p < 0.0001). Interventions involving social support may help hasten college-student athletes\u2019 psychological recovery from injury."
