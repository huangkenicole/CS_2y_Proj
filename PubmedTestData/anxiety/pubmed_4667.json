        "This randomized controlled trial examines whether a briefer cognitive-behavioural (CBT) stress management intervention than the norm can reduce stress and distress and enhance benefit finding in women with breast cancer. It further aims to identify characteristics of those women most likely to benefit from the intervention.",
        "A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of a psychological intervention. Women (N = 355) who had undergone surgery for breast cancer 4 months earlier, the majority of whom were currently undergoing adjuvant therapy, completed questionnaires assessing global and cancer-specific stress, depression, anxiety, optimism and benefit finding. They were randomly assigned to a 5-week group cognitive-behavioural stress management (CBSM) programme plus standard care or standard care only. Reassessment occurred post-intervention and 12 months later.",
        "Analyses of variance revealed that patients who received the intervention showed significant lowering of global stress and anxiety and increased benefit finding compared to controls. These differences, however, were not maintained at 12 months. Effects of the intervention were moderated by stress such that women with high global stress at baseline showed greater reduction in both stress and anxiety.",
        "A CBSM intervention, which was briefer than the norm (5 weeks vs. 9-20 weeks), had beneficial effects on adjustment for women with breast cancer and was particularly effective for those with increased global stress. Screening on this basis may facilitate optimal and cost-effective psychological treatment."
