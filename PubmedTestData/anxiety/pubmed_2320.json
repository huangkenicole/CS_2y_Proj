        "Gynecological malignant patients often have significant psychological and physical problems. The feasibility and generalizability of traditional intervention method is low due to the high time and labor cost, large number of gynecological malignant tumor patients in China, as well as shortage of health professionals. Therefore, it is necessary to design an alternative, innovative, and easily accessible intervention method. This study aims to evaluate the effect of WeChat-based intervention on anxiety, depression and disease-related symptoms of patients with gynecological malignant tumors during rehabilitation.",
        "A single-blinded, randomized, controlled, parallel-group pre-test and repeated post-test design will be conducted. A total of 76 participants will be randomly divided into the intervention group and control group. Anxiety and depression, disease-related symptoms, coping ability, benefit finding and quality of life will be measured at baseline and repeated immediately after the intervention (test 1), 3\u00a0months (test 2) and 6\u00a0months (test 3) after the intervention.",
        "As the first randomized controlled trial with rigorous research design for patients with gynecological malignant tumors in the rehabilitation stage in China, this study will provide evidences for the effectiveness of the WeChat platform during intervention of patients with gynecological malignant tumors in the rehabilitation stage. The results are helpful to further explore the effect of WeChat-based intervention on improving patients' anxiety and depression, disease-related symptoms, and quality of life.",
