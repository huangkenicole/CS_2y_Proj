        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intraoperative music listening on anxiety, the BIS index, and the vital signs of patients undergoing regional anesthesia in an operating room.",
        "Eighty patients who were scheduled for a surgery that would use regional anesthesia were allocated to either the music therapy group listened to music using headphones for the entire surgery or no-treatment control group. Outcome measures were blood pressure (BP) and the BIS index.",
        "Anxiety was significantly differed between the two groups (t=11.27, p=<.001). The BIS index was significantly lower in the experimental group than the control group from 15min to the end of the operation (F=7.25, p<.001). Vital signs marginally differed between the two groups.",
        "Music therapy during surgery maybe an effective nursing intervention that relieves anxiety and increases sedation in patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia."
