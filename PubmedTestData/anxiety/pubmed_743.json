        "Dental implant surgery is almost always associated with patient anxiety. Anxiety during dental surgical procedures triggers an increase in sympathetic activity. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is often associated with high levels of relaxation in the form of increased parasympathetic tone and decreased sympathetic activity. However, the effect of MM on dental anxiety is not clear. The current study aimed to show the effects of a MM as a sedative technique during dental implant surgery by examining the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), bispectral index (BIS), cortisol levels (CL), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) parameters. HR, SBP, DBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, BIS score and CLs were compared at the baseline, immediately before-, during-, and immediately after surgery between the test and control groups. We found that the MM resulted in significant decrease in BIS together with positive effects on hemodynamic parameters (decrease of HR, SBP, DBP and increase of SpO<sub>2</sub>), psychological findings (improvement on STAI-S scores) and biochemical outcomes (decreased CL). In conclusion, the results demonstrate that MM appeared to be a reliable strategy for managing stress during dental implant operation with benefits in psychological, physiological and biochemical outcomes."
