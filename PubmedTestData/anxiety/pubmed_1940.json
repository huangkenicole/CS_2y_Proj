        "The objective of this study is to study the involvement of anxiety/depression in patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention. Inpatients in the Department of Cardiology of Xuzhou Center Hospital from December 2012 to July 2014 were divided into stent group (100 cases) and the non-stent group (50 cases). Fifty cases in the stent group were treated with psychological methods, called intervention group, and other 50 cases were untreated and called non-intervention group. All patients were assessed for anxiety and depression using self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale, 1\u00a0day after admission, 1\u00a0day after coronary angiography, and when they were discharged. No significant differences were observed on biochemical criterion, and anxiety scores or depression scores between the stent and the non-stent groups before percutaneous coronary intervention (P value >0.05 for all). After percutaneous coronary intervention, anxiety/depression scores in the intervention group and non-intervention group were significantly higher than those in the non-stent group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant differences between the intervention group and the non-intervention group on anxiety/depression scores (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). On the day of discharge, the anxiety/depression scores were the lowest in the intervention group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Coronary artery intervention can increase patients' anxiety/depression, but appropriate psychological intervention can reduce the negative emotions."
