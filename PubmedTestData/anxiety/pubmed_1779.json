        "Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural pain management programmes (PMPs) are effective, but less is known about their use outside of research trials. Five years of data from offering the Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural PMP in an online therapy clinic was examined to assess effectiveness, acceptability and predictors of outcomes.",
        "Patients (N =\u00a0293) were offered a previously validated 8-week Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural PMP and administered measures at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3\u00a0months.",
        "There was growth in demand for an Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural PMP over time (n\u00a0=\u00a064 first year to n\u00a0=\u00a0133 fifth year). Moderate-to-large improvements on depression (post-treatment 35% reduction; 3-month 41% reduction) and anxiety (post-treatment 37% reduction; 3-month 41% reduction), and small-to-moderate improvements on disability (post-treatment 19% reduction; 3-month 20% reduction) were found. Lesson completion and satisfaction were high. Lower pain acceptance, lower pain self-efficacy and higher pain intensity were associated with lower improvements on depression, anxiety and disability.",
        "This longitudinal observational study provides support for Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural PMPs when offered as routine care by an online therapy clinic.",
        "This 5-year observational study provides support for Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural pain management programs (PMPs) offered as routine care in an online therapy clinic. Interest in the service grew over 5\u00a0years. Outcomes, engagement and satisfaction were strong. Higher pain acceptance, pain self-efficacy and lower pain severity were associated with greater post-treatment improvements on depression, anxiety and disability."
