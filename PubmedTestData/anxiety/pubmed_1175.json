        "Given the high prevalence and considerable clinical and societal burden of anxiety disorders, preventive measures are urgently warranted to reduce their incidence and overall healthcare impact. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) - a key element in learning theories of anxiety disorders in the context of interoceptive conditioning - constitutes a malleable risk factor of particularly panic disorder and separation anxiety, which share developmental, nosological, epidemiological and pathomechanistic characteristics. The computer-assisted 'Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment' (CAST) targeting interoceptive anxiety symptoms (cf. Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2014) was translated, intensified and culturally adapted to German and evaluated in a sample of 105 healthy adult volunteers with elevated AS (mean ASI-3: 29.5) applying a randomized design. Success of the intervention was measured as a function of AS and separation anxiety (ASA-27) \u223c6 weeks (T1) and \u223c6 months (T2) after the intervention. As compared to waitlist, CAST resulted in a significant reduction of AS at both T1 and T2. Separation anxiety was not directly reduced by the intervention, but decreased mediated by a decline in AS. A composite interoceptive score capturing changes in sensitivity to respiratory symptoms during the baseline therapist-accompanied CAST session was shown to be predictive of overall response at T1. In sum, CAST-German Version was successfully established as an effective intervention reducing AS, while at the same time indirectly decreasing separation anxiety. A composite interoceptive score predicting treatment response might aid in further delineating risk markers informing targeted preventive interventions for anxiety disorders."
