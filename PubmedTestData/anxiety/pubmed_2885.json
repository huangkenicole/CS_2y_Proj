        "Over 1.4 million adults in the United States are living with congenital heart disease (CHD), which can vary widely in disease burden and risk for future cardiovascular complications. As a result, some CHD survivors may experience greater emotional distress, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. This review summarizes the developing research literature on the prevalence, health impact, as well as screening and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms among adult CHD survivors. Additionally, the review will highlight findings from the acquired heart disease literature, a well-studied area that can inform research and clinical care practices for CHD survivors with depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. The review concludes with considerations for depression and anxiety screening in medical settings and identifying referral resources for treatment."
