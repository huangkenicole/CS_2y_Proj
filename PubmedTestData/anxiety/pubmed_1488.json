        "This study aimed to investigate the effect of the Bushen-Shugan (BSSG) method on pregnancy outcomes, serum D-dimer (D-D), platelet aggregation rate, homocysteine (Hcy) and antithrombin III (AT-III) in patients with recurrent miscarriage complicated by anxiety and depression.",
        "From December 2016 to December 2019, 100 patients with recurrent miscarriage combined with anxiety and depression were enrolled in our study, and a prospective randomized trial was carried out. Patients were randomly assigned to either the control group or the BSSG group via the random number table method. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome scores, laboratory indicators and psychological changes were compared in the 2 groups before and after treatment.",
        "After treatment, the primary, secondary and total TCM syndrome scores in the 2 groups were lower, and the scores in the BSSG group were significantly lower than in the control group. The clinical curative effect in the BSSG group was significantly higher (92% vs 76%) than in the control group. The levels of \u03b2-HCG, P, E2 and AT-III in the 2 groups were higher, while levels of D-D, platelet aggregation rate and Hcy were lower than before treatment. The Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were lower after treatment in both groups, and the scores in the BSSG group were significantly lower than in the control group.",
        "The BSSG method may be worthy of consideration because it improves pregnancy outcomes in patients with recurrent miscarriage complicated by anxiety and depression."
