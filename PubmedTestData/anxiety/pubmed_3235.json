        "Although upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is an important diagnostic procedure in the detection of diseases, it can cause discomfort and anxiety in patients. This study is a randomized controlled trial conducted to determine the effects of listening to music on the anxiety, pain, and comfort levels of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patients were randomly divided into the intervention group ( n = 40), who listened to music for 45 minutes before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and the control group ( n = 40), which did not receive any intervention other than routine nursing care. It was observed that the pain and anxiety levels of the patients who listened to music before the procedure decreased, and their comfort levels and ease of the procedure increased. In order to reduce the pain and anxiety of patients who will undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, increase the success of the procedure, and facilitate patient-doctor cooperation, encouraging patients to listen to music while awaiting the procedure can be effective."
