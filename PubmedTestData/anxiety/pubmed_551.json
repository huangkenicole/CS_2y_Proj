        "Adolescents who are Deaf or hard of hearing may be vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Adolescents' open communication with parents encourages positive sexuality. The relationship between the Deaf adolescent and their parent could be obstructed by communication difficulties. This article explores parents' anxieties about HIV risk. We interviewed nine parents of Deaf adolescents in South Africa. We explored their fears of the risk of HIV/AIDS for their children. Participants believed that their children were at risk of HIV infection. Although they did communicate with their children about sexuality and HIV/AIDS, some experienced communication difficulties. Communicative relationships between these adolescents and their parents should be encouraged."
