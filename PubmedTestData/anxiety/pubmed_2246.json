        "The prevalence of anxiety and stress among university students has been well established. However, limited studies document the effects of animal-assisted interventions (AAI) on college campuses.",
        "An AAI program was created and implemented during the 2021-2022 academic year to study the effects on students' stress and anxiety. Five faculty dog and handler teams, called the \"Wildpups,\" participated in events that allowed individuals to interact with registered therapy dogs. Nursing students assessed vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure before and after events. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory survey was used to assess pre- and postperceived anxiety, and a visual analog scale was used to assess pre- and postperceived stress.",
        "Participants' blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, and perceived stress and anxiety decreased significantly after events.",
        "Embedded AAI programs on college campuses positively affect the life and mental well-being of individuals. <b>[<i>J Nurs Educ</i>. 2023;62(11):631-637.]</b>."
