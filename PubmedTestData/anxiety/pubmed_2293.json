        "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the current status of depression and anxiety among female staff in a maternal and child health hospital, and to provide a basis for developing related prevention and intervention measures and promoting the mental health of female staff. <b>Methods:</b> The female staff from a provincial maternal and child health hospital completed a psycho-health questionnaire survey on Internet from June to October, 2016. The questionnaires used in the survey consisted of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) , and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) . The distribution features of mental health problems such as depression and anxiety were analyzed according to the <b>results:</b> of the questionnaire survey. Results Of all female staff surveyed, 42.04% showed depression symptoms, 28.90% showed anxiety symptoms, and 26.12% showed comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moderate or severe depression (anxiety) was mainly distributed among the female staff with comorbid symptoms (90.63% and 97.01%, respectively) . There were significant differences in the distribution of moderate or severe anxiety symptoms between the medical staff and nursing staff (\u03c7(2)= 5.81, <i>P</i>=0.05) and between those with intermediate and junior professional titles (\u03c7(2)=7.99, <i>P</i>=0.018) . As for SCL-90 results, the total score, total average score, and scores on factors of somatization, compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety in the female staff with comorbid symptoms, moderate or severe depression, and moderate or severe anxiety were significantly higher than the national norm (<i>P</i><0.01) , while the scores on paranoid and psychotic factors were significantly lower than the national norm (<i>P</i><0.01) . The numbers of cases of positive factors were significantly higher in the female staff with comorbid symptoms than in the female staff with a single symptom and asymptomatic female staff (both <i>P</i><0.01) , and positive cases were mainly distributed in depression, interpersonal sensitivity, compulsion, anxiety, and somatic factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of depression and anxiety is high among female staff in the maternal and child health hospital, mainly characterized by comorbid symptoms of moderate or severe depression and anxiety. Comorbidity is accompanied by mental health problems such as interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive compulsion, and physical discomfort. Corresponding measures are needed for the prevention and intervention of mental health problems among female staff in the maternal and child health hospital."
