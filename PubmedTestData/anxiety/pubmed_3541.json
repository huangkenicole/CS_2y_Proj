        "Mental distress is a collection of mental health abnormalities characterized by symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, forgetfulness, difficulty in concentrating, and somatic symptoms. It affects society as a whole and no group is immune to mental distress; however, students have a significantly high level of mental distress than their community peers. The study is aimed to assess the magnitude of mental distress and associated factors among a school of medicine and college of health sciences students.",
        "To assess the magnitude of mental distress and associated factors among a school of medicine and college of health sciences students at Debre Markos University, 2021.",
        "Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed from March 15-29, 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 475 study participants. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with mental distress. Variables with a p-value less than 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression analysis and a P-Value of less than 0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant association.",
        "The magnitude of mental distress among students was found to be 35.4%, 95%CI (31%, 40%). Female sex [AOR = 1.95; 95%CI (1.24-3.06)], financial distress[AOR = 1.64; 95%CI (1.062.54)], feeling of insecurity [AOR = 2.49; 95% CI (1.13-3.54)], lack of interest to department [AOR = 2.00; 95%CI (1.75-4.36)] and cumulative grade point average less than expected [AOR = 2.63; 95%CI (1.59-4.37)]were significant variables with mental distress.",
        "The magnitude of mental distress was high. Sex, financial distress, feeling of insecurity, lack of interest in the department, and cumulative grade point average less than expected were significant variables with mental distress, so special attention on mental health promotion is required from policymakers, college officials, parents, and other Non-Governmental organizations."
