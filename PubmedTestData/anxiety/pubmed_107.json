        "This is a cross-sectional study.",
        "To investigate spine surgeons' attitudes regarding preoperative anxiety measurement, management, and responsibility.",
        "The vast majority of patients scheduled for spine surgery experience preoperative anxiety. However, there are currently no consensus guidelines for measure or management of preoperative anxiety in spinal operations.",
        "An anonymous questionnaire was sent online to spine surgeons of AO Spine North America to capture their views regarding preoperative anxiety.",
        "Of 69 complete responses, most respondents were male (n=66, 95.7%), orthopedic surgeons (n=52, 75.4%), and practicing at an academic setting (n=39, 56.5%). Most spine surgeons practiced for at least 20 years (n=52, 75.4%), operated on 100-300 patients per year (n=48, 69.6%), and were attending physicians (n=61, 88.4%). Most did not measure preoperative anxiety (n=46, 66.7%) and would not use a rating scale to measure it (n=38, 55.1%). However, most would discuss it if mentioned by the patient (n=40, 58.0%). Other spine surgeons measured anxiety verbally (n=22, 31.9%) or with a rating scale or survey (n=6, 8.7%). Although preferences for preoperative anxiety management varied, most respondents used patient education (n=54, 78.3%) and permitting family members' presence (n=36, 52.2%) to reduce patient anxieties. Spine surgeons held themselves, anesthesiologists, and patients most responsible to manage preoperative anxiety.",
        "The majority of spine surgeons surveyed did not regularly measure preoperative anxiety, but would discuss its management if the subject was broached by the patient. Spine surgeons relied on a variety of methods to manage a patient's anxiety, but most preferred preoperative education and permitting the presence of family members. Responsibility for controlling preoperative anxiety was chiefly allocated to surgeons, anesthesiologists, and patients. Future avenues for research may include developing a preoperative anxiety measurement scale and management protocol specific to spine surgery.",
