        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an operating room nurse visit on the anxiety levels of surgical patients.",
        "A prospective, interventional, quasi-experimental design.",
        "80 patients were divided into the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a040) and the intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a040). The control group was given routine care, and the intervention group was visited preoperatively by the operating room nurse in addition to routine care.",
        "The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI TX-1) mean score of the control patients who had information about anesthesia was low, while the STAI TX-1 mean score of the patients who had concerns about surgery was high. The STAI-TX-1 mean score of the control group patients who had information about anesthesia was significantly lower. There was no statistically significant difference in the STAI TX-1 scores between the two groups before and after surgery (P > .05). However, the STAI TX-1 mean score of the control patients was high in the post-operative period.",
        "In an effort to reduce anxiety, the psychological preparation of the patient undergoing urological surgery should involve an anesthesia team member and the operating room nurse together."
