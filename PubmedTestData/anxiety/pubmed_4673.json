        "Mental health problems are pervasive nowadays. Adolescents are often expected to balance academic performance with familial obligations and work to support the family financially if they belong to low-socio-economic areas. These pressures can lead to Anxiety, stress, and even depression.",
        "The study's main objective is to assess the association of gender, parenting style, eating habit, and screen timing with the level of Anxiety among school-going adolescents in three peri-urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan.",
        "A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents of age group 10-19 years using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale in two months in, three populated peri-urban areas of Karachi, Pakistan. Collected Data was analyzed by statistical software SPSS version with 80% response rate.",
        "In our collected data, 544 students participated; 313 (57%) were female, and 231(42%) were male. Among them 173(33%) participants showed moderate to severe level of anxiety out of which 140(26%) were female and 33(7%) were male. As per our study, strict Parenting style plays a significant role in developing moderate to severe 108(20%) levels of Anxiety, shown among adolescents in the studied population. In addition to this, those who do not take tuition 115 (21%), do not use transport to school 91(16%), spend significant time in games on mobile and computer 101 (18%), and have no involvement in physical activities 172 (31%) show more moderate to severe level anxiety than others factors. A significant multivariate association between level of anxiety with gender, school commute, type of lunch Intake, smoker family member at home, physical activity, video game, tuition and strict parent.",
        "This study concluded that there are various factors which have great association with anxiety and can affect adolescents' mental health badly. The factors were parental strictness, video game playing, a sedentary lifestyle, and the smoking habits of family members. Children and adolescents must be evaluated as soon as possible while they are still young to prevent mental health issues."
