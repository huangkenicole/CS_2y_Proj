        "Symptom burden and reduced quality of life (QOL) are considerable hurdles in oncology. The authors used the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which assesses physical and psychosocial health, to establish a mean symptom burden, examine potential drivers, and characterize severe symptom burden in breast cancer patient subgroups with the goal of characterizing stage IV patient QOL and triaging patients to individualized supportive care services.",
        "New patients at the University of California San Francisco Breast Care Center received questionnaires with 8 PROMIS domains: depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep-related impairment, sleep disturbance, cognitive function, cognitive abilities, and physical function. PROMIS values were scored with the HealthMeasures service and were compared by age, cancer stage, and educational status.",
        "Stage IV patients with breast cancer (n = 169) reported higher depression and fatigue and worse cognitive function, cognitive abilities, and physical function than patients with stage 0 to III disease (n = 2577). As age increased, cognitive function impairment, depression, anxiety, and sleep-related symptoms decreased. More educated patients showed better physical function and less severe sleep disturbance and fatigue. Across all subgroups, patients with high anxiety had the greatest probability of worse symptom burden and function in other domains.",
        "This study provides an additional set of PROMIS population estimates across breast cancer demographic groups. The analysis of a large stage IV population reinforces that metastatic patients have impaired QOL across multiple domains. Because anxiety emerged as a potential driver of impaired QOL in other domains, earlier interventions to reduce anxiety could improve QOL overall. These analyses will help to determine appropriate thresholds of intervention.",
        "Patients receiving treatment for breast cancer can experience decreased quality of life. This study characterized differences in self-reported quality of life among patients of different ages, with different stages of cancer, and with different educational backgrounds. This study also examined the effect of decreased quality of life in one area (eg, anxiety) on another area (eg, difficulty in sleeping). Patients who were younger, had not attended college or technical school, or had stage IV cancer tended to have worse quality of life. Patients who had high levels of anxiety also tended to have high levels of impairment in other areas."
