      "AbstractText": [
        "Positive patient care and healthcare facility outcomes are associated with using various psychological interventions during magnetic resonance imaging and interventional radiology procedures. Interventions such as hypnosis, relaxation, guided imagery, and empathic communication can improve anxiety, pain, and hemodynamic stability during procedures, as well as improve claustrophobia and anxiety during magnetic resonance imaging. Little is understood as to the potential underlying mechanisms of how these interventions operate and contribute to positive outcomes. Thus, this article seeks to address that question by integrating autonomic nervous system functioning, neuropsychological concepts, and common factors theory of psychotherapy as potential underlying mechanisms. Opportunities for future directions in the field are also included."
