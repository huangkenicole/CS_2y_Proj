        "The purpose of this study was to examine whether subjective nearness-to-death moderated the association between health worries and death anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak among older adults in Israel. Using an online survey, 277 participants were recruited and completed self-reported questionnaires, which included background characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 risk experiences, self-rated health, subjective nearness-to-death, health worries regarding COVID-19, and death anxiety. Findings revealed that subjective nearness-to-death moderated the association between health worries and death anxiety. The importance and significance of subjective perceptions concerning the distance from death as far, which may serve as a resilient resource, is discussed."
