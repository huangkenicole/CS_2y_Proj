        "N2O is, perhaps, the best adjunct, available today, in the management of emotional factors which influence problem behavior. It is not panacea, however, and should be used only in conjunction with sound psychological methods. The use of N2O must not be thought of as a method by which dentists can elude their responsibility to deal logically with the fears and anxieties of the patient. The fears and anxieties are frequently the result of rational mental functions flowing logically from the individual's previous dental history and learning experience. Viewed thusly, patients can be assisted to overcome the problems at a logical level, and N2O or other sedatives may be mere tools to assist the patient in overcoming the emotional elements of the situation. The real worth of N2O can only be evaluated intelligently by those who learn to \"demand and to expect rational explanation in addition to empirical discovery\"."
