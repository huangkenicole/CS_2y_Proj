        "Hemodialysis (HD) patients have significant mental health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the psychopathological symptoms, death anxiety, coronavirus anxiety, suicide risk, and associated risk factors in HD patients during COVID-19.",
        "This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 15 to October 15, 2021, with 114 HD patients who were undergoing treatment in two central dialysis units.",
        "It was determined that HD patients had high levels of psychopathological symptoms. Approximately, one-third of HD patients (31.6%) had high to very high-level death anxiety. Additionally, of the participants 30.7% had coronavirus anxiety, and also the rate of severe suicide risk was 10.5%.",
        "HD patients have experienced various mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial support and interventions need to be planned by the healthcare system and healthcare providers to help HD patients in managing their disease and related mental health problems."
