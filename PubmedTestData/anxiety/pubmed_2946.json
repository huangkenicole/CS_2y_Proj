        "This study was planned to determine the effect of art-based mandala intervention on the distress and anxiety experienced by cancer patients.",
        "This semi-experimental study with a single group pretest-posttest design was performed with 12 breast cancer survival patients. The data were collected through \"Patient Diagnostic Form\", \"Distress Thermometer\", \"Trait Anxiety Inventory\". Patients participated in the \"Art-Based Mandala Intervent\u0131on\" for eight weeks, one day a week, 2\u00a0h each. The distress and anxiety levels of the patients were measured before starting the program and at the end of the program.",
        "Cancer patients experienced moderate level of anxiety (50.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.91) and clinically significant distress (4.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.74). Anxiety scores of cancer patients decreased significantly after the program compared to before the program (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The distress scores of cancer patients increased after the program compared to before the program (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).",
        "After the art-based mandala intervention program, anxiety scores of breast cancer survival patients decreased, and distress scores increased."
