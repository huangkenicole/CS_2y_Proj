        "This study explored how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals with mental health conditions.",
        "Participants were 477 adults (82% female) who reported a past-year mental health condition. They completed an online survey that included an open-ended question. Mixed methods analysis was conducted.",
        "While all mental health conditions were moderately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported impact on anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms was greater than for all other mental health symptoms. Thematic analysis revealed five themes: (1) the contribution of the pandemic to worsening mental health; (2) life interruptions due to the pandemic; (3) increased loneliness/isolation; (4) upsides of the pandemic; and (5) normalization of the anxieties previously experienced by those with mental health conditions.",
        "Individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions reported a worsening of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and organizations must focus on supporting and increasing access to treatment for this population."
