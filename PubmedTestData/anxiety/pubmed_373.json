        "A mail survey of several hundred hard and soft contact lens wearers was conducted focusing upon demographic characteristics of wearers, factors involved with purchasing, wearing and caring for lenses, and the attitudes, perceptions, and anxieties which wearers have about lenses. The results are presented in two papers. This paper reports on wearer behaviors, experiences, attitudes, and expectations. A number of differences were found between hard and soft lens wearers and between the regular and the occasional and former wearers. For example, occasional and former wearers in general were considerably more likely than regular wearers to express anxieties about several aspects of lens wear and care. Some implications of the data are discussed and suggestions for future research are outlined."
