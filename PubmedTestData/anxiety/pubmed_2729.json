        "Cognitive behavioural therapy is the first line of treatment for social anxiety disorder; however, children with social anxiety disorder do not respond as well to generic cognitive behavioural therapy programs, compared to children with other anxiety disorders. The aim of the study was to provide a preliminary examination of the efficacy and applicability of a new disorder specific intervention for children with social anxiety disorder. Five children aged 7-13\u00a0years, with a primary or secondary DSM-5 diagnosis of social anxiety disorder were provided with an adapted version of the Cool Kids anxiety program. Three out of the five children were in remission from social anxiety disorder at the end of the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Statistically significant improvements were also noted in overall anxiety symptoms and functioning. Preliminary evidence was found for the efficacy of a social anxiety version of the Cool Kids program."
