        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of central coherence in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). 22 female patients with AN (median age = 31.50 (QD = 8.13) years) and 33 female healthy controls (HC) (median age = 28.00 (QD = 8.50) years) participated in the study. Their central coherence was assessed with the Rey Complex Figure Task (RCFT). Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form JYZ. The results showed that AN patients' Central Coherence Index and accuracy scores in copy, 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks of the RCFT were significantly lower than those of HC. Moreover, the significant differences in Central Coherence Index score in copy task and accuracy scores in 3-min delayed recall and 30-min delayed recall tasks remained when the effects of depression, anxiety and starvation were eliminated statistically. These findings may explain some characteristics of AN patients such as focusing on local rather than global picture in their perception of body or life."
