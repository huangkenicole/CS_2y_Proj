      "AbstractText": [
        "Perioperative anxiety could negatively affect surgery outcomes, and cardiac diseases have long been known to be an independent risk factor for anxiety development. However, little is known about preoperative anxiety in Nepalese adult cardiac patients waiting for surgery. The primary objectives of this study were to: (1) clarify the levels of preoperative anxiety in Nepalese adult cardiac patients waiting for open heart surgery; (2) identify factors associated with preoperative anxiety; and (3) evaluate any possible factors associated with patients' desire to obtain information related to their heart surgery.This is a prospective observational study for patients already scheduled for cardiac surgery at a core medical institution in Kathmandu, Nepal. We collected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients from their medical charts, and assessed their preoperative anxiety using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale. We performed descriptive analyses of the collected data. Further, we employed regression models to assess to the objectives of the study.In total, 140 patients participated, and data of 123 (87.9%) were used for analysis. 58.5% of the participants had preoperative anxiety. Female gender (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.65, P\u200a<\u200a.001) and past anesthesia exposure (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.01-5.62, P\u200a<\u200a.05) were identified as risk factors for developing anxiety before cardiac surgery. Further, female gender (IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.94, P\u200a<\u200a.001), higher education levels (IRR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.40, P\u200a<\u200a.05), and higher preoperative anxiety (IRR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.73, P\u200a<\u200a.001) could lead to higher levels of desire to acquire information related to the procedure.The study concluded that more than a half of the cardiac surgery patients experiences preoperative anxiety; female gender and having past anesthesia exposure are the risk factors. Anxious patients have more desire to acquire knowledge about the procedure. Thus, the evaluation and adequate management of preoperative anxiety should be proposed in high-risk groups."
