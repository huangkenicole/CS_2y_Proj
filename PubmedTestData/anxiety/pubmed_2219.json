        "Reliable, valid, and brief measures are important for identifying young people in community contexts who experience mental health problems. This paper reports the development and preliminary validation of the Brief Emotional Distress Scale for Youth (BEDSY), a measure based on anxiety and depression symptoms that load strongly upon the general construct of emotional distress. Participants, aged 11-17 years, included 2663 from a community population and 281 referred anxious youth. From a pool of 20 items, eight were selected for the final scale using methods from classical test theory, followed by item response theory (IRT). The final eight items met the pre-specified criteria for skewness and kurtosis, item-total correlations, IRT characteristics, and discrimination between referred vs. community samples. Exploratory structural equation modeling for a bi-factor model indicated that 81% of total variance was explained by the general emotional distress factor. The 8-item BEDSY showed strong internal consistency, good construct validity, and acceptable sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between a community sample vs anxious youth, and between youth with and without high levels of depressive symptoms. As such the scale has strong potential as a brief screen for identifying emotionally distressed young people in community contexts."
