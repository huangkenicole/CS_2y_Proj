      "AbstractText": [
        "Dental anxiety is particularly problematic for individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), resulting in a greater reluctance to undergo dental procedures and exacerbating poor oral health. Drugs commonly used for dental anxiety have undesirable side effects and may not be preferred by patients and guardians. Alternative methods for managing dental anxiety are needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of music listening on anxiety levels of patients with IDD awaiting dental procedures.",
        "A convenience sample of 15 patients with IDD listened to piano music for 10\u00a0min before scheduled outpatient dental procedures. Preprocedural dental anxiety levels as measured by Revised ADAMS scores, pulse rates, and blood pressures were compared pre and post music listening. Participants' premedication requirements for the procedure with music listening was compared to their respective previously scheduled procedure with no music listening.",
        "Post music listening, patients demonstrated reduced anxiety levels as evidenced by lower Revised ADAMS scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), mean arterial pressures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09), pulse rates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and reduced premedication requirements.",
        "Study results suggest that music listening offers an effective, nonpharmacologic alternative to reducing preprocedural dental anxiety in patients with IDD."
