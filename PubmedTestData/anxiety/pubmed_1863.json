        "Psychological distress, such as chronic depression and anxiety, is a topical problem. In the context of cancer patients, prevalence rates of psychological distress are four-times higher than in the general population and often confer worse outcomes. In addition to evidence from epidemiological studies confirming the links between psychological distress and cancer progression, a growing body of cellular and molecular studies have also revealed the complex signaling networks which are modulated by psychological distress-derived chronic stress during cancer progression. In this review, aiming to uncover the intertwined networks of chronic stress-driven oncogenesis and progression, we summarize physiological stress response pathways, like the HPA, SNS, and MGB axes, that modulate the release of stress hormones with potential carcinogenic properties. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the mechanisms behind these chronic stimulations contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer through direct regulation of cancer hallmarks-related signaling or indirect promotion of cancer risk factors (including obesity, disordered circadian rhythms, and premature senescence), suggesting a novel research direction into cancer prevention and therapy on the basis of psychological interventions."
