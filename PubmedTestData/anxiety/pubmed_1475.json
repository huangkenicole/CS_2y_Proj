        "Black women and their infants face heightened health risks during pregnancy, labor, and delivery that, for many, cost them their lives. Such health risks during this critical period are linked to increased rates of anxiety among Black pregnant and postpartum women. Black women also endure racism when seeking support from mental health and healthcare providers, which further contributes to pregnancy and postpartum-related anxiety. Evidence on sister circles has demonstrated that this indigenous form of healing may provide Black pregnant and postpartum women with the support and skills needed to cope with stressors associated with mental and physical health concerns and racism.",
        "Our study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support, a sister circle cognitive behavioral therapy-based stress and anxiety intervention for Black pregnant and postpartum women.",
        "Our study employed a mixed-methods framework.",
        "Descriptive analyses, paired samples <i>t</i>-test, and open and selective coding were conducted. We utilized the following measures: Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale, focus booklet, and focus group discussion.",
        "Participants reported experiencing moderate levels of worry and distress and low levels of pregnancy-related anxiety prior to the start of the Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support intervention. Eighty women participated in Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support. Eleven focus groups were conducted to assess their experience. Participants reported a perceived increase in their knowledge about panic attacks and stress and ability to manage stressors effectively. They found that all completed activities contributed to their development and application of skills. They reported they enjoyed Birthing Beautiful Babies Sisters Offering Support because of the supportive environment, openness, and emphasis on sisterhood. Participants provided helpful feedback about the structure and flow of the intervention.",
        "Limitations of the present study and future directions are discussed."
