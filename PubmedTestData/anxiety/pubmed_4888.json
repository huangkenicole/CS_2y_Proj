      "AbstractText": [
        "Improvements in physical and adaptive psychosocial challenges after Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unclear to what extent these outcomes impact patients' health-related quality of life. This study was to determine the quality of life among patients 3 months after CABG surgery. More specifically, the study examines the contribution of a set of variables on the quality of life. A prospective cohort study was performed over 3 months among 219 adult patients prepared for elective Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. The data on the baseline measurements Short Form-36 to measure self-reported health-related quality of life and the state-trait anxiety inventory scale to assess anxiety were collected two days before and three months after CABG surgery. The Pearson correlation coefficient was adopted to examine the relationship between confounding, predictor, and dependent variables. Shapiro-Wilk test tested the normality of the distribution of numerical variables. A 2-tailed level of P-value < 0.05 was set to be statistically significant for all analyses. Mean preoperative postoperative physical and mental component score was 34.57 \u00b1 9.6, 43.53 \u00b1 7 and 54.87 \u00b1 1.19, 51.65 \u00b1 9.67, respectively, indicating poor quality of life. Preoperative anxiety uniquely explained with the variation 32.1% and 29.9% and it significantly predicts postoperative physical health quality of life as (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f.535, t\u202f=\u202f8.433, P < 0.001) and postoperative mental health quality of life as (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f.475, t\u202f=\u202f7.147, P < 0.001) respectively. Significant improvement in physical health over the 3 months was confirmed, but mental health-related quality of life is unconvincing with the substantial contribution of anxiety."
