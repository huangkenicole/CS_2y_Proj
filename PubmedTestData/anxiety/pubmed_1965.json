        "The 20th century has been described as the age of anxiety. Many have claimed that the pressures of a modern technological and competitive society are too great. Anxiety is a normal part of reaction to threats created by life situations especially when control is low. Some people perpetuate constant anxiety by oversensitivity to environmental events. Anxiety can reduce daily efficiency and become self-enhancing. Biological mechanisms may also sustain anxiety further. Treatments include addressing both the cognitive and the biological aspects of the state. Training people to cope with life and to find forms of control may be the most beneficial in the long term."
