        "EEG spectral power was calculated in 39 students at the age of 19-21 years in two experimental conditions: during the common educational process and immediately before an examination (stress condition). During the education process, in subjects with high anxiety (tested by Spielberger) the relative spectral power of the delta activity was higher than in the other group in the occipital, parietal, central, and right frontal brain areas, whereas the power of the EEG alpha in these areas was lower. Before examination tests, in subjects with high activity the delta power bilaterally increased in the temporal areas, whereas in subjects with low anxiety there was a decrease in the alpha rhythm power, especially in the right frontal area. In stress condition, the relative power of the delta activity in both occipital and temporal, right parietal and central areas was higher in subjects with low anxiety, whereas their alpha power was lower in both frontal and in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas of the left hemisphere."
