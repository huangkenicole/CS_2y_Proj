        "Anxiety is a frequently cited barrier to blood donor recruitment. Although the mere presence of donation paraphernalia can heighten anxiety for some individuals, such stimuli are a necessary and unavoidable part of donation. Drawing on France and colleagues' research on tailored donor education and coping materials, the current study assessed whether modifying recruitment materials could improve donor recruitment in a context where anxiety is heightened.",
        "A field study comprising a 2 (presence or absence of a mobile blood collection unit [MCU]) \u00d7 2 (recruitment brochure: standard, coping) between-subjects design was conducted with 922 nondonors who believed themselves eligible to donate blood. In either the presence or absence of the MCU, participants received a standard or modified recruitment brochure modeled on France and colleagues' education and coping materials. Donation anxiety, attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, and intention were assessed, and donation behavior was tracked for 30 days.",
        "Participants who were assessed in the presence of the MCU reported heightened anxiety, and female participants reported decreased self-efficacy. The coping brochure improved self-efficacy, heightened the intention to donate in the presence of the MCU, and promoted blood donation behavior relative to the standard brochure. Path analyses supported a model in which, in the presence of the MCU, the coping brochure boosted self-efficacy and led to increased donation intention and behavior.",
        "In a context in which donation-related anxiety is heightened, provision of materials that address prospective donor concerns and suggest coping strategies can bolster self-efficacy and promote recruitment."
