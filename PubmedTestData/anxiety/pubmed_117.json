        "Preoperative anxiety is a common phenomenon in plastic surgery that has been associated with numerous negative patient outcomes. Little is known about the preferences of plastic surgeons regarding management of patient preoperative anxiety OBJECTIVE: To determine the preferences of plastic surgeons regarding the assessment and reduction of adult preoperative patient anxiety in their primary practice setting.",
        "The membership of the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) was surveyed using an anonymous, online questionnaire from April to June of 2020.",
        "A total of 100 participants from a membership of 532 responded (19%). The majority of respondents (63%) did not formally assess patient anxiety but supported the use of standardized scales to measure anxiety (57%). Most plastic surgeons preferred patient education (81%), family member presence (69%), and visit from the anesthesiologist (54%) to reduce patient anxiety. Plastic surgeons also allocated the most responsibility to anesthesiologists (63%) and plastic surgeons (62%) to reduce preoperative anxiety.",
        "Most plastic surgeon members of ACAPS did not assess their patients' anxieties preoperatively but appeared willing to use anxiety scales. Plastic surgeons also supported several measures to reduce anxiety, especially patient education, family member preferences, and anesthesiologist visits. Although plastic surgeons appeared to hold multiple parties responsible to manage preoperative anxiety, they held themselves and anesthesiologists most responsible. Future studies are needed to determine whether these views cohere with those of other healthcare providers and whether these preferences change for pediatric patients.",
