        "The association between disfigurement ('visible difference') and romantic relationships has received relatively little consideration in the research literature. This qualitative research, conducted in the United Kingdom, explored participants' accounts of their visible difference and romantic life. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants who had a variety of visible differences. Inductive thematic analysis demonstrated that participants understood their difference as having a pervasive and enduring impact. These encompassed challenges that must be negotiated in the formation of romantic relationships, including feeling unattractive to others and feeling personally devalued. Relevant physical and sexual sequelae were comprised of anxieties regarding informing partners of a difference, impacted sexual activity, and concerns about heritability. Finally, the potential for partner support and acceptance to positively impact romantic relationships was recognised. This research highlighted the need to extend our understanding of visible difference and intimate relationships and to develop effective interventions to ameliorate appearance-related concern."
