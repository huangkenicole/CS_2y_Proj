        "<b>Background:</b> Increasing evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the brain controls anxiety and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety disorders. For example, both pharmacological and genetic disruption of cannabinoid receptor subtype-1 (CB<sub>1</sub>R) signaling in the central nervous system is associated with increased anxiety-like behaviors in rodents, while activating the system is anxiolytic. Sex is also a critical factor that controls the behavioral expression of anxiety; however, roles for the ECS in the gut in these processes and possible differences between sexes are largely unknown. <b>Objective:</b> In this study, we aimed to determine if CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the intestinal epithelium exert control over anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner. <b>Methods:</b> We subjected male and female mice with conditional deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the intestinal epithelium (intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>-/-</sup>) and controls (intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>+/+</sup>) to the elevated plus maze (EPM), light/dark box, and open field test. Corticosterone (CORT) levels in plasma were measured at baseline and immediately after EPM exposure. <b>Results:</b> When compared with intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>+/+</sup> male mice, intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>-/-</sup> male mice exhibited reduced levels of anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and light/dark box. In contrast to male mice, no differences were found between female intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>+/+</sup> and intCB<sub>1</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Circulating CORT was higher in female <i>versus</i> male mice for both genotype groups at baseline and after EPM exposure; however, there was no effect of genotype on CORT levels. <b>Conclusions:</b> Collectively, these results indicate that genetic deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the intestinal epithelium is associated with an anxiolytic phenotype in a sex-dependent manner."
