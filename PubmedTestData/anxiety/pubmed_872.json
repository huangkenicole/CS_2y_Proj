      "AbstractText": [
        "Arts engagement programs (AEPs) are non-clinical, structured programs led by artists and educators to support mental health and wellbeing. While evidence demonstrates positive mental health outcomes in adult AEPs, studies of childhood AEPs remain sparse. We created a gallery-based AEP (Culture Dose for Kids) for children with anxiety based on a successful arts engagement pilot for adults with depression. We questioned whether our tailored-for-children adult program would effectively and feasibly support children's mental health. Through parents' perspectives and feedback, this study tested the program's acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness with children with anxiety. Quantitative and qualitative measures were used to determine whether the program was an effective and acceptable mental health support for children with anxiety. Our findings revealed that the program positively and significantly impacted parental perceptions of their child's anxiety. Our findings illustrate depictions of improved mood, confidence, and sense of empowerment in the child, qualities associated with resilience and mental wellbeing. Open-ended activities provided opportunities for connection, creativity, and experimentation-sources of strength for improving mental health. This study adds to the small but growing evidence base supporting the role of arts-based community care in youth mental health and wellbeing."
