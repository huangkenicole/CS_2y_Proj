        "The Australian Medicare Better Access initiative in mental health reached one in every 10 Australians in 2021 (more than 2.6\u2009million people) with interventions targeted at mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, provided by general practitioners, allied health professionals, and/or psychiatrists, at a cost of AUD1.2\u2009billion. However, the overall mental health of the Australian population has not improved since the introduction of Better Access. The benefits of population-scale mental health interventions (medications and psychotherapies) might have been overestimated for milder conditions, and the iatrogenic potential underestimated. A recent evaluation of Better Access found that mild anxiety and depressive symptoms were threefold more likely to worsen (32%) rather than improve (10%). Better Access might be targeted more cost-effectively towards severe and complex conditions, for which treatment appears to have superior risk-benefit ratios. These findings have implications for similar initiatives worldwide, such as those proposed by the World Health Organization."
