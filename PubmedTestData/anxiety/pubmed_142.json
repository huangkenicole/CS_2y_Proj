      "AbstractText": [
        "Anxiety is commonly observed in oncology patients but infrequently screened, assessed or addressed. According to psychosocial guidelines, all healthcare professionals, including radiation therapists, are responsible for the psychosocial care of patients. Radiation therapists (RTs) interact with patients daily throughout treatment; however, little research exists to evaluate RTs' ability to identify and manage patients' psychosocial needs. This study aimed to determine if RTs can detect and manage patient anxiety.",
        "A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey containing two clinically relevant vignettes was developed. Two fictitious patients were presented to elicit responses reflective of RTs' experiences and judgements in the recognition and management of anxiety. Surveys were distributed via email in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Sydney (2016/227) and informed consent was obtained from participants.",
        "Eligible and complete surveys were received from 582 respondents (240 (41.2%) from Australia; 78 (13.4%) New Zealand; 264 (45.4%) Canada). Almost all respondents endorsed a relevant descriptor of anxiety (vignette 1, 577 (99.1%); vignette 2, 579 (99.5%)). For both vignettes, the most frequently endorsed management strategy was to acknowledge the patients' feelings and encourage them to express their concerns (vignette 1, 548 (94.2%); vignette 2, 455 (78.2%)).",
        "RTs in Australia, New Zealand and Canada are able to detect anxiety and endorse a strategy to manage patients experiencing anxiety depicted in written vignettes. Exploring RTs' abilities to detect and manage patient anxiety whilst in the high-pressure clinical environment is an important next step."
