        "Cancer is one of the chronic and rare diseases in children that is associated with psychological trauma that can cause fear and anxiety in patients. Considering that spirituality as a solid base may be a strong factor in controlling the tense conditions, this study aimed to investigate the effect of true heart spiritual care on cancer anxiety in Mashhad. This is a case-control study on 40 children referred to Dr. Sheikh Mashhad Children's Therapeutic Center in 2017. Sampling was done randomly in two groups of test and control. The experimental group received the training program in five sessions in 4\u00a0weeks. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and Marx children's anxiety scale and entered into spssv.20 software. There was no difference the score of anxiety before intervention in any of the dimensions of anxiety and the general dimension of anxiety in the case and control (P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, the mean of anxiety score in the SC group before and after intervention was significantly (75.25\u2009\u00b1\u200915.2) (44.55\u2009\u00b1\u20097.62), respectively. So that 50% of the posttest changes are due to the effect of the intervention. Regarding the effect of SC on reducing cancer anxiety, it is recommended that therapists, counselors and clinical psychologists use the spiritual care education method to reduce anxiety."
