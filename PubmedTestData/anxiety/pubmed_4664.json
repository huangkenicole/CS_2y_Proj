        "There is a scarcity of studies focusing on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and anxiety in Egypt. Accordingly, our study aimed to assess the association between anxiety and IBS symptomatology among Egyptian females. Three hundred eighty-three females (145 IBS and 238 controls) were included in the study, and data were obtained using structured predesigned questionnaires. IBS and anxiety symptoms were assessed according to the Rome IV criteria and the Arabic version of the beck anxiety inventory, respectively. Both IBS and non-IBS groups showed increased anxiety during the pandemic, without a significant difference between both groups (P value = .657). Higher levels of education were significantly associated with severe anxiety (P value = .031). Multivariate analysis of IBS patients showed that intermediate education was significantly associated with 75% lower odds for increased IBS symptoms compared with illiterate or read-and-write IBS patients [odds ratio (OR): 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.95, P value = .042]. Urban residence was significantly associated with 13.5 times greater odds of increased IBS symptoms, compared with rural residence (OR: 13.48, 95% CI 3.55-51.25, P value < .001). Moreover, patients who lost their job during the pandemic were 12.9 times more likely to have increased symptoms (OR: 12.89, 95% CI 1.84-90.15, P value = 0.01). A unit increase in patients age and beck anxiety inventory score was associated with 68% and 75% greater odds for increased IBS symptoms, respectively (OR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53, P value = .012; OR: 1.75, 95% CI 1.08-2.84, P value = .024). Increasing anxiety is associated with increased IBS symptoms. Therefore, IBS patients should be screened for anxiety, and the role of psychiatric management of anxiety in the amelioration of IBS symptoms must be explored."
