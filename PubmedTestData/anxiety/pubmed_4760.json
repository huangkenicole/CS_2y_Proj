        "To explore the feasibility of utilizing Cool Kids, a mainstream resource based on cognitive behavioural principles, to address acute and chronic anxiety with Aboriginal children in a remote setting.",
        "Evidence from the literature suggests some symptomatic differences and learning challenges which demand consideration prior to implementation in this population. In particular, cultural sensitivities in many areas need to be respected, as does the sense of interconnectedness in terms of self and thinking.",
        "Given sufficient knowledge, appropriate cultural protocol, and concentration on engagement it should be possible to use an adapted Cool Kids program to decrease the high levels of anxiety in a remote Indigenous population. Being aware of the differences in western and Indigenous thinking and learning will help direct adaptation."
