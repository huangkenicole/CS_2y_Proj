        "Effective strategies should be considered for reducing pain and anxiety and improving burn patients' well-being. This study was aimed to compare the effect of preferred music and Swedish massage on pain anticipatory anxiety in burn patients.",
        "In this randomized controlled clinical trial 240 hospitalized burn patients were selected and assigned to Swedish massage, preferred music, combination of Swedish massage and preferred music and control groups through fixed blocking randomization. Interventions was offered before wound care one time for 20\u202fmin on patients' bedside. Patients in the control group only received routine care. The Persian version of Burn Specific Pain Anxiety Scale were used for data gathering. Data was analyzed using SPSS-PC (V.16.0).",
        "There was a statistically significant difference between groups regarding mean changes of anticipatory anxiety (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). The results indicated that patients in the group of combination of both interventions reported significantly lower anticipatory anxiety as compared to the preferred music (P\u202f=\u202f0.015), Swedish massage (P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and control (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) groups. The mean changes of anticipatory anxiety score in the Swedish massage and preferred music groups had a statistically significant difference with the control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). There was no difference between the mean changes of anticipatory anxiety in preferred music and Swedish massage groups.",
        "According to the results, combining both Swedish massage and preferred music was more effective in reducing anticipatory anxiety in burn patients. Health care providers, particularly, nurses can provide these two noninvasive and economical interventions simultaneously and benefits the synergistic effect of them in burn patients."
