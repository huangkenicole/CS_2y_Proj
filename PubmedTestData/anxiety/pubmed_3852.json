      "AbstractText": [
        "Functional dyspepsia, originates from gastroduodenal region, is described as resistant and recurring dyspeptic symptoms with unknown etiology. Although there is some evidence in support of a relationship between functional dyspepsia and psychopathology, attachment patterns of functional dyspepsia patients have not been studied yet. In our study, we aimed to compare attachment patterns of functional dyspepsia patients with organic dyspepsia patients and healthy volunteers.",
        "43 patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia, 38 patients with organic dyspepsia and 42 healthy volunteers matched in terms of age, sex and education were included in the study. All participants were evaluated using a socio-demographic and clinical data questionnaire, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire and the Adult Attachment Scale.",
        "There was no difference in sociodemographic features among the three groups. Functional dyspepsia group exhibited significantly higher Trait Anxiety scores compared to organic dyspepsia and control groups. Control group showed significantly higher secure attachment styles compared to functional dyspepsia and organic dyspepsia groups, there was no difference between groups in non-secure attachment styles according to triple attachment model. Dimensionally, functional dyspepsia group showed more avoidant attachment patterns than organic dyspepsia groups and organic dyspepsia group showed more avoidant attachment patterns than control group.",
        "According to our findings, Functional dyspepsia patients are more anxious than organic dyspepsia patients and healthy volunteers. Non-secure attachment patterns were seen generally in all dyspeptic patients while avoidant attachment patterns are more prominent in functional dyspepsia patients."
