        "The aim of this study was to explore the structural relationships between dental anxiety, mood, and general anxiety among 220 dentally anxious patients who participated in a clinical study. A structural equation modeling analysis (SEM) was applied by using the LISREL program on the hypothesized latent variables dental anxiety, mood, and general anxiety, which were measured by means of several psychometric tests. The final model showed that mood and general anxiety had positive factor loadings on dental anxiety. However, the impact of the general anxiety latent variable was not significant as compared with the mood factor. Another finding was that the residual variance for the latent variable dental anxiety was 0.68, indicating that a major portion of the variance is still unexplained by the tested variables. In conclusion, this study showed a relationship between dental anxiety, general anxiety, and mood among dentally anxious patients."
