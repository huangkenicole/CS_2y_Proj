        "Test anxiety is a prevalent issue among students, including those in the medical field. The present study aims to examine the impact of auricular acupressure on reducing test anxiety specifically among medical students.",
        "In this single-blind randomized parallel-group trial, a total of 114 medical students from Kermanshah, Iran, were allocated into two groups: intervention and control. Each group consisted of 57 students. The data collection instruments included a demographic information form and the Sarason Anxiety Inventory. In the intervention group, bilateral auricular acupressure was administered on the Shen Men point for a duration of 10\u00a0min. On the other hand, the control group received bilateral auricular acupressure on the Sham point, located in the earlobe, as a placebo, also for 10\u00a0min.",
        "The mean test anxiety scores in the Shen Men acupressure group exhibited a significant reduction from 18.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 before the intervention to 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 after the intervention (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Conversely, in the Sham acupressure group, the mean test anxiety scores showed no significant change, with values of 16.36\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 before the intervention and 16.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 after the intervention (P\u2009=\u20090.963). Prior to the intervention, the majority of participants in both the intervention group (87.7%) and control group (86.0%) exhibited moderate to severe levels of test anxiety. Following acupressure, a significant improvement was observed in the intervention group, with 52.6% of participants experiencing a reduction to mild anxiety levels (P\u2009=\u20090.001); however, no notable change in anxiety levels was observed in the control group. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference in anxiety intensity after the intervention was found between the two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.001).",
        "Shen Men auricular acupressure demonstrates efficacy in reducing test anxiety among medical students. However, to validate its effectiveness, further research using objective measures is warranted."
