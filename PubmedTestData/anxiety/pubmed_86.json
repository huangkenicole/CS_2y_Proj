        "To better understand the behavioral factors contributing to the mental health status among student athletes, we examined the link between recreational screen time and college student athlete's anxieties. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 278 college student athletes from Shanghai, China, aged between 17 and 25 years old (<i>M</i> = 19.4, <i>SD</i> = 1.5). Multivariate regression analyses, controlled for age, gender, rural vs. urban residency, and individual vs. team sports factors, were performed to analyze the association between their average daily recreational screen time in a week and their dispositional anxiety, pre-competition anxiety, and anxiety during competition, which were measured by the Chinese version of validated psychometric scales among athlete population. Significant results were found in both dispositional anxiety and situational anxiety in relation to recreational screen time among college athletes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that excessive recreational screen time is a risk indicator of college student athletes' dispositional anxiety, pre-competition anxiety, and anxiety during competition."
