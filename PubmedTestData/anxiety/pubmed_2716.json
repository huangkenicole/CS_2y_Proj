      "AbstractText": [
        "The present review aimed to establish prevalence rates of anxiety and depression in adults with haematology cancer, with a focus on the differences between patients under treatment and patients under watchful waiting.",
        "Five databases (Scopus, Medline, PsycINFO, EThOS, CINAHL) were searched throughout June 2021. Key search terms included haematology cancer, anxiety, depression, in treatment and watchful waiting. Study and sample characteristics, prevalence rates and mean self-reported scores of anxiety and depression data were extracted.",
        "A total of 18 eligible papers were included in the review. Quality appraisal indicated papers were of adequate standard. Depression data from 2720 participants (14.5% under watchful waiting) and anxiety data from 2520 participants (15.9% under watchful waiting) were analysed through subgroup meta-analyses. The prevalence of anxiety was 34% amongst adults receiving treatment and 24.5% amongst those under watchful waiting. The prevalence of depression amongst adults receiving treatment was 31.3%, significantly higher than 16.1% of adults under watchful waiting.",
        "Overall, adults with haematology cancer were at greater risk of experiencing anxiety and depression than the general population, with greatest risk in those under treatment. The findings indicate the need for future research to examine availability and effectiveness of targeted psychological interventions."
