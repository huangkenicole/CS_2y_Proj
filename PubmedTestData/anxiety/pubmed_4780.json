        "To explore the effectiveness of a sensory stimulation intervention on intensive care unit patients' psychosocial, clinical, and family outcomes.",
        "A prospective, assessor-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial.",
        "A surgical intensive care unit of one tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, mainland China.",
        "Participants in the intervention group received a daily 30-minute auditory and visual stimulation session starting from recruitment and for a maximum of seven days while in the intensive care unit.",
        "One hundred fifty-two patients and family caregiver dyads were recruited. Patients in the intervention group showed lower total scores of post-traumatic stress disorder (21.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.34 vs 27.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35,p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), depressive symptoms (3.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.99 vs 6.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.75,p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and delusional memories (0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 vs 0.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.23,p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) collected immediately post-intervention than those in the control group, while not on depressive symptoms at one-month post-intervention (3.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.03 vs 3.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.77,p\u00a0=\u00a00.800). Sensory stimulation did not significantly impact patients' unit length of stay and 30-day mortality (allp\u00a0>\u00a00.05). For family outcomes, family caregivers in the intervention group had greater satisfaction with care (127.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.14 vs 114.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.97,p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and a lower level of anxiety (28.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.48 vs 34.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.68,p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) than family caregivers in the control group.",
        "Sensory stimulation may benefit patients' and family caregivers' psychological well-being, and further well-designed multi-centre clustered randomized controlled trials could be considered to strengthen the evidence."
