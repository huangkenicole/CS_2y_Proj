      "AbstractText": [
        "Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates (approximately 50-79%) of comorbid anxiety problems. Given the significant interference and distress that excessive anxiety can cause, evidence-based intervention is necessary in order to reduce long-term negative effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy for treating anxiety disorders across the lifespan, both in individual and group formats. Recently, modified CBT programs for youth with ASD have been developed, showing positive outcomes. To date, these modified CBT programs have primarily been evaluated in controlled research settings.",
        "The current community effectiveness study investigated the effectiveness of a modified group CBT program (Facing Your Fears) delivered in a tertiary care hospital and across six community-based agencies providing services for youth with ASD. Data were collected over six years (N = 105 youth with ASD; ages 6-15 years).",
        "Hospital and community samples did not differ significantly, except in terms of age (hospital M = 10.08 years; community M = 10.87 years). Results indicated significant improvements in anxiety levels from baseline to post-treatment across measures, with medium effect sizes. An attempt to uncover individual characteristics that predict response to treatment was unsuccessful.",
        "Overall, this study demonstrated that community implementation of a modified group CBT program for youth with ASD is feasible and effective for treating elevated anxiety."
