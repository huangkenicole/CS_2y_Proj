        "We conducted this prospective study to assess the anxiety in outpatients receiving chemotherapy for solid cancers.",
        "Patients were eligible if they were receiving chemotherapy for solid cancer in an outpatient setting, had a life expectancy of more than 6 months, and were able to complete self-administered questionnaires. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure the anxiety levels.",
        "From January to December 2004, 119 patients were recruited, and, of these, 114 completed the questionnaires. Their median age was 60.6 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.04:1. Of the 114 patients, 36 had breast cancer, 35, colorectal cancer, 23, gastric cancer, 8, esophageal cancer, 5, non-small-cell cancer, 4, pancreatic cancer, and 3, liver cancer. The state- and trait-anxiety levels were higher for women (p=0.019). Age did not influence the trait-anxiety level, but the state-anxiety levels of younger patients were higher. The periods of chemotherapy raised the state and trait-anxiety levels (p=0.023 and 0.015, respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed according to the type of cancer.",
        "The anxiety levels of outpatients with solid cancer receiving chemotherapy were significantly high. Having access to such information will help oncologists provide appropriate support to their patients."
