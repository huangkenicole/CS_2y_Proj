        "The automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) is one treatment method employed for patients with actual or potential malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Support group intervention has been shown to be of value in promoting adaptation and coping skills. This exploratory pilot study compared the psychosocial effects of support group intervention on 11 AICD recipients who regularly attended support group, ten spouses, or significant others who also attended and five AICD recipients who were unable to attend. The Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, The Anxiety Visual Analogue Study (VAS), the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Short Form General Health Survey, and anecdotal reports were used. Results showed that quantitative data were not significantly changed by support group interventions. Qualitative data demonstrated improved ability to cope and increased satisfaction with life in group participants, however, it was difficult to ascertain whether this was a result of passage of time."
