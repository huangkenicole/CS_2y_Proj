        "Although current irritability and current/prior anxiety have been associated in unipolar depression, these relationships are less well understood in bipolar disorder (BD). We investigated relationships between current irritability and current/prior anxiety as well as other current emotions and BD illness characteristics.",
        "Outpatients referred to the Stanford Bipolar Disorders Clinic during 2000-2011 were assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation. Prevalence and clinical correlates of current irritability and current/prior anxiety and other illness characteristics were examined.",
        "Among 497 BD outpatients (239 Type I, 258 Type II; 58.1% female; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD age 35.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.1 years), 301 (60.6%) had baseline current irritability. Patients with versus without current irritability had significantly higher rates of current anxiety (77.1% versus 42.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and history of anxiety disorder (73.1% versus 52.6%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Current irritability was more robustly related to current anxiety than to current anhedonia, sadness, or euphoria (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and current irritability-current anxiety associations persisted across current predominant mood states. Current irritability was more robustly related to past anxiety than to all other assessed illness characteristics, including 1\u00b0 family history of mood disorder, history of alcohol/substance use disorder, bipolar subtype, and current syndromal/subsyndromal depression (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).",
        "Limited generalizability beyond our predominately white, female, educated, insured American BD specialty clinic sample.",
        "In BD, current irritability was robustly related to current/prior anxiety. Further studies are warranted to assess longitudinal clinical implications of relationships between irritability and anxiety in BD."
