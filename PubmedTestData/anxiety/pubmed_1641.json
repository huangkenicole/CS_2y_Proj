        "Examined the applicability of EMG biofeedback to alleviating subjectively experienced test-taking anxiety along with the effects of relaxation training on locus of control. The Achievement Anxiety Test (AAT) was administered to 271 freshman psychology students. Students whose scores indicated high levels of test anxiety were invited to participate. Twenty-seven volunteers were assigned randomly to three groups. Biofeedback (B) Ss received relaxation instructions and EMG biofeedback. Instruction-Control (IC) Ss received instructions alone. A second control group (C) received no treatment. Pre and post measures included the AAT, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Rotter Locus of Control (I-E) Scale. Relaxation training involved eight half-hour sessions, two per week for 4 weeks. B and IC Ss changed significantly from pre to post on the anxiety measures. This was true for specific test-taking anxiety and for general anxiety. C Ss showed no change. On the I-E scale, only IC Ss showed a significant shift toward being more internal."
