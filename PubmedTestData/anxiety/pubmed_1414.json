        "Preoperative anxiety has adverse effects on children and negative impacts on postoperative rehabilitation. Anesthesiologists can accurately identify children with preoperative anxiety, and individualized intervention can effectively improve their psychological state and clinical prognosis. However, a comprehensive summary of the current available evidence has yet to be conducted. Searches were conducted in Medline databases from inception to March 2022. Primary studies that reported preoperative anxiety in children and its attendant effects on postoperative recovery and prognosis were screened and included. Among the 309 publications identified, 12 related studies (<i>n</i> = 3540 patients) met the eligibility criteria. The incidence of preoperative anxiety in children in the included studies ranged from 41.7% to 75.44%. While 16 influencing factors were identified, only 5 factors had a significant impact on preoperative anxiety in children: younger age (<i>n</i> = 8), parental anxiety (<i>n</i> = 7), negative previous hospitalizations (<i>n</i> = 3), less sociableness (<i>n</i> = 2), and surgical setting (<i>n</i> = 1). The current scoping review identified risk factors for preoperative anxiety in children. Healthcare workers should identify and manage preoperatively anxious children. There are still some factors that are controversial, and large-scale clinical studies are needed."
