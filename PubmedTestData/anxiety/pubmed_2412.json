        "Oral presentations of clinical cases by medical students during medical rounds in hospital wards are a source of anxiety and little is known about how this anxiety can be alleviated. The objective of this study was to investigate whether video-based feedback of public oral presentations can reduce anxiety in 4th year medical students.",
        "Multicentre randomized study conducted in six intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) in France over a 9-month period in 2012. One hundred and forty two 4th year medical students were randomized to two groups: intervention and control. Students in the intervention group were recorded while making an oral presentation of a patient during morning ward rounds, followed by video-based feedback. Students in the control group conducted presented classical oral presentations without being filmed and with no formal feedback. Anxiety levels during a public oral presentation were assessed using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). The primary outcome was the difference in STAI-S scores between groups at the beginning and at the end of a 3-month ICU or ED internship.",
        "Seventy four students were randomized to the 'video-based feedback' group and 68 were randomized to the control group. In both groups, STAI-S scores were significantly lower after 3 months of internship. However, the reduction in STAI-S scores was significantly greater in the \"video-based feedback\" group than in controls (-9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20099.3 vs. -4.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2, p\u2009=\u20090.024. Compared to the control group, significantly fewer students with high-level anxiety were observed in the \"video-based feedback\" group after 3 months of internship (68 vs. 28%, p <0.001).",
        "Compared to \"usual practice\", video-assisted oral feedback reduced anxiety and significantly decreased the proportion of students experiencing severe anxiety."
