        "Worry is the most common psychological complaint among patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). This study aimed to translate and test the psychometric properties the Rating Form of IBD Patient Concerns (RFIPC) among Dutch-speaking patients with IBD in Belgium. It also aimed to describe worries and concerns, and to examine possible differences in worry patterns between patients with different disease types and disease activities.",
        "The RFIPC was translated into Dutch following the guidelines of the Rome Foundation and was completed by patients with Crohn's disease (CD, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009336) and ulcerative colitis (UC, <i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009160). To test concurrent validity, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) were used. Factor structure was examined with confirmatory factor analysis.",
        "The four-factor structure including subscales 'impact of the disease', 'sexual intimacy', 'complications of the disease' and 'body stigma' was confirmed in the Dutch sample. All factors had high internal consistency (>.70). Correlations with DASS-21 suggest good concurrent validity, all <i>r</i>s>.30, <i>p</i>s<.001. No differences in the RFIPC scores were observed between patients with CD and UC. Patients with active disease (53%) had higher scores than patients in remission (47%). Across all groups, the order of top concerns was consistent and included worries about energy level, side effects of medication, having an ostomy bag/surgery, and uncertain nature of the disease.",
        "The Dutch version of the RFIPC is a valid and reliable measure of IBD-specific worries and concerns which can be used in both research and clinical settings."
