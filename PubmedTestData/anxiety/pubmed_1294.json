        "Prior research has suggested that art-based interventions may reduce anxiety in cancer patients and enhance dialogue in the healthcare setting. Through implementing Art at the Bedside, an art-based hospital visitation program, we sought to examine whether dedicated art observation sessions, and varying formats (with and without guided discussion), could have therapeutic effects on cancer patients' mental wellbeing.",
        "This randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the effects of bedside art observation on anxiety in a sample of 73 hematologic cancer inpatients. We compared state anxiety, as measured by an abbreviated form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y-6), across three groups (participants who observed an electronic selection of artwork with and without guided discussion, and a control group that did not engage in either dedicated art observation activity).",
        "We found that mean anxiety scores were significantly lower among those who participated in guided art observation, compared to those who did not (8.92 versus 12.1, scored on a scale of 6 to 24, p\u2009=\u20090.009, with a medium effect size (\u03b7<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200912.7)). The majority of participants who engaged in art observation felt that the activity provided positive distraction (85.7%) and decreased boredom (79.6%), and many noted that it reduced feelings of anxiety (46.9%) and depression (24.5%).",
        "These findings suggest that bedside art observation, particularly with guided discussion, may be a promising complementary therapy for reducing cancer-related anxiety and improving the patient experience in the inpatient hematology/oncology setting, and would benefit from further inquiry."
