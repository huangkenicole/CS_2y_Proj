        "Recent studies have revealed the possibility that the offensive subtype of social anxiety disorder (SAD) may no longer be a culture-bound syndrome; however, detailed clinical pictures have never been reported. This study investigated the differences between the offensive and non-offensive subtypes of SAD in terms of the background and axis I and II comorbidity.",
        "A total of 139 patients with SAD based on DSM-IV criteria were studied by conducting a semi-structured interview including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.",
        "Fifty-two (37%) patients were classified with the offensive subtype. There were no significant differences in most demographic variables and axis I lifetime comorbidity between offensive and non-offensive subtype patients. On logistic regression analysis, offensive subtype patients showed a more frequent history of parental physical abuse, higher Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores, and more frequently exhibited obsessive--compulsive personality disorders than non-offensive subtype patients.",
        "Yamashita (1977) reported that the majority of offensive subtype patients were doted on by their parents, although current offensive subtype patients are more likely to have had a troubled childhood, show severer forms of SAD, and more frequently exhibit an inflexible personality. This study suggested that the offensive subtype might not be essentially different from the non-offensive subtype (quantitative rather than qualitative)."
