        "There is a strong link between emotional reactivity and hypertension, yet little research to date has examined mediators of this relationship. Ourstudy \u00a0investigated the mediating roleof anxiety on the relationship between emotional reactivity and blood pressure elevations. Participants were226 hypertensive patients (93 men and 133 women, Mean age\u00a0=\u00a053.09, SD\u00a0=\u00a013.88\u00a0years), purposivelydrawn from the General Outpatient Department in University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, , Nigeria. . \u00a0Measures for data collection were Emotional Reactivity Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Mercury Sphygmomanometer. Hayes PROCESS macro for SPSS which uses a regression-based, path-analytical framework, was employed in analysing the data. Results showed that emotional reactivity was positively associated with blood pressure elevations. Anxiety was positively associated with blood pressure elevations. Anxiety also fully mediated the relationship between emotional reactivity and blood pressure elevations, even after adjusting for the control variables\u00a0(e.g., age, family history of hypertension, and educational status). The finding suggests that being less emotionally reactive is associated with a decrease in disabling influences of anxiety, thereby contributing to lower levels of mean arterial blood pressure. The findings may be helpful \u00a0in improving prevention, control and management of hypertension in healthcare."
