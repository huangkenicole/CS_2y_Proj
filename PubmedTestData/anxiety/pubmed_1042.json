        "In this randomized study, influences of dietary sodium restriction as an independent factor on anxiety levels of women participating in an in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) procedure were investigated. Anxiety levels of 119 women were measured using the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data of 69 women remained for analysis. Drop-outs, mainly due to cycle cancellations, tended to have higher mean state anxiety scores compared with women who continued (p = 0.11). Bias by selection affected both diet groups in similar proportions. State as well as trait anxiety scores increased significantly (p = 0.01, and p = 0.03, respectively) from baseline (before ovarian stimulation) to the point of measurement in the luteal phase. No significant differences in this mean increase were observed between the two diet groups. The significantly higher mean increase in state and trait anxiety in conceiving women was striking compared with those who did not conceive (p = 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). We conclude that dietary sodium restriction does not lower anxiety levels during an IVF-ET procedure. Anxiety levels increase more from baseline (before ovarian stimulation) to the luteal phase in conceiving than in nonconceiving women. The influence of conception on anxiety levels needs further investigation."
