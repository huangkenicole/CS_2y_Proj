        "The objective of our survey was to evaluate the anxiety experienced by women receiving abnormal results of prenatal Down syndrome screening by an electronic anonymous survey. Anxiety level was evaluated by a six-item Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Of 559 respondents, high anxiety scores were reported in the majority (86.0%). Higher anxiety scores were noted in women informed of the abnormal result by the caregiver vs. written answer. 59.1% of the respondents preferred the risk reported as percentage, while only 4.4% gave precedence to the current form (e.g. 1 in 100). The participants noted several factors which could relieve their anxiety, including an explanatory booklet (72.4%) or a website (77.9%). In conclusion, women receiving abnormal results of Down syndrome screening experience significant anxiety. Efforts should be made to relieve this distress, including changing the historical ratio risk format to percentage, adding a non-directive verbal annotation, an explanatory website and improving health professionals' understanding of the exact statistical meaning of the risk.Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Abnormal results of prenatal screening for Down syndrome might cause the women significant anxiety. Several simple methods are able to relieve this distress; however, they are frequently not implemented in the routine practice.<b>What the results of this study add?</b> We show that abnormal results of the screening tests are associated with high anxiety scores in the majority of women (86.0%). The majority of the respondents preferred the risk reported as percentage (vs. historical representation as a ratio). The participants noted several factors which could relieve their anxiety, including an explanatory booklet or a website.<b>What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Based on the results, we discuss the numerous ways able to available alleviate the distress."
