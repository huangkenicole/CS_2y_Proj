        "144 5- to 13-yr.-old children of substance abusers, enrolled in an expressive arts therapy program, were tested for depression on the Children's Depression Inventory and for anxiety on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale prior to treatment. Total scores for anxiety were significantly higher for girls than for boys; however, total depression scores did not differ between boys and girls. Analysis of subscale scores on each of the tests indicated several sex differences. Age was positively correlated with certain symptoms of depression for boys but not for girls. Conversely, age was negatively correlated with certain symptoms of anxiety for boys but not for girls. When compared to known norms for these assessments, girls scored significantly higher on total Depression but not differently than normals on total Anxiety. Boys, however, scored significantly lower on total Anxiety but did not score differently than normals on total Depression. We interpreted these findings as indicating that young children of substance abusers may be at risk for certain symptoms of anxiety and depression following their parents' addiction. Also, these symptoms may be manifest differently by boys and girls of various ages."
