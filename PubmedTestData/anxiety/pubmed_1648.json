        "To assess pediatric primary care providers' (PCPs) knowledge, perceived barriers, and needs related to child and adolescent anxiety in their practice.",
        "Primary care providers licensed and practicing in the state of Colorado were invited to complete an online knowledge and needs assessment. The survey queried their knowledge of pediatric anxiety, experience in assessing and treating anxiety, perceived barriers in their practice setting to adequately addressing youth anxiety, and interest in additional training on this topic.",
        "Survey completers included 115 PCPs (51 medical doctors and 64 nurses/nurse practitioners). PCPs had been practicing with their current medical license with pediatric patients for an average of 14 years (SD = 10.45), and 70% reported that they regularly discuss anxiety with patients and parents. Although PCPs had a basic knowledge of youth anxiety, there appeared to be significant gaps in PCP knowledge. Specifically, knowledge gaps included evidence-based assessment and treatment, how to differentiate between developmentally appropriate, transient episodes of anxiety versus anxiety disorders, and where and how to refer youth for specialty services. Nearly all (80%) PCPs indicated that they would be \"extremely interested\" in additional training in pediatric anxiety, particularly if it occurred in their organizational setting, at a nearby community setting, or online.",
        "Primary care providers reported that a substantial proportion of the patients they see struggle with anxiety. PCPs also reported a growing need for training in how to assess, treat, and refer anxious youth. This needs assessment supports a need for the development of easily accessible training and resources for PCPs to better support their pediatric patients."
