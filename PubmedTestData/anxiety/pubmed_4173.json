        "Although the use of support groups for patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended, little information concerning support and anxiety exists in relation to group attendance. Using a comparative descriptive design, this study sought to examine differences in demographics, ICD indicators, anxiety, and social support between the ICD recipients who attended a support group and those who did not. Characteristics of 150 ICD patients (77 nonattendees, 73 attendees) were evaluated using Sarason's 6-item Social Support Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results show that those who attended a support group had higher trait anxiety (P=.05) and were less satisfied with their social support (P=.03) compared with nonattendees. Among all participants, trait anxiety was higher in those diagnosed with tachycardia (P=.046). Finally, higher satisfaction with support was associated with less anxiety (P=.000) and a larger social network (P=.02). Thus, support group attendees were not less anxious, nor did they experience more support than nonattendees, indicating that support groups may serve a vital role for ICD recipients who are characteristically anxious and lack supportive resources. This study recommends evaluating patient support and anxiety to improve support group efficacy."
