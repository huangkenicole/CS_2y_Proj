        "Inpatient antepartum women have higher levels of anxiety than outpatient. Former randomized trials using mindful meditation programs to decrease maternal anxiety have conflicting results; some studies showed a considerable decrease in anxiety levels, whereas others showed no difference. A paucity of trials exist using mindful meditation for maternal anxiety in the inpatient antepartum population; most studies focus on the outpatient clinic population. Because of inpatient acuity and anxiety factors, we conducted a randomized trial to target this population.",
        "This study aimed to compare anxiety levels on day 4 of either routine care or routine care plus a twice-daily application-based mindful meditation program in women admitted to the antepartum unit.",
        "In a multisite randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03737279), women admitted to the antepartum units were randomized to either routine care plus educational pamphlets (control arm) or routine care plus a twice-daily application-based mindful meditation program (intervention arm). The inclusion criteria were age of at least 18 years, gestational age of at least 23 weeks, planned inpatient care for >3 days from randomization, and care by our university physician team. The primary outcome was maternal state anxiety level (measured using the validated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) on day 4 (randomization being day 1). The secondary outcomes included stress (measured using the Perceived Stress Scale) and depression (measured using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) on day 4, latency period from randomization to delivery, patient experience, number of meditation sessions, and total meditation time. A total of 56 women were needed for 90% power to detect a decrease in the primary outcome by 30% in the intervention group, compared with the control group. All women were observed using an intention-to-treat analysis. We compared the continuous variables using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t test and the categorical variables using the chi-squared test or the Fisher exact test.",
        "From March 4, 2019, to December 20, 2019, 412 women were screened for eligibility, 77 women (18.7%) were found eligible, and 56 women (72.7%) were randomized with 28 women in each group. Of note, 96.4% of women completed at least 1 meditation session, and 39.3% of women completed all meditation sessions. The mean score of the anxiety level using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory on day 4 was not significantly different (P=.24) between the control group (42.0\u00b110.8) and meditation group (37.5\u00b113.1). A decreased anxiety score from day 1 to day 4 was seen in both the control group and meditation group (-4.7 vs -9.4, respectively; P=.12). The rate of abnormal State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores on day 4 was not significantly different between the control group and meditation group (62% vs 45%, respectively; P=.28). When asked about the experience with the research trial, 88.8% of women in the control group and 89.5% of women in the meditation group reported a positive experience.",
        "Compared with the control group, a twice-daily application-based mindful meditation program for women admitted to the antepartum unit did not considerably decrease the anxiety score on day 4. However, >88% of women in both groups had a positive experience with the nonpharmacologic intervention."
