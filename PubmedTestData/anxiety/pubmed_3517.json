        "The use of Virtual Reality (VR) has gained wide acceptance in several scientific fields. It represents an innovative technological tool providing the experience to be immersed in a non-physical world putting on head-mounted displays that surround the users with images and sounds. To date, VR has been mainly employed in the healthcare sector for educational aims, in order to provide the learners with a new method of delivering simulations. However, its application to real clinical practice has recently generated beneficial effects for patients, especially for those who experience symptoms of psychological burden. Infertile couples often struggle with anxiety and depression which have a strong impact on life quality. Furthermore, the perspective to undergo long treatments with uncertain results and an history of failed attempts may contribute to enhance patients' negative feelings during In\u00a0Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles until Embryo Transfer (ET). The role of VR in reducing pain and anxiety during outpatient hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography and oocytes retrieval, has been recently investigated with satisfactory results in terms of reducing pain and anxiety levels. However, to date, inconclusive outcomes have been reported on pregnancy rate. Our study would discuss the existent literature on VR applied to current medical practice and infertility, proposing its beneficial impact on women anxiety during IVF cycle with ET."
