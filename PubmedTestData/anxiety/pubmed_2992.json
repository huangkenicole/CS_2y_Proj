        "We aimed to evaluate the assessment and management of epilepsy with anxiety and depression, and their clinical practice based on a survey.",
        "A cross-sectional survey of epilepsy health professionals was undertaken in Zhejiang Province using the modified International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Psychology Task Force questionnaire. We recorded the characteristics of participants and the practice of screening, referral, and treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. A total of 146 participants joined in the survey, of which 76.0% were neurologists, and 69 participants were the member of the Zhejiang Association Against Epilepsy (ZAAE).",
        "This survey revealed that almost all participants (87.7%) agreed that screening for depression and anxiety in patients with epilepsy (PWEs) was very important; however, the frequency of screening was very low (41.1% of participants screened less than 10% of patients, and 34.2% participants screened between 10% and 30% of patients). A higher frequency of screening was reported in the member group and compared with that in the non-member group (P\u202f=\u202f0.025). The main barrier to screening was the lack of time during clinic visits: 81.5% participants included screening questions as part of their clinical review. When anxiety/depression was diagnosed, the next step should be to refer patients to a psychiatrist (78.1%). No standardized procedures and lack of mental health specialists trained to assess and/or manage PWEs, were the main barriers to follow-up assessment and management. Lack of appropriately trained mental health specialists was also the main barrier to psychological treatment for depression and anxiety.",
        "This survey highlighted that epilepsy healthcare professionals in Zhejiang province agreed on the importance of screening for psychiatric comorbidities in PWEs; however, the screening and management were actually insufficient. Certain barriers to screening, referral, and treatment were presented and improvements were recommended."
