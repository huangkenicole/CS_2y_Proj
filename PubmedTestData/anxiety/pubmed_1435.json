        "Test anxiety is prevalent among adolescents and may have long-term negative consequences on their physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of test anxiety and its related attributing factors among adolescents in Shenzhen, China.",
        "A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 18, 2020 to January 12, 2021 in Shenzhen, China. Test anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Test Anxiety Scale. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess test anxiety and risk factors.",
        "In total, 7047 students aged 10 to 19 were included for this survey. The prevalence of test anxiety was found to be 46.7\u00a0%. In multivariate analysis, gender, age, frequency of feeling lonely, parents' marital status, family functioning, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, academic performance level, relationship with classmates, school bullying and Internet addiction were positive related to test anxiety.",
        "This cross-sectional design limits the establishment of causal relationships. Reporting bias and recalling bias may be possible.",
        "Our study suggested that a significant number of adolescents in Shenzhen had test anxiety symptoms. Also, we found some risk factors, which might help to provide new guidance of psychological interventions to promote adolescents' mental health."
