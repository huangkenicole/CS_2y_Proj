      "AbstractText": [
        "The increase in the working population assigned to video display terminals (VDT) has led to ever growing attention to reports on health effects. We studied musculoskeletal and visual disorders and levels of anxiety in 2 groups of VDT operators with different tasks, in order to evaluate if they could be influenced by organizational and intrinsically working factors.",
        "The study included 190 VDT operators, subdivided into 2 groups (A and B) on the basis of tasks performed and average hours/ week spent at VDT (25 vs 36), and 190 controls not assigned to VDT. Ocular and musculoskeletal subjective symptoms and objective findings were assessed for all subjects, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test was administered.",
        "For VDT operators of the 2 groups, the relationship between ocular and musculoskeletal symptoms and findings, working life (P=0.0001) and number of hours spent at the VDT (symptoms P=0.001 and P=0.0001; findings P=0.002 and P=0.007), was significant. Group B VDT operators showed significantly higher state anxiety (S-anxiety) levels vs those in Group A and controls (P=0.001); trait anxiety (T-anxiety) was significantly higher in Group B and controls vs Group A (P=0.001 and P=0.03).",
        "Our results confirm the literature data about musculoskeletal and visual disorders and, as for anxiety, seem to denote a higher relevance of factors related to labor organization vs VDT use per se."
