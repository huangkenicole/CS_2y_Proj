        "Contemporary television's portrayals of psychotherapy reveal anxieties surrounding surveillance and intimate self-disclosure in clinical and therapeutic settings. This paper analyses two twenty-first century television series featuring therapy sessions that observe and monitor mental states for prognostic purposes, engaging in what Alan Westin terms psychological surveillance: Peter Morgan's <i>The Crown</i> (2016-2023) and Phoebe Waller-Bridge's <i>Fleabag</i> (2016-2019). These shows feature contrasting modes of intimate self-disclosure-confessions and postconfessions-that emerge in psychotherapy. The confessional mode emphasises authenticity and a desire for healing. Postconfessions, on the other hand, are a parodical mode of revelation that refuse the authenticity and intimacy elicited by therapy and traditional confessional modes. Confessional discourses in <i>The Crown</i> reveal that state power, reinforced by genetic authentication, can benefit from psychological surveillance. In contrast, <i>Fleabag</i> uses postconfessional discourse to implicate the audience in the therapeutic encounter, capitalising on the increasingly decentralised self-care modalities sustained through social media, television and other audience-driven mediums."
