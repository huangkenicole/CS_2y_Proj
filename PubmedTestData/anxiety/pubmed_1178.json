      "AbstractText": [
        "We examined how much 62 adult community clients working with 26 doctoral student therapists in the 10th session of individual, open-ended, psychodynamic psychotherapy engaged in affective and cognitive-behavioral exploration preceding and following four different therapist skills (restatement, reflection of feelings, open question for thoughts, open question for feelings). Overall, therapists used more skills focused on thoughts than feelings. At the between-therapists level, therapists tended to use more skills focused on affect when antecedent client affective exploration was high. An increase in affective exploration was associated with skills focused on feelings, however, clients low in attachment anxiety showed a decrease in affective exploration in response to paraphrases (i.e., restatements and reflections of feelings). Open questions for feelings were associated with an increase in cognitive-behavioral exploration, especially for clients low in attachment anxiety. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."
