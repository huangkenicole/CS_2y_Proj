        "People living with HIV are more likely than people not living with HIV to experience Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Symptoms. Scholars have found that 19%-23% of people living with HIV experience GAD Symptoms. Current studies overwhelmingly examine individual factors among national samples and are not conducted in the US South, where HIV rates have increased significantly in recent years. Even fewer studies examine the multilevel factors that are associated with anxiety in this US South. Thus, this study examined the multilevel factors associated with anxiety symptoms in a large US Southern City. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine multilevel factors associated with anxiety symptoms among 111 people living with HIV. Two structural variables, housing satisfaction and mental health service needs and one intrapersonal variable, health quality of life, were significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety. The study points to the needs of focusing multilevel interventions not only on housing conditions, but also attention to participants' satisfaction of their housing."
