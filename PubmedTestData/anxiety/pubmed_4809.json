        "Although depression has been widely studied in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there is little information on anxiety.",
        "To detect anxiety in patients with ALS and their caregivers, comparing the diagnostic and the follow-up phases of the disease and assessing its impact on quality of life (QoL).",
        "Anxiety has been evaluated with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory in a series of 75 consecutive ALS patients and their primary caregivers. Anxiety has been related to depression, QoL, and satisfaction with life.",
        "In patients, state anxiety was significantly higher during the diagnostic phase, whilst in caregivers it was similar in the two phases. Patients' state anxiety was related to depression, shorter disease duration and lower satisfaction with life. Caregivers' state anxiety was related to their trait anxiety. Whilst in patients QoL and satisfaction with life were similar in the two phases, in caregivers there was a significant decrease of satisfaction with life in the follow-up phase.",
        "Treating neurologists should recognize that the diagnostic phase and the earlier period after the diagnosis is characterized by a high level of anxiety both in ALS patients and in their caregivers, and should propose pharmacological and psychological interventions to relieve this highly distressing disturbance."
