        "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly population and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. While senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been proposed as the principal histopathologic hallmarks of AD, the exact etiology of this disease is still far from being clearly understood. AD has been recognized as pathological consequences of complex interactions among genetic, aging, medical, life style and psychosocial factors. Recently, the roles of neuroticism personality traits in AD incidence and progression have come into focus. More specifically, increasing evidence has further shown that the trait anxiety, one major component of neuroticism predicting the individual vulnerability in response to stress, is a risk factor for AD and may correlated with various AD pathologies. In this review, we summarized recent literature on the association of trait anxiety with AD. We also discussed the possible neuroendocrinological and neurochemical mechanisms of this association, which may provide clinical implications for AD diagnosis and therapy."
