      "AbstractText": [
        "Pediatric functional abdominal pain disorders are common, costly, and disabling. Clinical anxiety is highly prevalent and is associated with increased pain and functional disability. Thus, a psychological screening process is recommended but is infrequently used in current practice.",
        "A screening process for patient-reported anxiety (Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders), functional disability (Functional Disability Inventory), and pain levels was implemented in a large gastroenterology division within a major medical center. Quality improvement methods and traditional analytic approaches were used to test the feasibility and outcomes of routine screening in patients ages 8 to 18 with abdominal pain.",
        "Screening rates increased from <1% to >80%. A total of 1291 patients who reported having abdominal pain completed the screening during the first 6 months. Clinically significant anxiety (43.1%), at least moderate disability (45%), and elevated pain (61.5%) were common in children with abdominal pain. The presence of clinically significant anxiety corresponded with higher pain and pain-related disability. Twenty-one percent of youth had clinical elevations in all 3 areas. In such instances, medical providers received an automated prompt to tailor care, including to consider a psychological referral. After the project implementation, psychological referral rates increased from 8.3 per 1000 patients to 15.2 per 1000 patients.",
        "Systematic screening for anxiety, pain, and pain-related disability as a routine part of medical care can be reliably implemented with clinically meaningful results. Future directions include examining the role of anxiety over the long-term and reducing clinician burden."
