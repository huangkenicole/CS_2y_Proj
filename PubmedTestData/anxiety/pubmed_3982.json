        "Vitiligo is a chronic disorder resulting in skin depigmentation with reported global prevalence of 1-2%. This disease is often accompanied by psychosocial distress owing to the cosmetic disfigurement associated with it. The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety among adults with vitiligo in a local tertiary hospital. In addition, this study also evaluated the association of depression and anxiety with patients' characteristics.",
        "This cross-sectional study was conducted among vitiligo patients aged 18 years and older in Hospital Klang, Selangor between October 2021 and June 2022. Assessment instruments used were Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Demographic data and clinical characteristics of vitiligo patients were recorded.",
        "Of the 100 participants, 12 (12%) and 21 (21%) had depression and anxiety, respectively. The mean depression score (HADS-depression component) was 3.4 (SD 3.4) and mean anxiety score (HADS-anxiety component) was 4.7 (SD 3.9). There were significantly higher number of patients with abnormal HADS-D score in the age group of 35-51 years (p=0.029), single status (p=0.001), with employment (p=0.014) and disease duration <2 years (p=0.004). Patients in the divorced/widowed group had a significant association with anxiety (p=0.011).",
        "The prevalence of depression was 12% while anxiety was 21% in our cohort. Vitiligo has a significant psychosocial impact, thus clinicians should actively evaluate the mental health of these patients with the use of screening tools such as HADS and provide appropriate referrals and management."
