      "AbstractText": [
        "It was aimed to determine the predictive power of family-centered care of parents of children with cancer on their unmet care needs and psychosocial problems (anxiety, depression, stress). This study was conducted as a descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional study.",
        "The study was conducted on 136 parents at a university hospital between January and September 2023, involving parents of children receiving care at the pediatric oncology clinic. Data collection instruments included an Information Form, Family Inventory of Needs Pediatric II (FINPED-II), Family-Centered Care Scale (FCCS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 28, employing Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression to assess the relationships between variables.",
        "The study revealed significant positive correlations between Family-Centered Care and Met Needs (r\u00a0=\u00a0.676, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and significant negative correlations between Met Needs and Stress scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.256, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Additionally, there were positive correlations between Anxiety and Depression scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0.700, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), Anxiety and Stress scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0.768, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and Depression and Stress scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0.835, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Family-centered care significantly predicted Met Needs (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and accounted for 47% of the variation in Anxiety, Depression, Stress, and Family Inventory of Needs scores.",
        "The findings highlight that family-centered care significantly predicts Met Needs, emphasizing its pivotal role in supporting parents of children with cancer. These findings underscore the importance of family-centered care in pediatric oncology, but also point to the need for further studies to address identified limitations and provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex healthcare dynamic."
