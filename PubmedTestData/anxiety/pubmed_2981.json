        "<b>ABSTRACT</b><b>Background:</b> Exercise training has a history of alleviating anxiety in various populations, but research into its effects on prison inmates is limited. Confinement to prison is a highly distressing event for those who have never experienced incarceration, which can dramatically increase anxiety-related symptoms and may exacerbate suicidal risk. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-seven first-time prisoners with elevated anxiety symptoms completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after a 6-week long treatment period consisting of interval exercise training (IET; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200920) or no intervention (waiting-list; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200917). Prisoners in the IET intervention had to exercise three times per week (40 min per session) under the supervision of the first and/or second author. Exercise intensity was self-monitored using the Borg's RPE-15 scale, with targets in the range 13-15 (\"somewhat hard\"-\"hard\"). <b>Results:</b> Those who received the IET intervention showed a significantly greater reduction in anxiety than prisoners in the waiting-list. The effect size for IET was of moderate-to-large magnitude (Cohen's <i>d</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.71). <b>Conclusion:</b> The authors conclude that the lower levels of anxiety reported following IET suggest that supervised exercise training is an effective coping strategy to deal with incarceration. <b>Trial registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04019171."
