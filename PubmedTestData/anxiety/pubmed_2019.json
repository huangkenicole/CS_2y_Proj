        "Anxiety is prevalent in pregnancy and predicts risk of adverse birth outcomes. Many instruments measure anxiety in pregnancy, some of which assess <i>pregnancy anxiety</i> defined as maternal concerns about a current pregnancy (e.g., baby, childbirth). The present study examined covariance among four anxiety or distress measures at two times in pregnancy and tested joint and individual effects on gestational length. We hypothesized that the common variance of the measures in each trimester would predict earlier delivery.",
        "Research staff interviewed 196 women in first and third trimester utilizing a clinical screener of anxiety severity/impairment, two instruments measuring pregnancy anxiety, and one on prenatal distress. Birth outcomes and medical risk factors were obtained from medical records after birth. Structural equation modeling fit latent factors for each trimester from the four measures. Subsequent models tested whether the latent factors predicted gestational length, and unique effects of each measure.",
        "The third-trimester pregnancy anxiety latent factor predicted shorter gestational length adjusting for mother's age, education, parity, and obstetric risk. Scores on a four-item pregnancy-specific anxiety measure (PSAS) in third trimester added uniquely to prediction of gestational length. In first trimester, scores on the clinical screener (OASIS) uniquely predicted shorter gestational length whereas the latent factor did not.",
        "These results support existing evidence indicating that pregnancy anxiety is a reliable risk factor for earlier birth. Findings point to possible screening for clinically significant anxiety symptoms in the first trimester, and pregnancy-specific anxiety thereafter to advance efforts to prevent earlier delivery.
