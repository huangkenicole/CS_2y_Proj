        "Mental health is an essential dimension of healthy aging. The number and severity of disabled elderly in China show an increasing tendency year by year. Due to their impaired ability of daily activities, reduced social participation and reduced self-care ability, they are more prone to depression and anxiety.",
        "We included 2131 individuals aged 65 and older from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS 2017-2018). We used the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7) to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. The structure of depressive and anxiety symptoms was characterized using \"Expected Influence\" and \"Bridge Expected Influence\" as centrality indices in the symptom network. Network stability was tested using a case-dropping bootstrap procedure. Finally, a Network Comparison Test (NCT) was conducted to examine whether network characteristics differed by gender.",
        "Network analysis revealed that nodes CESD3 (Felt sadness), GAD2 (Uncontrollable worry), and GAD4 (Trouble relaxing) were the primary symptoms of the anxiety-depression network. Anxiety and depression were united by the symptoms of CESD9 (Could not get going), GAD1 (Nervousness or anxiety), CESD10 (Sleep quality), and GAD4 (Trouble relaxing). Additionally, Gender did not significantly affect the network structure.",
        "Central symptoms (e.g., felt sadness, uncontrollable worry and trouble relaxing) and key bridge symptoms (e.g., could not get going, nervousness and anxiety) in the depressive and anxiety symptoms network may be used as potential targets for intervention among disabled elderly who is at risk for or suffer from depressive and anxiety symptoms."
