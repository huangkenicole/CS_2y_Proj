        "The relationship between symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome and anxiety was assessed for 68 women. The syndrome as measured by a modified version of the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, was correlated significantly with trait anxiety, as measured by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Trait anxiety was correlated with all three subtypes from the questionnaire: behavioral, psychological, and physical, most strongly for the psychological subtype. These findings suggest a role for stress-management training in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome."
