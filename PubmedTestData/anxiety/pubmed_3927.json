        "Pupil diameter is dynamically modulated by a number of factors, including emotion, motor activity, and attention. Here, pupil modulation was examined as it varies with locus of control during aversive processing. Participants could control aversive exposure either by escape (terminating the event) or avoidance (blocking the event entirely), or they had no control. Highly anxious (n\u2009=\u200919), moderately anxious (n\u2009=\u200923), and less anxious (n\u2009=\u200923) participants saw cues that signaled whether a fast button press would terminate, prevent, or not affect subsequent presentation of an aversive picture. Pupil diameter was measured throughout the cuing interval. Pupil diameter was larger when preparing to escape or avoid compared to anticipating uncontrollable exposure. All participants, regardless of reported anxiety, showed increased pupil diameter in coping, relative to uncontrollable, contexts. Results support hypotheses that pupil diameter reflects action preparation and that differences in trait anxiety do not modulate this aspect of coping behavior in healthy subjects."
