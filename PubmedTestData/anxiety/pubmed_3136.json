        "Previous research found that anxious cancer patients experience uncontrollable negative intrusive cognitions that have an impact on coping and are associated with significant psychological distress. This is the first study to examine the appraisal of intrusive cognitions in an anxious group of cancer patients.",
        "A sample of 139 anxious cancer patients was assessed for evidence of intrusive phenomena, including memories, images and thoughts. Patients completed the Response to Intrusions Questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale in relation to intrusive cognitions.",
        "Forty-eight percent (67/139) reported frequent, uncontrollable intrusive cognitions. Intrusive thoughts and images were equally as common and images were associated with increased distress and uncontrollability. A significant positive linear relationship was found between the number of intrusions and anxiety severity (P<0.05). Negative appraisal of intrusive cognitions was associated with anxiety (P<0.01) and depression severity (P<0.01), intrusion-specific distress (P<0.01), rumination (P<0.01) and cognitive avoidance (P<0.01), after controlling for intrusion frequency.",
        "Negative appraisal of intrusive cognitions plays a significant role in psychological distress and intrusion-specific distress in anxious cancer patients. Finding similarities in the types of intrusive cognitions reported by cancer patients and other anxious populations highlights the potential applicability of psychological therapies developed to reduce the frequency and impact of intrusive cognitions."
