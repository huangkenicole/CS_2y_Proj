        "More than 2.5 million people are admitted for surgery in Australia each year, and between 40 to 80% will experience moderate to high preoperative anxiety. Elevated levels of preoperative anxiety can increase the risk of postoperative complications such as pain, delayed wound healing, infection, prolonged recovery, and longer hospitalisation. Limited previous research on Virtual Reality (VR) indicates a positive impact on surgery-related anxiety and suggests that the intervention potentially leads to reduce postoperative complications.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of using VR technology for perioperative anxiety among adults undergoing elective surgery.",
        "A two-group parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted, including 150 adult patients (aged 18 years and over) undergoing elective surgery and requiring an overnight stay at a major metropolitan hospital. Eligible participants will be screened for anxiety via the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information score (APAIS). Those with moderate to severe anxiety will be randomly allocated to receive the VR session or usual care, in the preoperative holding area. Intervention participants will use a head-mounted VR device to watch and listen to a nature scene for 10 minutes.",
        "The primary outcome is perioperative anxiety measured using the visual analogue scale for anxiety (VAS-A). Secondary outcomes include stress levels (measured by saliva cortisol level and heart rate), postoperative pain, patient satisfaction with perioperative care, hospital length of stay, and VR-associated adverse events.",
        "This study will help evaluate if a brief preoperative VR session can reduce perioperative anxiety for adult elective surgical patients.",
