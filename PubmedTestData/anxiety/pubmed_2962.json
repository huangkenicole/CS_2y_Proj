        "This study relates perceived dentist behaviors to anxiety in patients during treatment and to satisfaction during the dental visit. The sample consisted of 231 adult patients, 107 men and 124 women, at a public hospital dental clinic. Immediately after treatment, patients were asked to respond to a list of 21 dentist behaviors thought to be associated with positive dentist-patient interaction. Criterion measures obtained were ratings of anxiety by patients during treatment and measures from the DVSS. None of the dentist behaviors was related to anxiety in patients in a way that would suggest that dentist behavior either reduced or increased anxiety. DAS scores obtained before treatment were the best predictor of anxiety in patients during treatment. Most of the dentist behaviors were significantly related to satisfaction in patients. Stepwise multiple regression analyses using DVSS scores as criterion variables indicated that those variables contributing most to satisfaction in patients were indicative of dentist communication that was accepting and caring. Anxiety in patients during treatment also was an important negative predictor of satisfaction. The results indicate that the dentist behaviors explored in this study were associated with satisfaction in patients, but were not clearly related to anxiety reduction."
