        "The main purpose of this study was to assess the relation between cognitive behavioral therapy and possible changes in illness perceptions and anxiety in patients diagnosed with unruptured intracranial aneurysm. An observational study of an intervention with 67 patients with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm from two medical centers in a Colombian city (n\u00a0=\u00a035 on the intervention group) was carried out. To assess changes, measurements were taken at baseline and at one-year follow-up with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Illness Perception Questionnaire, brief version, taking into account the importance of perceptions in the process of adjusting to illness and acquiring healthy life habits. Hypotheses were tested by a structural model. The results obtained from this study showed that illness perceptions were related to anxiety levels at both time points; however, the relations were stronger before cognitive behavioral therapy (\u03b2t0\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; \u03b2t1\u00a0=\u00a00.37, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be a moderator of changes in both illness perceptions and anxiety at the time of follow-up (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.31, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.26, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The structural model suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy is associated with less anxiety (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.17, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and better illness perceptions (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.35, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in patients diagnosed with unruptured intracranial aneurysms."
