        "To evaluate the feasibility of a stepped care model, and establish the effect of a tailored cognitive behavioral therapy, the Aim to Decrease Anxiety and Pain Treatment (ADAPT), compared with standard medical treatment as usual on pain-related outcomes and anxiety.",
        "Eligible patients between the ages of 9 and 14\u00a0years with functional abdominal pain disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a0139) received enhanced usual care during their medical visit to a gastroenterologist. Those that failed to respond to enhanced usual care were randomized to receive either a tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (ADAPT) plus medical treatment as usual, or medical treatment as usual only. ADAPT dose (4 sessions of pain management or 6 sessions of pain and anxiety management) was based on presence of clinically significant anxiety. Outcomes included feasibility, based on recruitment and retention rates. Response to ADAPT plus medical treatment as usual vs medical treatment as usual on pain-related outcomes and anxiety measures was also investigated using a structural equation modeling equivalent of a MANCOVA. Anxiety levels and ADAPT dose as moderators of treatment effects were also explored.",
        "Based on recruitment and retention rates, stepped care was feasible. Enhanced usual care was effective for only 8% of youth. Participants randomized to ADAPT plus medical treatment as usual showed significantly greater improvements in pain-related disability, but not pain levels, and greater improvements in anxiety symptoms compared with those randomized to medical treatment as usual only. Anxiety and ADAPT treatment dose did not moderate the effect of treatment on disability nor pain.",
        "Tailoring care based on patient need may be optimal for maximizing the use of limited psychotherapeutic resources while enhancing care.",
