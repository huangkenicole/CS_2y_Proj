        "To determine whether individual and family characteristics of children with anxiety disorders who take psychotropic medications differ from those that are unmedicated and whether there is a differential response to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).",
        "Children ages 8 to 12 years (n = 102: 18 medicated, 84 unmedicated) were recruited in a specialized outpatient clinic over a 3-year period. All had a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Comparisons were done using t-tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for discrete measures. Treatment-related changes were assessed using repeated measures analyses of variance.",
        "Medicated and unmedicated groups did not differ by age, sex, socioeconomic status, or diagnostic profile. Initial ratings of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and global functioning were comparable. Greater family dysfunction and family frustration were reported in medicated children. With treatment, both groups improved symptomatically and showed improved family functioning. Families of medicated children showed a greater reduction in frustration than families of unmedicated children, whereas unmedicated children showed greater gains in global functioning.",
        "Initial family functioning of medicated children seems to show more disturbances. Both medicated and unmedicated children can benefit from CBT. Further studies of differential treatment effects for medicated and unmedicated children are indicated."
