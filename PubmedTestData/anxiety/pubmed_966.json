        "Depersonalization is common in anxiety disorders, but little is known about factors that influence co-occurring anxiety and depersonalization.",
        "We investigated trait moderators of the relationships between state and trait anxiety and depersonalization to better understand their co-occurrence and to identify potential points of intervention.",
        "Adults recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009303) completed two computer tasks designed to increase variability in state anxiety and depersonalization as well as several self-report questionnaires.",
        "As hypothesized, anxiety positively predicted depersonalization at both a state level and trait level. Moreover, as hypothesized, the trait anxiety-trait depersonalization relationship was strengthened by greater anxiety sensitivity; distress intolerance; and negative interpretation bias for anxiety sensations, and for depersonalization sensations. None of these hypothesized trait moderators significantly strengthened the state anxiety-state depersonalization relationship.",
        "These findings suggest that, on a trait level, anxiety and depersonalization more frequently co-occur when people catastrophically misinterpret their symptoms or have lower emotional distress tolerance."
