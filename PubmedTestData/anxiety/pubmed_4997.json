        "Anxiety, stress, and fear can adversely affect the mental and physical health of people. The present study aimed to examine the association of these emotional response indicators with outcomes (recurrence, hospitalization, and mortality) in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients. A prospective cohort study was conducted between February 2020 and July 2021 in three hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The included patients (n=350) completed three questionnaires on COVID-19-related anxiety, stress, and fear. Patients with at least one emotional response indicator were assigned to the exposed group (n=157) and those without to the unexposed group (n=193). After one month of follow-up, the medical condition of all participants was determined through phone calls. Data were analyzed with logistic and multivariate regression models using STATA 9 software. The number of patients with COVID-19 recurrence in the exposed and unexposed groups was 71 (45%) and 16 (8%), respectively, and for hospitalization 79 (50%) and 16 (8%), respectively. The relative risk of recurrence and hospitalization due to COVID-19 in the exposed group was 5.62 and 6.25 higher than in the unexposed group, respectively (P<0.001 for both). The results of regression analysis showed that underlying diseases were not significantly associated with recurrence and hospitalization. The total number of deaths was six, all of which were in the exposed group. Given the greater risk of recurrence and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients with anxiety, stress, or fear, there is a need to devise and implement appropriate strategies to prevent and manage mental disorders."
