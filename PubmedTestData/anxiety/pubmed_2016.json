        "It is recognized that pre-operative anxiety can have adverse effects on the course and outcome of surgery and there is a considerable amount of research into the influences of interventions for pre-operative anxiety on a number of post-operative variables. However, little attention has been paid to the potential influences of treatments on intra-operative variables, most notably on the facilitation of anaesthesia. The present study examined the impact of a brief relaxation procedure on anaesthesia in comparison to attention-control and no-treatment control procedures. A sample of 21 patients about to undergo anaesthesia for day-case surgery were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. It was found that the relaxation treatment significantly reduced pre-operative anxiety as measured by the state scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983). This reduction was reflected in physiological indicators of anxiety. Both the relaxation group and the attention-control group required significantly less time to induce anaesthesia and less of the anaesthetic agent used to maintain anaesthesia. The relaxation group also scored significantly lower than the no-treatment control group on an anaesthetist's rating of difficulty of maintenance of anaesthesia. Whilst the relaxation treatment appeared to have no advantages over the attention-control procedure in terms of anaesthetic requirements, the latter treatment did not reduce anxiety and showed no benefit over the no-treatment control condition in terms of an anaesthetist's rating of difficulty of maintenance of anaesthesia. In addition, following recovery the relaxation subjects reported more favourable perceptions of their treatment than the attention-control subjects."
