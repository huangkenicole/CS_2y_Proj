        "To explore the experiences of patients with non-cardiac chest pain and cardiac anxiety regarding participation in an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program.",
        "Non-cardiac chest pain is common and leads to cardiac anxiety. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy may be a possible option to decrease cardiac anxiety in these patients. We have recently evaluated the effect of an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program on cardiac anxiety.",
        "An inductive qualitative study using content analysis and the COREQ checklist.",
        "Semi-structured interviews with 16 Swedish patients, who had participated in the internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program.",
        "Three categories were found. The first, 'Driving factors for participation in the internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program' described the impact of pain on their lives and struggle that led them to participating in the program. The second, 'The program as a catalyst' described that the program was helpful, trustworthy and useful and the last category, 'Learning to live with chest pain' described the program as a tool for gaining the strength and skills to live a normal life despite chest pain.",
        "The program was experienced as an opportunity to return to a normal life. The program was perceived as helpful, trustworthy and useful, which helped the participants challenge their fear of chest pain and death, and gain strength and new insights into their ability to live a normal life.",
        "A tailored internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program delivered by a nurse therapist with clinical experience of the patient group is important to improve cardiac anxiety.",
        "Patients or the general public were not involved in the design, analysis or interpretation of the data of this study, but two patients with experience of non-cardiac chest pain were involved in the development of the pilot study.",
