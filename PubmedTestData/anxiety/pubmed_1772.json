        "Fear and/or anxiety about pain is a useful construct, in both theoretical and clinical terms. This article describes the development and refinement of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ), which exists in its most current form as the FPQ-III. Factor analytic refinement resulted in a 30-item FPQ-III which consists of Severe Pain, Minor Pain, and Medical Pain subscales. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the FPQ-III were found to be good. Four studies are presented, including normative data for samples of inpatient chronic pain patients, general medical outpatients, and unselected undergraduates. High fear of pain individuals had greater avoidance/escape from a pain-relevant Behavioral Avoidance Test with Video, relative to their low fear counterparts, suggesting predictive validity. Chronic pain patients reported the greatest fear of severe pain. Directions for future research with the FPQ-III are discussed, along with general comments about the relation of fear and anxiety to pain."
