        "The 62-channel EEG was recorded in control (CI, n = 21) and high anxiety (HA, n = 18) individuals under emotionally neutral (eyes closed, eyes open, and neutral videoclip) as well as under emotionally positive and aversive arousal conditions elicited by affective videoclips. In the present study the first three experimental conditions (eyes closed--eyes open--viewing emotionally neutral films) modeled increasing non-emotional arousal. Findings from this continuum show that in the HA individuals the lowest level of tonic arousal (eyes closed) was associated with stronger right-sided parietotemporal theta1 and beta1 activity. Group differences during cortical arousal increased by sensory stimulation (eyes open, neutral clips presentation) were marked only by persisting favored right hemisphere beta1 activity in high anxiety individuals. Under aversive arousal condition, attended by high intensity experience of emotions of anger, fear, disgust and anxiety, the HA subjects selectively desynchronized the right parietotemporal beta1 power which was initially higher in the control conditions. The obtained findings allow to suggest that peculiarities of right-sided parietotemporal EEG theta1 and beta1 activity in HA individuals under studied emotionally neutral and aversive arousal conditions point to overactivated withdrawal system in \"checking\" and \"control\" modes."
