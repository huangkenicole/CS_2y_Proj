        "The aim of this study was to develop short forms of the STAI-Y trait and state scales and associated norms suitable for the screening of anxiety in elderly populations.",
        "This study was based on population-based cohorts of older persons from two epidemiological French studies that each included one subscale of the STAI-Y, i.e. state and trait anxiety scales. For both scales, the most discriminative items were retained and their factorial structure was examined using principal components analysis. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was estimated and cut-offs and norms were computed.",
        "A 10-item STAI-Y version produced scores similar to those obtained with the full form of the STAI-Y. The factorial structure of the shortened form is comparable to that of the full scales. Results showed good internal consistency (alpha coefficients were 0.92 and 0.85 for short STAI-Y state and trait scales, respectively). Moreover, both short STAI-Y state and trait scales correctly classified 88% of the participants using a cut-off point of 23. Norms for both short trait and state anxiety scales are provided according to age, gender, educational level and depressive symptoms.",
        "Both shortened scales have similar factorial structure and internal consistency to the longer scales and classify anxious/non-anxious elderly with acceptable accuracy. The shorter form is likely to be more acceptable to elderly persons through reduction of fatigue effects."
