      "AbstractText": [
        "This era of neurobiological advances challenges psychiatric nurses to develop innovative practice models that address the needs of clients with anxiety disorders. Technological discoveries and molecular and genetic research provide a wealth of evidence-based data that serve as the basis of symptom management, prevention, and health promotion and maintenance in clients experiencing anxiety disorders. This article provides an overview of current data-based studies and conceptual models of various anxiety disorders and their key components. Underpinnings include the interrelationship among neurotransmitter systems, neuroendocrinological processes, and neuroanatomical structures and their role in mediating stress, normal anxiety, and various anxiety disorders. Treatment considerations are also an integral part of this article. The discussion of pharmacologic and nonpharmacological interventions reflect dysregulation of intricate neurobiologic processes and concurrent behaviors and individual client needs."
