        "The traditional notion that a family is built around and based on blood or genetic ties is challenged when assisted human reproduction utilizing donor gametes is used. A focus on the family--in contrast to the individual--requires from medicine an extension of thinking in which a model that incorporates treating infertility and building a family becomes the norm. Such a model will require that attention is given to the psychological and social needs of the would-be parents, thus enabling them to approach their family building with confidence. This confidence is expected to carry through to their sharing with their offspring the nature of their family building and thus avoid the stigma that leads to secrecy. Research relating to dimensions of family building when donor insemination has been used is reviewed. The impact of professional attitudes, along with the policies adopted by governments concerning access to genetic information for offspring, significantly influences the families built with assistance of donor gametes or embryos. The evolution of professional thinking in this area is reviewed, along with the increasing involvement of governments."
