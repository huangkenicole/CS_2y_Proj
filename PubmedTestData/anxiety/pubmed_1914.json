        "Building a friendship with peers is an important developmental task. However, peer victimization and social anxiety are among the most disturbing problems and have impaired adolescents' adaptive development. A total of 942 adolescents completed the survey. The results showed that peer victimization was related to social anxiety and that this effect was mediated by cognitive flexibility and moderated by affect intensity. Specifically, the damage of peer victimization and social anxiety was aggrevated for those with high levels of affect intensity. The current study provides evidence for the association between peer victimization and social anxiety. It contributes to the literature by clarifying the equivocal findings and uncovering the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between peer victimization and social anxiety. In the future, researchers and teachers should pay attention to adolescents' peer social status as early as possible, especially for adolescents with higher levels of affect intensity."
