        "A brief outline of some of the diagnostic systems for classifying the anxiety disorders are presented. This includes historical diagnoses, as well as systems of the recent past and those in current use. Some of the research issues and results leading to these diagnostic systems have been considered, as well as the way that a diagnostic system could have adverse effects in limiting research and the understanding of the anxiety disorders and their interplay, one with another. Finally a revised diagnostic system for the anxiety disorders is introduced, which, it is suggested, will overcome some of the serious criticisms of the current diagnostic systems."
