        "Evaluate for perturbed signaling pathways associated with subgroups of patients with low versus high levels of state anxiety. These pathways were compared to the pathways identified across eight network pharmacology studies of the anxiolytic effect(s) of a variety of compounds.",
        "Adult outpatients had a diagnosis of breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer; had received chemotherapy within the preceding four weeks; and were scheduled to receive at least two additional cycles of chemotherapy. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct anxiety profiles based on Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory scores that were obtained six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. Blood samples were processed using RNA sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq sample, n = 244) and microarray (i.e., microarray sample; n = 256) technologies. Pathway perturbations were assessed using pathway impact analysis. Fisher's combined probability method was used to combine test results using a false discovery rate of 0.01.",
        "In the RNA-seq sample, 62.3% and 37.7% of the patients were in the low- and high-anxiety classes, respectively. In the microarray sample, 61.3% and 38.7% were in the low and high-anxiety classes, respectively. Forty-one perturbed signaling pathways were identified. Eight of these pathways were common to those identified in the network pharmacology studies.",
        "Findings increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie anxiety in patients receiving chemotherapy. This study provides initial insights into how anxiety in patients with cancer may share common mechanisms with anxiety in patients with other clinical conditions."
