        "This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed toward evaluating the effectiveness of nurse-led educational interventions in anxiety management in cancer survivors.",
        "The electronic databases including Embase, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ERIC and manual search were subjected to a systematic search from 2000 to March 2021. A systematic review and\u00a0meta-analysis\u00a0was\u00a0conducted.",
        "A total of 1028 studies were identified through five electronic databases and manual search. Overall, 42 studies were included in this systematic review. In addition, 32 included studies also investigated the interventional effects in management of depression. Therefore, depression was set as the secondary outcome. The meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials with 2936 participants showed that nurse-led educational interventions decreased cancer survivors' anxiety with a moderate effect size (ES: - 0.25; 95% CI, - 0.35 to - 0.15, p = 0.03). The meta-analysis of 15 studies with 1906 participants indicated that nurse-led educational interventions decreased cancer survivors' depression with a moderate effect size (ES: - 0.33; 95% CI, - 0.45 to - 0.21, p = 0.09).",
        "Evidence supports the effectiveness of nurse-led educational interventions for reducing anxiety and depression in cancer survivors. An individual approach, the combination of face-to-face interventions and materials, a duration of 6 months, and a maximum of 60 min for each session could be considered in the future when developing educational interventions to manage anxiety."
