        "Although perinatal anxiety is common in birthing and nonbirthing parents, little is known about the mental health or educational needs of nonbirthing parents during the perinatal period and whether perinatal anxiety in the birthing parent is associated with nonbirthing parent educational preferences.",
        "This study aimed to examine the desired digital perinatal educational preferences of nonbirthing parents and whether these preferences differed by (1) endorsement of high parenthood-related anxiety in the nonbirthing partner and (2) mental health of the birthing parent (including both identified mental health conditions and presence of pregnancy-related anxiety).",
        "In this cross-sectional study, nonbirthing and birthing parents using Maven, a digital perinatal health platform, selected the areas in which they wanted education or support from a list of options. In addition, the participants reported their experience of parenthood or pregnancy-related anxiety through a 5-item Likert scale in response to the prompt, \"On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), how anxious are you feeling about parenthood or pregnancy?\" High parenthood or pregnancy-related anxiety was defined as being very (scale: 4) or extremely (scale: 5) anxious. Furthermore, birthing parents reported whether they had a current or previous mood disorder, but this information was not reported by nonbirthing parents. Survey responses for birthing and nonbirthing parents were linked through the digital platform. Descriptive analyses were used to assess nonbirthing parent demographics and perinatal support interests, stratified by high parenthood-related anxiety, high pregnancy-related anxiety in their partner, and perinatal mood disorders or high pregnancy-related anxiety in their partner.",
        "Among 382 nonbirthing parents, most (85.6%) desired to receive digital support during their partner's pregnancy: the most commonly endorsed support interests were infant care (327 [85.6%]) and understanding their partner's emotional (313 [81.9%]) or physical (294 [77.0%]) experience during pregnancy. Overall, 355 nonbirthing parents (93.9%) endorsed any parenthood-related anxiety, and 63 nonbirthing parents (16.5%) were categorized as having high parenthood-related anxiety. Those with high parenthood-related anxiety were more likely to desire digital support for each topic. Among birthing parents, 124 (32.4%) had a mental health condition, and 45 (11.8%) had high pregnancy-related anxiety. When nonbirthing parents were stratified by the presence of their partner having a mental health condition or high pregnancy-related anxiety alone, no difference in desired perinatal education was identified. Although nonbirthing parents had higher rates of high parenthood-related anxiety if the birthing parent reported high pregnancy anxiety (17 [27.0%] vs 28 [8.8%]; P<.001), no difference was found with other conditions within the mental health composite.",
        "In this cross-sectional study, many nonbirthing parents who engaged with a perinatal digital platform desired education on their or their partner's emotional health during the perinatal period, and most endorsed parenthood-related anxiety. Our findings suggest that perinatal mental health support is needed for nearly all parents and that nonbirthing parents who use digital health platforms are amenable to receiving comprehensive perinatal education via these platforms."
