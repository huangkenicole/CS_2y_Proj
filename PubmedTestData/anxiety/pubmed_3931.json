        "Mental health issues increased during the COVID - 19 pandemic, especially among children. Our past research efforts found that surveillance data can address a variety of health concerns; that personal psychological awareness impacted ability to cope, and mental health outcomes were improved when survivors were triaged to mental health countermeasures. To build upon our public health efforts, we wanted to see if increased screen time due to remote learning caused by the pandemic influenced school aged children's mental health.",
        "With the hypothesis that excessive time spent isolated during remote learning increased the amount of mental health events in children, we conducted a public health surveillance project on actual diagnoses rather than just symptoms, controlling for historical mental health and emotional disorders.",
        "The entire cohort of children aged 6 to 17 years were studied over time before and during the pandemic for their medically diagnosed mental health and emotional outcomes by the amount of pandemic induced social isolation.",
        "After controlling for historical diagnoses and the rate of COVID - 19, the effect of pandemic - induced social isolation had a linear increase on the amount of anxiety, resulting in a 4-fold increase in pandemic social isolation - induced anxiety."
