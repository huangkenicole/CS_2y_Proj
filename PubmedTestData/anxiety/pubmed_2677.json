        "The success of adaptation of students to conditions of educational process in Medical University is determined by complex of accompanying socio-psychological factors. The level of personal anxiety determines severity of impact of these factors on psychosomatic state of student. The high level of anxiety among students in conditions of educating in Medical University can significantly and multi-componently impact their physical organism, success in teaching and social well-being. The purpose of the study is to determine prevalence of high levels of anxiety and their impact on health and social well-being of students of different genders, periods of study on budgetary and commercial basis. There is significant prevalence of high levels of personal anxiety among students of first year of education (57.0%), which tends to increase by fourth year (75.5%). The increased anxiety has significant impact on morbidity (correlation with anxiety levels \u03c4=0.69 and \u03c4=0.40 for men and women, respectively) and social well-being of students, their behavior and lifestyle. The female students are the most affected by anxiety factor. The belonging of students with high level of anxiety to budget or commercial group determines specificity their response to conditions of education in the Medical University. The obtained results should be used to improve efficiency of adaptation and psychological support of students in the process of education in Medical University. The high level of anxiety in students should be taken into account in preventive activities of preserving health of students as separate factor, impacting similarly with strong health risk factor on their physical organism and social well-being, considering gender and period of study on budgetary or commercial basis."
