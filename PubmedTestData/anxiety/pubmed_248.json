        "This study presents the effects of general psychologic characteristics on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) anxieties and sexual behaviour of adolescents. To this end, data were collected in a complex interview and subsequently subjected to a linear structural model analysis. The questioned adolescents were divided into one representative group (n = 256) and a second group who had participated in a voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test (n = 45). AIDS anxieties have to be divided into two independent dimensions: first, a relatively stable feeling of AIDS anxiety (trait anxiety) and second, a manifest personal anxiety toward AIDS experienced in a concrete situation (state anxiety). A principal component analysis of the primary data brought forth four variables described as depression/general anxiety, extent of phobic anxieties, compulsion, and tendency to self-consciousness. The present study reveals that the AIDS trait anxiety is more pronounced among those subjects who are not well informed about AIDS, who tend to phobic anxieties, and who observe themselves in a particularly intensive manner. The AIDS state anxiety however, is stronger among subjects who are well informed about AIDS, have sexual experience, and observe themselves intensively. Among the participants who took part in the HIV test, there were more individuals with a higher manifest AIDS anxiety and stronger tendency to depression. The percentage of adolescents who were indeed exposed to a possible risk of getting infected was relatively low. Generally speaking, those young people who are depressed, anxious, and sexually active agreed more easily to take the test than young people with a pronounced phobia toward the risk of infection and less sexual experience. As a conclusion, we can state that those adolescents with less sexual experience tend to externalize their general sexual anxieties in the form of concrete AIDS anxieties."
