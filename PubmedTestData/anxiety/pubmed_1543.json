        "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and mental health problems are interrelated. However, less is known about this relationship in incarcerated women and how self-esteem impacts this relationship.",
        "To investigate the relationship between ACEs and mental health problems (traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety) in incarcerated women with opioid use disorder (OUD) and, the possible role of self-esteem as a mediator of the relationship.",
        "Incarcerated women (N\u00a0=\u00a0500) were randomly selected from eight Kentucky jails, screened for OUD, and interviewed by research staff.",
        "Regression analyses and mediation models were used to examine the relationship between ACEs, mental health, and self-esteem.",
        "ACEs were positively correlated with present mental health problems (traumatic stress, r\u00a0=\u00a00.407, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; depression, r\u00a0=\u00a00.177, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; and anxiety, r\u00a0=\u00a00.213, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and negatively correlated with current self-esteem (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.241, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Linear regression analyses established that ACEs and self-esteem were significantly related to all three mental health variables of interest. Additionally, self-esteem mediated the relationship between ACEs and mental health.",
        "This study shows that incarcerated women's experiences with ACEs are significantly related to poor mental health. Self-esteem plays a critical role in this relationship."
