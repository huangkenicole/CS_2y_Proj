        "The study's aims were (i) to identify the prevalence of health anxiety (HA) among the elderly in urban community healthcare centers and (ii) to determine whether HA is related to social, physical, or psychological factors.",
        "It is a population-based observational study.",
        "Data were collected from urban community healthcare centers in Chengdu, China, from October 2016 to March 2017.",
        "A total of 893 participants aged \u2265 60 years.",
        "The Short HA Inventory was used for HA assessment. Mental health status was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Inventory and Mini-Mental State Examination. Other information was collected through face-to-face interviews. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0.",
        "The point prevalence rate of HA was 9.53% (95%CI = 6.99%-12.07%). The number of chronic diseases was a positive factor associated with HA in a regression analysis. As compared with participants without chronic diseases, people with one (OR = 1.796; 95%CI = 0.546-5.909), two (OR = 2.922; 95%CI = 0.897-9.511), and three chronic diseases (OR = 6.448; 95%CI = 2.147-19.363) had higher odds of suffering from HA.",
        "The prevalence of HA was high in the elderly population. Certain physical conditions, such as having chronic diseases, were significant impact factors. More attention should be paid to the situation of HA in this population."
