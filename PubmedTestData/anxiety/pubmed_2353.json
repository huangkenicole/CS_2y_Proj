        "To explore the effect of spiritual well-being on the symptom experience of patients with cancer.",
        "This is a cross-sectional survey that enrolled 459 patients with cancer from three large hospitals in Jordan in 2018. Participants completed questionnaires related to demographic data, spiritual well-being, and symptom experience. Additional information was obtained from the medical record review. We then conducted multiple regression to evaluate if spiritual well-being predicts the patients' reported symptom distress.",
        "Patients reported thirty-six symptoms. Of which 15 have a prevalence of more than 30%. Fatigue was the most prevalent symptom (n\u2009=\u2009282, 61.4%), followed by pain (n\u2009=\u2009243, 52.9%) and anxiety (n\u2009=\u2009230, 50.1%). Spiritual well-being predicted 7.1% of the total variance in patients' symptom distress (F, 19.650; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Additional predictors were gender, education level, having a problem covering the treatment cost, family cancer history, and whether taking a complementary treatment or not.",
        "Patients with cancer experience multiple symptoms related to the disease and its treatment. Improving patients' spiritual well-being through an increased sense of meaning and peace can improve cancer symptom experience by decreasing symptom distress. In general, hospitals in Jordan focus on direct symptom management and do not look after patients' spiritual needs. Raising awareness about the importance of patients' spiritual well-being and providing appropriate spiritual assessment and interventions to patients with spiritual distress can improve patients' symptom experience."
