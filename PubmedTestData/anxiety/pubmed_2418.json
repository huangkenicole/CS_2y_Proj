        "Patient knowledge about arthritis and risks, benefits, and outcomes of joint arthroplasty in developing countries is unknown. We evaluated the effectiveness of a preoperative class on improving knowledge and decreasing anxiety during a surgical mission trip offering total joint arthroplasty.",
        "A team of US health care providers taught a preoperative class to 41 patients selected for total joint arthroplasty during a surgical mission trip to Guyana. Participants completed a 32-point survey about arthritis; indications, risks, and benefits of joint arthroplasty; and postoperative, in-patient rehabilitation expectations. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure participant anxiety. Participants completed identical surveys before and after class. Matched-pairs Student t tests were used to compare means between preclass and postclass surveys. Significance was accepted at P < .05.",
        "Seventy-eight percent of patients (31 of 41) scored less than 12 of 32 possible points (40%) on the preclass knowledge questionnaire. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation knowledge scores improved from 14.0 \u00b1 4.5 before the class to 16.5 \u00b1 6.5 after the class (P\u00a0= .008). Anxiety scores (n\u00a0= 33) improved from 35 \u00b1 13 before the class to 33 \u00b1 12 after the class (P\u00a0= .047).",
        "On this surgical mission trip, underserved patients' knowledge about total joint arthroplasty increased only modestly after taking a preoperative class. Greater understanding of how to educate patients and reduce their anxiety on medical missions is needed."
