        "As the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) repeated, the prevention and treatment will be normalized in a period. \"Large number of patients\" and \" Turnover quickly\" of the day surgery ward greatly increased the difficulty of policy formulation and implementation. The normalization also had a huge negative psychological impact on patients/family members. This study aims to introduce effective epidemic prevention and control measures in day surgery wards, and to clarify the influencing factors of anxiety and subjective discomfort of patients and their families during the normalization of COVID-19.",
        "To prepare for normalization of epidemic, research discuss improvements in the management of staff, environment, process. A total of 148 patients admitted to West China Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022 and their relatives were asked to complete a questionnaire effectively. Using the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Social Support Rating Scale and Subjective Units of Distress scales to analyze anxiety and its risk factors.",
        "Under normalized control measures, no staff was infected. The subjective discomfort score was higher in people with lower body mass index (BMI). Young and high social support score were risk factors for anxiety (P < .05), and social support was positively correlated with anxiety.",
        "The normalization of epidemic is an inevitable trend in a period. A stable and safe medical environment needs to fully eliminate the policy defects, to fit the people and focus on mental health of the people. For patients/family members, who are younger,a lower BMI and higher social support should be attention more."
