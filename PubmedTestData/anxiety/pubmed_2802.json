        "Anxiety and depression among physicians and nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA are not well described and their modifiable causes are poorly understood.",
        "We conducted a cross-sectional survey of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) among physicians and nurses in two US healthcare systems in June through September 2020; participation rate was 5-10%. We described features of work as well as their perceptions and associated concerns in relation to the risk of anxiety and depression, while controlling for health history via regression and path analyses.",
        "About a third of 684 nurses and 185 physicians surveyed showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, and the excess of symptoms of mood disorders was particularly prominent in nurses. The belief that one was infected was a dominant correlate of both anxiety and depression. This belief was more associated with history of symptoms of pneumonia than the contact with COVID-19 diagnosed patients. Factors found to be associated with reduced anxiety and depression in this working environment were having confidence in the competent use of and access to personal protective equipment, maintaining usual working hours, being surrounded by colleagues who were both sufficient in numbers and not stressed, and the support of immediate family and religious communities. Involvement in aerosol-generating procedures with infected patients was linked with lower depression in nurses but higher among physicians. Likewise, the setting of recent patient encounters affected risk of anxiety and depression differently for physicians and nurses.",
        "Our findings may help develop mitigation measures and underscore the need to help nurses and physicians bear the psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar events in the future."
