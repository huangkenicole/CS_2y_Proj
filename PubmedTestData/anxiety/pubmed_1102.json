        "This study compared self-reported speech anxiety experienced by female prisoners before and after attending a special program within a state vocational facility. With high scores on the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker, 13 women volunteers were treated in a program incorporating various techniques including systematic desensitization, cognitive restructuring, skills training, and shaping. These components were presented in six 2-hr. sessions. Pre- and posttreatment comparisons showed a significant decrease in speech anxiety. Discussion focuses on basic characteristics relevant to this sample (short attention span and low reading levels) and limitations of an institutional nature such as excessive noise, lack of privacy, and restrictions on possession of study materials."
