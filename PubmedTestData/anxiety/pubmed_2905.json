      "AbstractText": [
        "The stability of anxiety and depression during pregnancy and the impact on women and offspring has been recognized, yet the distinction of impact between them remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the trajectory of prenatal anxiety and depression and their coexistence, as well as to examine the potential variations in pregnancy outcomes and fetal/neonatal growth development.",
        "At baseline (11-13<sup>+6</sup> weeks), women were recruited and subsequently monitored in the second (16-20<sup>+6</sup> weeks) and third (28-31<sup>+6</sup> weeks) trimesters. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In the second (16-20<sup>+6</sup> weeks), third (28-31<sup>+6</sup> weeks), and prenatal period (37-40<sup>+6</sup> weeks), fetal growth was assessed by ultrasound scans. The joint trajectory model was used to determine the trajectory groups of depressive/anxiety dominant or coexistence. Comparisons of fetal/neonatal growth between groups were conducted using analysis of covariance and a multilevel model.",
        "A total of 457 pregnant women were finally included. Four trajectory groups were identified: none-negative emotion (n\u00a0=\u00a0190, 41.6\u00a0%), anxiety dominant (n\u00a0=\u00a0195, 42.6\u00a0%), depression dominant (n\u00a0=\u00a033, 7.2\u00a0%), and anxiety and depression coexistence (n\u00a0=\u00a039, 8.6\u00a0%). There were significant differences in the antenatal abdominal circumference (335.44 vs 333.92 vs 330.82 vs 325.13\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) of fetuses and the birth length (50.14 vs 50.03 vs 49.91 vs 49.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) of newborns among four groups, showing a clear decreasing trend. Anxiety and depression coexistence displayed a notable and statistically significant difference when compared to the other groups and had a lower increase of fetal abdominal circumference (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-8.91, 95%CI: -16.15, -1.67, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) after controlling for confounding factors. Anxiety and depression dominant groups found no difference in fetal/neonatal growth.",
        "The more severe the negative emotional state of mothers, the more restricted their offspring's development, especially in terms of fetal abdominal circumference and birth length. The impact of anxiety or depressive symptoms does not show a pronounced difference. However, what is noteworthy is the tendency and evident impact on offspring development when anxiety and depression coexistence work synergistically. As a result, healthcare professionals should place greater emphasis on addressing anxiety and depression in expectant mothers, particularly among those experiencing anxiety and depression coexisting symptoms."
