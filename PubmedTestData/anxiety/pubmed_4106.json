        "Poor sleep quality might be a potentially modifiable predictor of prognosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Anxiety and depression symptoms are highly prevalent in these patients. Whether anxiety and depression symptoms are risk factors for poor sleep quality in Chinese patients with CHD is unclear. This study is intended to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality in Chinese patients with CHD and its associations with anxiety and depression symptoms, and to explore whether sex, obesity and CHD type modify these associations. Three hundred and forty-eight participants were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, >7 was defined as poor sleep quality) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to assess sleep quality and psychological symptoms. 47.1% of the participants had poor sleep quality. Logistic regression analysis showed that poor sleep quality was independently associated with anxiety and depression symptoms adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. However, adjusted for anxiety symptoms, poor sleep quality was no longer associated with depression symptoms. Subgroup and interaction analysis showed that poor sleep quality was associated with markedly higher HADS anxiety and depression scores among patients with stable angina than those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These findings suggest that poor sleep quality was associated with both anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese patients with CHD. However, in the case of concurrent anxiety and depression, anxiety was the main related factor of a high prevalence of poor sleep quality. The association between poor sleep quality and psychological symptoms was influenced by CHD type."
