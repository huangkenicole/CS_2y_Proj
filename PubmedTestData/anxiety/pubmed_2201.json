        "Anxious depression is a common subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with adverse outcomes and severely impaired social function. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between child maltreatment, family functioning, social support, interpersonal problems, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxious depression.",
        "Data were collected from 809 MDD patients. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17), Family Assessment Device (FAD), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Interpersonal Relationship Integrative Diagnostic Scale (IRIDS), and Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS) were administered and recorded. Anxious depression was defined as an anxiety/somatization factor score\u00a0\u2265\u00a07 on the HAMD-17. Chi-squared tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, distance correlations, and structural equation models were used for data analysis.",
        "Two-fifths of MDD patients had comorbid anxiety, and there were significant differences in child maltreatment, family functioning, social support, interpersonal problems, and dysfunctional attitudes between groups. Of these factors, interpersonal relationships were most related to anxiety in MDD patients, and dysfunctional attitudes mediated the relationship between interpersonal relationships and anxiety in MDD patients.",
        "This study used cross-sectional data with no further follow-up to assess patient outcomes. This study did not include information about pharmacological treatments. A larger sample size is needed to validate the results.",
        "Psychosocial factors were significantly associated with anxious depression. Interpersonal relationships and dysfunctional attitudes have a direct effect on anxious depression, and interpersonal relationships also mediate the effects of anxious depression via dysfunctional attitudes."
