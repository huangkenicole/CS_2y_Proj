        "A beautiful face, lithe body, and appealing genitalia are alluring in Western Society. Plastic surgery to repair a defect or improve sexual appeal often elicits the patient's anxiety as well as excitement. The health care professional's empathic and therapeutic support is essential to improving post surgical recovery. The effectiveness of outcome and patient satisfaction often rest on how well the surgery meets the patient's needs. Anxiety is a major factor that influences whether patients have realistic expectations for surgery and whether the patient needs constant reassurance and support from the nurse. The nurse needs to use scientific knowledge and strategies for screening, assessment, and management of anxious patients. Depending on their level of anxiety, patients benefit from diverse nursing interventions to treat anxiety, provide resources, and recommend referrals for those with anxiety disorders."
