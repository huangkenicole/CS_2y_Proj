        "Behaviour of female C57BL/6J strain mice was studied in the elevated plus-maze and Porsolt's tests after either long-lasting individual housing or keeping with daily shifting group-housed females (social instability). After 2-3 months, an increased level of anxiety in the individually housed females was revealed in the elevated plus-maze. However, in 3 months the least passive behaviour in the Porsolt's was in the individually housed females. No changes were found in behaviour of females individually housed at 3 weeks of age for 4 months. Also, females with preliminary social contacts with males and following individual housing for one month had not any abnormalities in the used behavioural tests. Social instability conditions did not significantly influence the females' plus-maze behaviour, but decreased the passive behaviour in the Porsolt's test."
