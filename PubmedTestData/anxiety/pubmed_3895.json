        "The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of three COVID-19-related variables (i.e., risk perception, knowledge, and behaviour) on four indices of pandemic-related mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hopelessness). In total, 337 participants completed four self-report questionnaires: selected subscales of the World Health Organisation's COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Tool, UCLA Loneliness Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modelling was used to compare three models of the potential role (predictor or moderator/mediator) that the three abovementioned COVID-19-related variables could play in psychological wellbeing. The results showed high levels of psychological distress among the current sample. Generally, better knowledge of COVID-19 and engaging in protective behaviours were found to be related to lower levels of psychological distress, whereas increased risk perception was found to be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. It was also found that behaviour mediated the effect of knowledge on psychological wellbeing, suggesting that while publicising information about COVID-19 remains necessary, providing the public with a means to engage in protective behaviours is central for promoting psychological wellbeing."
