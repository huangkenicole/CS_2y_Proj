        "This correlational study describes levels of hope and states of anxiety of individual family members of critically ill patients and investigates the relationship between hope and state of anxiety. Forty-four family members of critically ill patients participated in the study and revealed a high level of hope and a high level of anxiety within 72 hours of the patient's hospitalization, regardless of personal or situational characteristics. Hope and anxiety were not significantly related in this sample; themes of hope focused on past and present experiences, whereas anxiety centered on death of the loved one. Participants looked to the past, recalling happy times, and to the future, in relation to goals and potential. Family members acknowledged feeling secure, self-confident, and steady, and were able to make decisions because they were not confused about the situation. Nurses are challenged to inspire the family's hope and decrease their anxiety."
