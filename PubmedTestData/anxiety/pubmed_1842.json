        "The personality dimension neuroticism and difficulties in emotional regulation (ER) are two variables closely related to the onset, course, and maintenance of emotional disorders (EDs). The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a treatment specifically designed to address neuroticism by training in adaptive ER skills and has been shown to be effective in reducing difficulties in ER. However, the specific impact of these variables on treatment outcomes is not entirely clear. The aim of the present study was to explore the moderating role of neuroticism and difficulties in ER regarding the evolution of depressive and anxiety symptoms and quality of life.",
        "This secondary study included 140 participants diagnosed with EDs, who received the UP in group format as part of an RCT being conducted in different Spanish Public Mental Health Units.",
        "The results of this study found that high scores in neuroticism and difficulties in ER were associated with greater severity of depression and anxiety symptomatology, and with poorer quality of life. In addition, difficulties in ER moderated the efficacy of UP regarding anxiety symptoms, and quality of life. No moderating effects were found for depression (p\u00a0>\u00a00.5).",
        "We only evaluated two moderators that may influence UP effectivenes; other key moderators should be analyzed in future.",
        "The identification of specific moderators affecting transdiagnostic interventions outcomes will allow the development of personalized interventions and provide useful information to improve the psychopathology and well-being of people with EDs."
