        "The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between anxious/depressive symptoms and cell-mediated immunity (Delayed-type Hypersensitivity skin test, DTH) in subjects devoid of any psychiatric morbidity. Forty-eight females and twenty-four males were studied, ages ranging 21-60. These subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for evaluation of depressive symptoms and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAIX1, STAIX2) for evaluation of anxious symptoms; subsequently on the same day they were tested for DTH using the Multitest CMI system (Merieux Institute, France). Subjects were split into three groups using the 33rd and 66th percentiles of DTH response (cumulative induration diameter). In females, subjects with larger DTH response (DTH > 8 mm) had significantly lower levels of \"state\" anxiety (scores at STAIX1; Kruskall-Wallis test, P = .04). On the contrary, no differences were observed between groups considering scores obtained by males at self-evaluation rating scales. Our data seem to support the hypothesis that activity of immune system as measured by DTH skin test may be influenced by affective status in the context of everyday life."
