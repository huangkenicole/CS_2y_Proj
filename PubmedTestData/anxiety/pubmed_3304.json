        "Imagery rescripting (ImRS), i.e. changing intrusive mental images in imagery, is increasingly recognized as a helpful therapy technique. In ImRS exercises, patients sometimes suggest taking violent revenge on perpetrators. However, it is unclear whether vengeful phantasies can be particularly helpful in giving back feelings of power and control, or whether they rather increase aggressive feelings, with potentially harmful effects.",
        "Forty-six healthy participants watched 3 trauma movie segments depicting interpersonal violence. After each movie, one of 3 ImRS strategies (ImRS with violent revenge, ImRS without violence, safe place imagery) was applied. Dependent variables were subjective emotion ratings.",
        "Aggressive and positive emotions changed most strongly with the safe place image, no differences between ImRS with and without violence were observed. Sad and anxious emotions were not differently influenced by different strategies.",
        "Only a healthy sample with no previous display of aggression has been investigated. Cross-over effects cannot be excluded due to the within-group design with repeated trauma movie segments.",
        "Using violent pictures in ImRS does not seem to be particularly risky as it does not increase aggressive emotions in the participants; however it has no added value. For the purpose of emotion regulation after an analog trauma, the safe place imagery does best."
