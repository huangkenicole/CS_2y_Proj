        "This paper explores the ways empirically supported treatments (ESTs) help patients, therapists, and institutional administrators contain anxiety regarding complex human problems.",
        "The authors synthesized relevant literature with their experience as clinicians and psychotherapy researchers.",
        "ESTs may manage patient anxieties by framing their symptoms in clearly stated mechanisms and relying on a therapist who is an \"expert\" capable of healing them quickly. ESTs allow therapists to streamline treatment decisions and minimize intersubjective aspects of treatment which reduces the complexity of therapy. ESTs assist institutional administrators in the top-down dissemination of treatments and limit concerns about malpractice and insurance reimbursement by providing assurance that interventions have been vetted.",
        "While recognizing the benefits of ESTs, relying on ESTs to manage anxieties may diminish the importance of patient factors and clinical judgment, the other critical aspects of evidence-based practice, and thus limit the potential of clinical practice to reduce human distress."
