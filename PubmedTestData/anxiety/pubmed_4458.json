        "Hospitalization, regardless of disease, is known to provoke anxiety in the patient admitted for minor surgery. If unrecognized, prolonged anxiety creates stress which may subsequently harm the patient and delay recovery. If nursing intervention is to be therapeutic, it is argued that recognition of and response to this area of patient need should be based on current research findings within the framework of a nursing model. The relationships between pre-operative anxiety, types of coping strategy and information received are discussed with reference to current literature. Open-ended and flexible assessment formats based on Orem's therapeutic self-care requirements and King's open-systems framework are proposed."
