        "This study compared the anxiety scores of 30 clients and their spouses who had received home visits from the nurse with 30 clients and spouses who did not receive home visits. All clients had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Anxiety was measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form Y-1, and the Affect Adjective Check List, Today Form. Analysis of variance investigated differences between anxiety scores of clients and six demographic variables. Type A behavior pattern was assessed by the Jenkins Activity Survey and a tool based on the Framingham Type A Scale. A t-test showed that clients and families who received home visits had significantly lower anxiety levels than those who did not receive visits (P < 0.05). A t-test also showed that Type A clients and families had the same or even lower anxiety scores than Type B clients and families, but was not significant (P < 0.05). Results of the study indicate the value of home visits to the client with a coronary artery bypass graft and to the family by the nurse as a method of decreasing anxiety and preventing costly rehospitalization."
