        "Ambulatory assessments offer opportunities to study physical activity level (PAL) and affect at the group and person-level. We examined bidirectional associations between PAL and affect in a 3-h timeframe and evaluated whether associations differ between people with and without current or remitted depression/anxiety.",
        "Two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n\u2009=\u200993), remitted (n\u2009=\u2009176), or no (n\u2009=\u200990) Composite International Diagnostic Interview depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) were assessed by EMA 5 times per day. Average PAL between EMA assessments were calculated from actigraphy data.",
        "At the group-level, higher PAL was associated with subsequent higher PA (b\u2009=\u20090.109, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and lower NA (b\u2009=\u2009-0.043, p\u2009<\u2009.001), while higher PA (b\u2009=\u20090.066, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and lower NA (b\u2009=\u2009-0.053, p\u2009<\u2009.001) were associated with subsequent higher PAL. The association between higher PAL and subsequent lower NA was stronger for current depression/anxiety patients than controls (p\u2009=\u2009.01). At the person-level, analyses revealed heterogeneity in bidirectional associations.",
        "Higher PAL may improve affect, especially among depression/anxiety patients. As the relationships vary at the person-level, ambulatory assessments may help identify who would benefit from behavioral interventions."
