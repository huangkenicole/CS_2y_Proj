        "Preoperative anxiety is a challenging problem in the preoperative care of patients. Identifying risk factors helps nurses provide psychological support during the pre-operative visit so that stress can be reduced.",
        "This study aimed to determine the prevalence of surgical anxiety and related factors in hospitalized surgical patients.",
        "This research was designed as a point-prevalence study. The study was completed with 223 patients hospitalized in the surgical clinics of a tertiary hospital in Turkey. Surgical anxiety questionnaire (SAQ) and State-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were used for the assessment of anxiety.",
        "Preoperative anxiety prevalence was 69.5% according to the SAQ and 49.3% according to STAI. Women, participants with no primary school education, those who were unemployed and had low income, those with no previous surgery, those living in fear of surgery, the participants who underwent major surgery and general anesthesia, and those who did not have knowledge about the surgical procedure and anesthesia had higher anxiety according to the two scales. A highly significant and positive correlation was found between total STAI and total SAQ.",
        "The importance of surgical anxiety for the health system, which affects two out of every three hospitalized patients, should not be underestimated. Therefore, national and global plans should be made to prevent and manage surgical anxiety."
