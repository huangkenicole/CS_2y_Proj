        "There are mixed results from studies of COVID-19-related anxiety. We explored older people's perspectives on anxiety and support during lockdown.",
        "We thematically analysed 730 written comments from older community-dwelling adults aged 55-85\u00a0years in Aotearoa/New Zealand.",
        "Despite some anxiety during lockdown, for those who were retired, working at home or receiving wage subsidies, the experience was very enjoyable. Whether living alone or in households, anxieties were largely ameliorated by a sense of support from family, fellow citizens and government. In contrast, essential workers, those who lost employment and informal carers did not feel sufficient community support to alleviate their anxiety.",
        "Concerns about the plight of older people focus on stereotypes of isolated elders, ignoring the needs of workers and carers. The inductive approach taken to this study provided useful information about the success of supportive measures and highlighted the need to broaden the focus of concern."
