        "The aim: To identify the relationship between neurotic states and hardiness as an indicator of mental health, to explore the possibility of using the cognitive-behavior therapy techniques to correct neurotic states in young people.",
        "Materials and methods: The methods \"Clinical questionnaire for the detection and evaluation of neurotic conditions\" (K. Yakhin, D. Mendelevich) and \"Hardiness Survey\" (S. Muddi, adapted by D. Leontev, O. Rasskazova) were used for diagnosis. Wilcoxon test was used to determine changes in the manifestations of neurotic states in the conditions \"before\" and \"after\" the application of cognitive-behavior therapy techniques. Correlation analysis was used also to distinguish the relationship between neurotic states, hardiness and its components.",
        "Results: It has been identified that various neurotic states are differently related to hardiness as an indicator of mental and social health. The level of anxiety and obsessivephobic disorders has inverse negative relationship with general level of hardiness (r = -0.31 and r = -0.34), but the level of asthenia has a positive connection with this indicator (r = 0.49). The level of neurotic anxiety is inversely related with the level of personal involvement in life (r = -0.27). The effectiveness of CBT techniques (psycho-education, distancing, cognitive reassessment) for the correction of neurotic states, namely: anxiety (p <0.01) and hysterical reaction type (p <0.01) was proved.",
        "Conclusions: Neurotic states are correlated with level of hardiness (an indicator of mental and social health) and personal involvement in life. The correction of neurotic states can be effectively carried out by means of CBT."
