        "To evaluate the prevalence of the general and uroflowmetry (UF)-related anxiety in patients performing UF, and to assess whether anxiety may affect patient's micturition at UF.",
        "This prospective study recruited candidates to UF. Recorded data were: demographics, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and anxiety questionnaires (IPSS, ICIQ-FLUTS, GAD-7, APAIS-M), UF parameters, linker-type scale for UF satisfaction/reproducibility and discomfort.",
        "We enrolled 167 patients (non-na\u00efve 59.3%). One hundred twenty-five were men. General anxiety was found in 55.3% of patients (63.2% na\u00efve), and UF-related anxiety in 41.3% (46.5% non-na\u00efve). No significantly different rate of anxiety was found between na\u00efve and non-na\u00efve patients. A significant difference was found between IPSS total score in patients without anxiety (10.9 \u00b1 6.4) and subjects with anxiety (16.9 \u00b1 7.3; P < 0001). According to the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire, only the subscore F was significantly greater in women with a high level of general and UF-related anxiety (7.8 \u00b1 6.1 vs 12 \u00b1 4.9; P < .001). A low UF satisfaction/reproducibility was reported by 27.5% of patients, in 21.7% of subjects with general anxiety, and 36.6% of patients with UF-related anxiety. High discomfort was recorded in 58.1% of patients. Anxiety affected women twice more than men, and patients with high anxiety had worse urinary symptoms. Non-na\u00efve anxious patients had lower reproducibility of micturition and higher discomfort than na\u00efve anxious candidates to UF.",
        "Several patients showed high general and UF-related anxiety at UF, had worse subjective feelings about the reproducibility of their habitual micturition patterns. In anxious patients, knowledge of UF did not avoid a lower reproducibility of micturition, nor a more considerable discomfort."
