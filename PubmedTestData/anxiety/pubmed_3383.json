        "Although many children and youth with AS exhibit anxiety that may lead to challenging behaviors, stress and subsequent behaviors should be viewed as an integral part of the disorder [36]. As such, it is important to understand the cycle of behaviors to prevent seemingly minor events from escalating. Although understanding the cycle of tantrums, rage, and meltdowns is important, behavior changes will not occur unless the function of the behavior is understood and the student is provided instruction and support in using (1) strategies that increase social understanding and problem solving, (2) techniques that facilitate self-understanding, and (3) methods of self-calming. Because little research exists on the cycle of behaviors exhibited by students with AS and interventions appropriate at each stage, a systematic program of research is required to identify which techniques are most appropriate for children and youth, the context in which they can be used, and methods to ensure that individuals with AS generalize these skills to home, school, and community."
