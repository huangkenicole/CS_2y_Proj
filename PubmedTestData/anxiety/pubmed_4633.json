      "AbstractText": [
        "Further examination of the molecular regulators of long-term calorie restriction (CR), reported to have an anxiolytic effect, may highlight novel therapeutic targets for anxiety disorders. Here, adult male Hooded Wistar rats were exposed to a 25% CR whilst anxiety-like behaviour was assessed at 6-, 12-, and 18-months of age via the elevated plus maze, open field, and acoustic startle tests. Next-generation sequencing was then used to measure transcriptome-wide gene expression in the hypothalamus, amygdala, pituitary, and adrenal glands. Results showed an anxiolytic behavioural profile across early, middle, and late adulthood by CR, with the strongest effects noted at 6-months. Transcriptomic analysis by seven attribute weighting algorithms, including Info Gain Ratio, Rule, Chi Squared, Gini Index, Uncertainty, Relief, and Info Gain, led to the development of a signature of long-term CR, independent of region. Complement C1q A chain (<i>C1qa</i>), an extracellular protein, expression was significantly decreased by CR in most regions examined. Furthermore, text mining highlighted the positive involvement of <i>C1qa</i> in anxiety, depression, neurodegeneration, stress, and ageing, collectively identifying a suitable biomarker candidate for CR. Overall, the current study identified anxiety-related phenotypic changes and a novel transcriptome signature of long-term CR, indicating potential therapeutic targets for anxiety, depression, and neurodegeneration."
