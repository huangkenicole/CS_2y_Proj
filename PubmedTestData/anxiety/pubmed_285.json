        "The changes accompanying the transition to parenthood, joined by the fears aroused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to high levels of parental anxieties and stress, particularly among parents of young infants. This study, conducted in the midst of the crisis, explores the level of COVID-19-related anxieties and parenting stress of Israeli parents in their first year of parenthood.",
        "First-time mothers (n\u2009=\u2009469) and fathers (n\u2009=\u2009137), aged 21-50, completed self-report questionnaires in April, 2020. They were divided into two groups: parents of younger infants (aged 3-6\u2009months); parents of older infants (aged 7-12\u2009months).",
        "The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high, with the greatest concern aroused by public transportation and public places, followed by concerns over the possible infection of family members and the infant, going for infant check-ups, getting the virus themselves, and the health of the infant. In both groups, mothers reported higher COVID-19-related anxieties than fathers. Fathers of older infants reported higher parenting stress than mothers.",
        "The results highlight the need to be attentive to the double stress of new parents in the first year of parenthood in a time of crisis, and to the potentially greater vulnerability of fathers of older infants."
