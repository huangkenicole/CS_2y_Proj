        "We sought to identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) AND anxiety profiles and evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as levels of global stress, cancer-specific stress, cumulative life stress, and resilience.",
        "Patients (n\u202f=\u202f1332) completed the Attentional Function Index and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory six times over two cycles of chemotherapy. Global, cancer-specific, and cumulative life stress and resilience were evaluated using Perceived Stress Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Life Stressor Checklist-Revised, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, respectively. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct joint CRCI AND anxiety profiles. Differences were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric tests.",
        "Three classes were identified (ie, No CRCI and Low Anxiety [57.3%], Moderate CRCI and Moderate Anxiety [34.5%], and High CRCI and High Anxiety [8.2%]). All of the stress measures showed a dose-response effect (ie, as the CRCI AND anxiety profile worsened, scores for all three types of stress increased). The two highest symptom classes reported higher occurrence rates for six specific stressors (eg, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual harassment).",
        "Findings suggest that higher levels of co-occurring CRCI AND anxiety are associated with some common risk factors, as well as higher levels of stress and lower levels of resilience. Increased knowledge of modifiable risk factors and sources of stress associated with the co-occurrence of these two symptoms will assist clinicians to identify high-risk patients and implement individualized interventions."
