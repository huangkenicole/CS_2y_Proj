        "The present study investigated differences in anxiety symptoms and associated features between 129 first-time and multiple-time male inmates from a large urban jail. Participants were assessed on three separate anxiety measures: the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-III-R Disorders (SCID) anxiety disorders module, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and anxiety scales of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). First-time inmates were found to have more symptom severity for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, especially symptoms related to scanning and vigilance. Both first-time and multiple-time inmates evidenced higher state than trait anxiety, although this pattern did not hold for African Americans. Contrary to previous research, few ethnic differences were found in this incarcerated sample."
