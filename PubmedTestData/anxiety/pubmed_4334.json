        "Reminiscence therapy provides benefits among first-episode acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and their caregivers. This study intended to further compare the effect of reminiscence therapy plus usual care (RTUC) and usual care (UC) on cognitive function, anxiety, and depression among recurrent AIS patients.",
        "Totally, 160 recurrent AIS patients were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the RTUC group (N\u2009=\u200981) and UC group (N\u2009=\u200979), then a 12-month corresponding intervention was conducted in each group. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were evaluated on discharge (M0), at month (M) 3, M6, M9, and M12 after discharge.",
        "MMSE scores at M6 (27.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 vs. 26.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3, P\u2009=\u20090.031) and M12 (27.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vs. 26.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4, P\u2009=\u20090.009) were elevated, while cognitive impairment rate at M12 (29.2% vs. 45.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.042) and cognitive impairment severity at M12 (P\u2009=\u20090.029) were declined in RTUC group compared to UC group. Meanwhile, the HADS-anxiety scores at M9 (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 vs. 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0, P\u2009=\u20090.046) and M12 (5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7 vs. 7.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3, P\u2009=\u20090.024), anxiety rate at M12 (22.2% vs. 38.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.039) and anxiety severity at M12 (P\u2009=\u20090.018) were declined in RTUC group compared to UC group. Besides, the HADS-depression score at M12 (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 vs. 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3, P\u2009=\u20090.043) was decreased in RTUC group compared to UC group, but depression rate and severity were not different between the two groups at each visit point (all P\u2009>\u20090.05).",
