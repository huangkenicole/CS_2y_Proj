        "According to the American Cancer Society, more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2015. Anxiety levels in individuals diagnosed with cancer are high, with the highest levels occurring at the time of diagnosis. A cancer diagnosis and the associated chemotherapy are life-altering events for patients and their families. In addition to managing the devastating news about the disease, patients are tasked with learning to manage the impact of chemotherapy and its impact on their bodies and sense of well-being. These authors report the development of an education video aimed at addressing typical questions and concerns about treatment regimens. Results of their studies to determine the effectiveness of their video indicate significant value for the patient, especially anxiety reduction and enhanced ability to absorb new information and instructions from their caregiving team."
