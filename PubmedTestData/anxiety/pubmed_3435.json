        "Eating disorders (ED) and social anxiety disorder are highly comorbid with potentially shared symptoms like social appearance anxiety (SAA) referring to a fear of being negatively evaluated by others' because of overall appearance. SAA constitutes a risk factor for eating psychopathology and bridges between EDs and social anxiety disorder.",
        "The present studies examined internal consistency, factor structure, test-retest reliability, gender and age invariance, convergent validity and differences between individuals with and without an ED\u00a0of a German version of the social appearance anxiety scale (SAAS) in four independent samples (n<sub>1</sub>\u2009=\u2009473; n<sub>2</sub>\u2009=\u2009712; n<sub>3</sub>\u2009=\u200979; n<sub>4</sub>\u2009=\u200933) including adolescents and patients with EDs.",
        "Consistently, the SAAS showed excellent internal consistency (\u03c9s\u2009\u2265\u20090.947) and a one-factorial structure. Convergent validity was shown via high correlations of the SAAS with social anxiety (e.g., social interaction anxiety r\u2009=\u20090.642; fear of negative evaluation rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.694), body image disturbance measures (e.g., shape concerns rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.654; weight concerns rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.607; body avoidance rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.612; body checking rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.651) and self-esteem (r\u2009=\u2009-0.557) as well as moderate correlations with general eating psychopathology (e.g., restrained rs\u2009\u2265\u20090.372; emotional r\u2009=\u20090.439; external eating r\u2009=\u20090.149). Additionally, the SAAS showed gender and age invariance and test-retest reliability after 4\u00a0weeks with r\u2009=\u20090.905 in Study 2 and was able to discriminate between individuals with and without an ED in Study 4.",
        "Hence, the German version of the SAAS can reliably and validly assess SAA in female and male adolescents or adults with or without an ED. Additionally, the SAAS might be used in a therapeutic context to especially target patient groups suffering from EDs with comorbid social anxiety.",
