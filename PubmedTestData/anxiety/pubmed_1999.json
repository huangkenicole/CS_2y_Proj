        "Parents of children with cancer are prone to psychosocial distress, yet little is known about intervention response among diverse parents. Our systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on anxiety and depression among parents of children with cancer and explored race and/or ethnicity differences in the efficacy of these interventions. Twenty articles met inclusion. The aggregate effect size on anxiety (-0.01, 95% CI: -0.95, 0.93, p\u00a0=\u00a0.97) and depression (-0.56, 95% CI: -1.65, 0.54, p\u00a0=\u00a0.32) showed micro to medium effects, with larger negative effect sizes indicating that anxiety and depression scores after treatment were lower for parents in intervention group as compared to control group. Neither aggregate effect size was statistically significantly different from zero. Due to underrepresentation of minorities, we could not perform subgroup or moderator analyses. Several efficacious psychosocial interventions were found to reduce parental anxiety. Future studies to examine psychosocial interventions in minority parents are warranted."
