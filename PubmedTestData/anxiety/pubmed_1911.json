        "Anxiety has been associated with childhood abuse/neglect, but this relationship and its mechanisms are poorly documented in older adults. This study examined the association between childhood abuse/neglect and late-life anxiety temporal patterns (i.e. absence, remission, incidence, persistence), testing for mediators.",
        "Data were derived for 724 French-speaking community-living older adults participating in the <i>\u00c9tude sur la sant\u00e9 des ain\u00e9</i>s - <i>Services</i> study with available information at baseline and 4-year follow-up. Past-month anxiety was based on a cutoff score \u22655 on a French translation of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder at interviews. Questions on childhood abuse/neglect (e.g. psycho-emotional, physical, sexual) were administered. Adjusted multinomial regression analyses and mediation bootstrapping models were used. Tested mediators included traumatic events (excluding childhood abuse/neglect), daily hassles, psychological resilience, and cortisol activity.",
        "The absence, remission, incidence and persistence of anxiety was found in 45.3%, 25.3%, 8.7% and 20.7% of the sample, respectively. Participants with incident and persistent late-life anxiety experienced more childhood abuse/neglect. Participants with persistent anxiety also reported lower psychological resilience. The association between childhood abuse/neglect with anxiety incidence was mediated by daily hassles, while its association with anxiety persistence was mediated by daily hassles and psychological resilience.",
        "Past childhood abuse/neglect was associated with late-life anxiety incidence and persistence, with psychological resilience and daily hassles potentially explaining this relationship. Further research should focus on ascertaining the clinical applications of psychosocial and biological profiles in informing the prevention and personalized treatment of anxiety in older adults."
