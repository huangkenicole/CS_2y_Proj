      "AbstractText": [
        "This study aimed to explore the changes in unmet care needs, perceived social support, and levels of distress experienced by newly diagnosed Greek patients with gynecological cancer during the phase after diagnosis and before surgical treatment (T0), and 4 months after surgical treatment at the first postoperative follow-up visit (T1).",
        "This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study based on the framework of stress and coping theory. The Needs Evaluation Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and a demographic and clinical data questionnaire were distributed to a convenience sample of 86 patients.",
        "A convenience sample of 86 patients newly diagnoised with gynecological cancer participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 60.7 years (SD\u00a0=\u00a010.9 years) while 57.6% of them were married. Overall, patients' needs and social support had significantly decreased at T1 compared to T0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, respectively). DASS-21 subscale scores did not change significantly at T1, whereas anxiety levels were significantly lower at follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). Changes in anxiety levels were associated with changes in needs related to family (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), need for assistance/care (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) and support (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and total needs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).",
        "The phase following cancer diagnosis and awaiting surgery is a high-risk period for the mental health of women with gynecological cancer, and one that requires special attention from healthcare professionals. By identifying unmet needs, addressing anxiety and providing appropriate social support, healthcare professional can contribute significantly to improving patients' quality of life throughout their cancer journey."
