      "AbstractText": [
        "In cancer patients, stress is associated with a psychoneurologic (PN) symptom cluster of depressed mood, anxiety, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. The stress of caregiving may trigger similar symptoms among caregivers and warrants investigation. The purpose of this analysis was to characterize correlates of PN symptom burden in cancer caregivers.",
        "Cancer patient-caregiver dyads (n\u2009=\u200929) provided eight weekly symptom reports using a web-based survey. Primary and secondary stressors of caregiving were also assessed. Mixed models accounting for repeated measurement were used to assess the between- and within-dyad predictors of caregiver PN symptom burden. The interaction of patient PN symptom burden and stress was tested. Exploratory cross-lagged Actor-Partner Interdependence Models were used to assess the week-to-week interdependence between patient and caregiver symptoms.",
        "Caregivers most frequently reported feeling anxious (44% on average across timepoints), sleep problems (31%), fatigue (25%), and depressed mood (24%). Mixed models indicated that within dyads, greater hours of care and more patient symptoms were associated with greater caregiver PN symptom burden. Greater baseline perceived stress was also associated with higher caregiver PN symptom burden and moderated the association between patient and caregiver PN symptom burden. Cross-lagged Actor-Partner Interdependence Models indicated longitudinal interdependence among survivor and caregiver symptom burden.",
        "The findings provide preliminary evidence of the interrelationship of PN symptom burden in caregivers and patients and the potential for stress to amplify this interrelationship, with implications for symptom management and supportive care practice."
