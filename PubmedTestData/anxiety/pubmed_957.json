        "Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are heterogeneous conditions characterized by marked variations in mood. High levels of anxiety are often present in these conditions and are associated with increased suicidal risk, increased disease duration, and treatment resistance. Mood stabilizers or antipsychotics are recommended for the treatment of bipolar disorder in comorbidity with anxiety disorders. This study examines current knowledge to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of anxiety in mood disorders.",
        "A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, selecting randomized control trials that evaluated the efficacy of quetiapine on anxiety symptoms in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder and included anxiety evaluation scales.",
        "We collected 27 studies (19 with primary data analysis, 8 with secondary data analysis) regarding the use of quetiapine in mood disorders. Quetiapine was more effective than placebo and active comparators in reducing anxiety in unipolar and bipolar patients in 20 of these studies. In 7 studies, quetiapine was not superior to psychoactive comparators or placebo on the anxiety dimension.",
        "Statistical power might be limited by small sample size in 5 of the studies included in our review. Moreover, data on anxiety were a secondary outcome in most studies. Nevertheless, the reported studies show with good levels of concordance that quetiapine is effective in controlling anxiety symptoms in patients with mood disorders. This evidence supports current guidelines and recommendations concerning the use of quetiapine in clinical practice."
