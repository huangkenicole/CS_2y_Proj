        "Marine fishermen experience high levels of environmental and relationship stress and anxiety. The current study explored the role of stress in the relationship between neuroticism and anxiety symptoms among marine fishermen.",
        "Participants (fishermen from Tanmen in Qionghai city, Hainan Province) completed three questionnaires: the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory-Neuroticism Subscale (NEO-FFI-N); the Mental Stressor Investigation Questionnaire (MSIQ); and the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire-30-item-Anxious Arousal Subscale (MASQ-D30-AA) within 1 week before embarking on a fishing trip and then again within 1 week after their return to port. The data were subjected to correlational analyses and structural equation modelling.",
        "Positive correlations were found between NEO-FF-N (neuroticism) score, MSIQ score (total stress), MSIQ work-relationship score, ship environmental stress score, and MASQ score (anxiety symptoms). Regression analyses showed environmental stress had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between neuroticism and anxiety symptoms, and further analysis showed a mediating effect of work-relationship stress on the relationship between neuroticism and anxiety symptoms.",
        "Marine fishermen with high environmental stress had greater anxiety symptoms than those with low environmental stress. Neuroticism in marine fishermen further affects anxiety symptoms by affecting the level of work-relationship stress."
