        "The major purpose of this paper is to explore some tentative hypotheses concerning the relationship between the athlete's personal (internal) vulnerability and the realistically induced stress of world class competition. Clinically-oriented psychodynamic theory provides the theoretical underpinnings for this exploration. First, the positive, and particularly the negative impart of anxiety and depression on athletic performance is discussed. Then, for purposes of demonstrating the potential applications of clinically-oriented theory, a composite case example is offered illustrating the manner in which an athlete's internal vulnerability could lead to performance inhibitions. Finally, some tentative formulations are offered with a view towards correctively intervening with athletes whose natural capacity to cope with stress is temporarily outstripped, leading to inhibited performance."
