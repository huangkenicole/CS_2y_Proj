        "The COVID-19 pandemic had a notable impact on the psychological well-being of a large part of the population, putting them at risk of developing depressive symptoms, different levels of anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One group considered to be at high risk are Nursing students; they were affected as learning strategies changed and clinical practices were cancelled. This study attempts to assess the psychological impact COVID-19 pandemic had on Nursing students and to explore the sociodemographic differences that can be risk factors for mental health disturbance. The psychological impact was evaluated using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The study took place 4 months after the state of alarm was declared over in Spain. From a total sample of 304 Nursing students, 26.7%, 39.8%, and 15.5% showed PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms, respectively. Severe levels of psychological impact have been associated with being a female, a smoker, and feeling fear and stress. Having a relative test positive has been linked to lower anxiety levels while being afraid or stressed to higher anxiety levels. Being a female, co-habit with friends and feeling stress have been associated with higher depression levels."
