        "The purposes of this study were to determine (a) the relationship between preoperative uncertainty and anxiety of orthopaedic surgical patients in three adult developmental stages (young, middle, older) and (b) the differences in uncertainty and anxiety among the adult developmental stages, gender, and acuity levels of the disorder.",
        "Correlational and comparative with descriptive survey.",
        "106 adult orthopaedic surgical patients.",
        "Subjects were contacted 1 to 2 weeks preoperatively during their preadmission visit or upon early admission the day of surgery.",
        "All patients responded similarly in terms of having moderate levels of preoperative uncertainty and anxiety. There were no statistically significant differences among developmental stages, gender, or acuity levels for these orthopaedic patients.",
        "Nurses need to be aware that adult orthopaedic patients such as these subjects may have moderate levels of uncertainty and anxiety prior to surgery. In addition to physical preparation for surgery, nurses need to help patients with their emotional concerns. The incorporation of preoperative psychoeducational interventions and improved communication into plans of care for all orthopaedic surgical patients is recommended."
