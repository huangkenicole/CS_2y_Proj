      "AbstractText": [
        "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a severe condition, often co-occurring with depression and anxiety, that strongly affects the quality of life (QoL) in some patients. Conversely, depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with a 2-3 fold increase in mortality risk and were shown to act independently of typical risk factors in CHF progression. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of depression, anxiety, and QoL on the occurrence of rehospitalization within one year after discharge in CHF patients.",
        "148 CHF patients were enrolled in a 10-center, prospective, observational study. All patients completed two questionnaires, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Questionnaire Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) at discharge timepoint.",
        "It was found that demographic and clinical characteristics are not associated with rehospitalization. Still, the levels of depression correlated with gender (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.027) and marital status (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), while the anxiety values \u200b\u200bwere dependent on the occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, levels of depression (HADS-Depression) and anxiety (HADS-Anxiety) did not correlate with the risk of rehospitalization. Univariate logistic regression analysis results showed that rehospitalized patients had significantly lower levels of Bodily pain (BP, p\u2009=\u20090.014), Vitality (VT, p\u2009=\u20090.005), Social Functioning (SF, p\u2009=\u20090.007), and General Health (GH, p\u2009=\u20090.002). In the multivariate model, poor GH (OR 0.966, p\u2009=\u20090.005) remained a significant risk factor for rehospitalization, and poor General Health is singled out as the most reliable prognostic parameter for rehospitalization (AUC\u2009=\u20090.665, P\u2009=\u20090.002).",
        "Taken together, our results suggest that QoL assessment complements clinical prognostic markers to identify CHF patients at high risk for adverse events.",
