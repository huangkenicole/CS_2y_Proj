        "A descriptive, longitudinal study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a 2-day workshop designed to reduce the anxiety levels of new graduates participating in the NCLEX-RN examination. A hospital nurse administrator, in collaboration with nurse educators, provided a multimodal in-service program. \"Test wiseness,\" or test-taking strategies, and exercises related to physical and emotional well-being, were included for three groups of new graduates. Using Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale to collect data, reduction in anxiety after the workshop and at the completion of the NCLEX-RN experience was identified. All participants in the program passed the NCLEX-RN examination."
