        "Although neglected in diagnostic criteria lists, theoretical models, and treatment approaches, attenuated positive emotions and cognitions distinguish social anxiety and social anxiety disorder from other anxiety conditions (and cannot be accounted for by comorbidity with depression). We present a self-control resource depletion model to explain how the intense self-regulatory efforts of high socially anxious individuals dampen positive experiences and events. We review existing research on individuals with social anxiety difficulties, focusing on impoverished positive experiences and quality of life, atypical reactions to overtly positive social outcomes, the absence of a normative bias toward the positive in social situations, and a meaningful subset of individuals who show signs of impulsive, short-lived positive events. We also discuss findings from the social psychology literature for how to enhance positive experiences, positive events, and self-regulatory capacity in individuals with social anxiety difficulties. The aim of the review is to broaden theory, research, and treatment efforts to the positive spectrum of human functioning."
