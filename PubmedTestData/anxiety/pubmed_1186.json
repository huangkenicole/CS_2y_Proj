        "Despite the promise of transdiagnostic dimensional models of psychopathology, there have been few efforts to understand how distinct models can be combined to better capture the full range of psychopathology. The current report combines two prominent models of aspects of internalizing psychopathology, including a four-factor model of internalizing symptoms and a three-factor model of repetitive negative thought, to determine the degree to which these models are capturing distinct or isomorphic constructs. Employing model comparison techniques, we found that these models integrate into a single model which includes a general factor capturing covariance across internalizing dimensions (i.e., common internalizing), as well as specific factors for low positive affect, anxious arousal, anxious apprehension, and rumination. There was little evidence of a general repetitive negative thought factor over and above common internalizing, suggesting the two constructs are largely isomorphic. Importantly, all factors in the best-fitting model showed associations with diagnostic status across three psychiatric disorders, indicating external validity and potential clinical utility.
