        "This paper explores the subject of postoperative pain, touching on the theories of the physiological mechanisms by which pain is perceived and exploring in some detail the literature on those factors which affect the pain experience. The need for a detailed assessment of the pain which an individual experiences is suggested by this study of the literature. This concept is explored in some detail. The author explores the relationship between pain and anxiety, commenting on that which affects patients undergoing surgery. The relationship between anxiety and perceived helplessness or powerlessness is also discussed. The paper concludes by drawing together the information from the literature reviewed and the author suggests a hypothesis that pain, anxiety and perceived powerlessness have an effect on each other. There is a suggestion that decreasing perception of powerlessness may decrease the intensity of the pain experience for the individual. It is suggested that this is an area for future research into postoperative pain management."
