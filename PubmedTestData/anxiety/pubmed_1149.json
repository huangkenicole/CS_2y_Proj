        "Fearful patients are in emergency situation often inattentive, unable to concentrate, agitated or even aroused. They show reduced perception and restricted willingness to cooperate. In severe conditions these patients are strongly tending towards more hazardous behavior: refusal of necessary therapy, break out or even high suicidal risk. Within disaster situations (mass accidents, fires) fearful patients with their agitated and persuasive behavior can influence other victims and with that trigger a situation of mass panic that has to be avoided at any cost. Therefore these patients must be swiftly identified and separated from the event. A diligent diagnosis process including physical-neurological examination is necessary. The recommended treatment within the emergency situation consists of a close continuous personal contact through assuring and encouraging conversations. A sense of security should be created by explaining the planned therapeutic interventions in simple, easy-to-follow and understandable words. If this necessary psycho-therapeutic intervention can not be applied a short term psychopharmacological treatment is required preferably with Benzodiazepines. Still a longterm specific therapy is highly advised, since these disturbances, if left untreated, will lead to a chronic manifestation and with that to considerable psychosocial impairments."
