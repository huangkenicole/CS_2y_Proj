        "This article reviews new developments in rating scales for anxiety/anxiety disorders. Several new rating instruments have been developed. These instruments could be useful in various areas, such as research of anxiety disorders or in assessment of anxiety in patients with various somatic diseases (dyspnea, pain, chronic illnesses such as diabetes or cancer). Some of the existing instruments have been modified, shortened, or translated into other languages. Finally, psychometric properties of various rating scales for anxiety/anxiety disorders continue to be examined in various conditions and populations. In spite of all the development, there is no established standard in the area of measuring anxiety. However, a number of rating scales have become validated for measurement of severity of anxiety disorders."
