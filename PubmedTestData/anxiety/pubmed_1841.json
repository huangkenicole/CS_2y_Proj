        "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is generally considered to be one of the most successful orthopedic surgical procedures. However, no research has been conducted on the postoperative mental health of patients who underwent different approaches of THA. This paper seeks to compare the differences among three THA approaches: the normal lateral approach (NLA), the direct anterior approach (DAA) and the orthop\u00e4dische chirurgie m\u00fcnchen (OCM) regarding their influence on patients' postoperative anxiety and depression.",
        "A total of 95 THA patients were recruited for this study. All patients' preoperative information including results of Harris, SF-36 and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was carefully evaluated. Surgery-related data as well as five-day postoperative data were also collected. Three months after the surgery, a telephone follow-up was conducted to further evaluate patients' HADS and SF-36 results.",
        "In the three-month postoperative evaluation of anxiety and depression, the NLA group scored significantly higher than both the DAA group and the OCM group, which was found relevant to the patient's incision length and five-day postoperative VAS results. A correlation between anxiety scores and the days of postoperative hospitalization was also noticed. Further analysis of patients' psychological state based on the SF-36 results revealed considerable differences in viability (VT) and social function (SF) between the NLA group and the OCM group. Other surgery-related data and postoperative data all demonstrated better results of the DAA group and the OCM group compared to the NLA group.",
        "Among the three different surgical approaches of THA, DAA and OCM compared with NLA are found to ease patients' postoperative anxiety and depression.",
