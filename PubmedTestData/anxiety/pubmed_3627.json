        "Anxiety symptoms in children with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) often appear to be not as severe as those in children with anxiety disorders or often appear to be the core features of PDD, and therefore, they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. In this study, we assessed anxiety broadly in line with dimensions of anxiety and not with an operational categorical diagnosis. The objective of this study was to reveal that children with high-functioning PDD have more anxiety than children in the general population.",
        "Forty-six children with high-functioning PDD (6-15 years old) were assessed for total anxiety and six subcategories of anxiety, including separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, physical injury fears, and obsessive-compulsiveness. Anxiety in children with high-functioning PDD was compared to that in children of the general population and to that in children with anxiety disorders in a previous study.",
        "Children with high-functioning PDD had significantly more symptoms of total anxiety and all subcategories of anxiety except for social phobias than children in the general population, and had significantly fewer symptoms of total anxiety, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and social phobias than children with anxiety disorders.",
        "As anxiety in children with high-functioning PDD does not always meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder, psychiatrists must pay much attention to anxiety and not only depend on diagnostic criteria in order to not miss the chance of treating these children."
