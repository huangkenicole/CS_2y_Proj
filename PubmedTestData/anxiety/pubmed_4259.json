        "/Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy in depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with Parkinson's Tehran city.",
        "This quasi-experimental study was conducted with experimental and control groups at pretest, posttest, and follow-up. Patients 60-75 years old with Parkinson's disease centers and psychiatric services made up the study population. Based on a random sample of 90 people in Tehran city who scored highly on both the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Scale, in two 45-person groups-the experimental group and the control group-were randomly assigned. The experimental group underwent group cognitive behavioral therapy for 8 weeks, while the control group just received training once per week. Methods of analysis of variance with repeated measures were employed to test the hypotheses.",
        "The outcomes showed the independent variable is successful in lowering symptoms of anxiety and depression. Patients with Parkinson's disease who participated in group cognitive behavioral therapy for stress reduction showed a reduction in their anxiety and depressive symptoms.",
        "Effective psychological interventions, like group cognitive behavioral therapy, can improve mood, lessen anxiety and depression, and help patients adhere more closely to treatment guidelines. As a result, these patients can help prevent the complications of Parkinson's disease and take effective action to raise their level of physical and mental health."
