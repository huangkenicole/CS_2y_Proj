        "To assess the typical drinking situations of high anxiety sensitive individuals, relative to low anxiety sensitive individuals, a large sample of university student drinkers (N = 396) completed the 42-item version of the Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS-42) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). As hypothesized, ASI scores were significantly positively correlated with drinking frequency on the higher order IDS-42 factor of negatively reinforcing drinking situations and not significantly correlated with drinking frequency on the higher order factor of positively reinforcing drinking situations. Also, ASI scores were significantly positively correlated with drinking frequency on the lower order drinking situations factors of Conflict with Others, Unpleasant Emotions, and Physical Discomfort. ASI scores were also unexpectedly significantly correlated with more frequent drinking on the higher order factor of temptation drinking situations and with more frequent drinking on the lower order drinking situations factor of Testing Personal Control. These results have important implications for designing early prevention and intervention programs for high anxiety sensitive university student drinkers by helping them to develop alternatives to drinking in those situations (e.g., negatively reinforcing drinking situations) which place them at greatest risk for alcohol misuse."
