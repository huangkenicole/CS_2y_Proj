        "Attention bias modification (ABM) was developed to alleviate anxious symptoms by way of a reduction in anxiety-linked attentional bias to threat. Central to the rational of ABM is a learning-related reconfiguration of attentional biases. Yet, the neuroplastic changes in brain structure that underlie this learning are unresolved. The amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex are part of a system linked to attentional bias to threat and its modification with ABM. We assessed the extent to which ABM modulates gray matter volume and resting-state functional connectivity. Sixty-one individuals selected for attentional bias to threat and heightened trait anxiety completed a 6-week multi-session ABM protocol with 7200 total training trials. Participants were assigned to either an ABM (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or a control (n\u00a0=\u00a031) condition. We found that participants' levels of attentional bias and anxiety did not differ following ABM and control training interventions. However, the ABM group displayed greater levels of anterior cingulate cortex gray matter volume as well as greater superior frontal gyrus resting-state functional connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Changes in anterior cingulate cortex gray matter volume were linked to reduced anxious symptoms in the ABM, but not control, group. These findings suggest that ABM distinctively impacts structural and functional neural mechanisms associated with emotion reactivity and cognitive control processes."
