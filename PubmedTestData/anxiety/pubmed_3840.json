        "The Oral Behaviours Checklist (OBC) is a valid 21-item instrument quantifying the self-reported frequency of oral behaviours. An Italian version (OBC-It) has been released recently. Anxiety and oral behaviours are known to be associated in individuals with oro-facial pain due to temporomandibular disorders (TMD). However, information about this relationship in pain-free individuals is still limited.",
        "The aim of this study was to test the reliability of the OBC-It and its reduced version (OBC-It 6), focusing on tooth clenching-related wake-time oral behaviours, and the effect of patient instructions on reliability. A second aim was to test the association between trait anxiety and oral behaviours in pain-free individuals.",
        "Two hundred and eighty-two TMD-free students, divided into 2 groups (Group A, n\u00a0=\u00a0139, mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a022.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0years; Group B, n\u00a0=\u00a0143, 23.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0years), filled in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the OBC-It. Group B received instructions about the OBC-It, while Group A did not. After 2\u00a0weeks, both groups filled in the OBC-It again. However, Group B was further divided into 2 subgroups, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> . The first received the same instructions again, while B<sub>2</sub> did not.",
        "The test-retest reliability of the OBC-It (A: ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.87; B<sub>1</sub> : ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.94; B<sub>2</sub> : ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.95) and OBC-It 6 (A: ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.85; B<sub>1</sub> : ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.89; B<sub>2</sub> : ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.93) was excellent in all groups. Trait anxiety was weakly associated with OBC-It only in women (R<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a0.043, P\u00a0=\u00a0.021).",
        "The OBC-It is a reliable tool but further subjects' instructions might be needed. Trait anxiety has a limited effect on oral behaviours in TMD-free subjects."
