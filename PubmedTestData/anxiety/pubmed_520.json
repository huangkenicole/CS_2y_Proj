        "Demoralization has been extensively studied in oncology and palliative care settings, and is characterized by a loss of meaning and purpose in life, a sense of powerlessness over life events, and a sense of helplessness. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize the prevalence, associated factors, and adverse outcomes of demoralization in cancer patients by reviewing the literature of the last decade. Seven databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases) were systematically searched from January 2012 to June 2022. Roughly speaking, the prevalence of demoralization in cancer patients ranges from 13.50% to 49.4%. A total of 45 factors are associated with demoralization, of which psychological factors have been studied more frequently in the last decade. There are nine outcomes related to demoralization, with the strongest evidence for the correlation between demoralization and suicidal ideation. The study emphasizes the complexity of factors associated with demoralization in cancer patients. There appears to be a intersection between the constructs of demoralization and depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, which may explain the correlation between them."
