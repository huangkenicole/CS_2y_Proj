        "The use of graphic novels is a trending topic in health communication as a new form of visual storytelling which explores narratives of health care, cancer, healing, and disability. The objective of the present study was to evaluate - for the first time in the literature - the effect of graphic novels in reducing the anxiety of patients waiting for an incisional biopsy in an oral oncology setting.",
        "This open-label randomized clinical trial comprised 50 patients with a clinical suspicion of oral potentially malignant disorders. Twenty-five patients were randomly allocated to the test group, and a colourful graphic novel was provided. Subsequently, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 were administered to all 50 recruited patients, after which a biopsy was performed on each patient.",
        "No statistically significant difference was observed between the test and control groups for the variables regarding the demographic data (p>0.2). There was a significant difference after the introduction of the graphic novel, regardless of which questionnaire was used. The graphic novel demonstrated an improvement in the ability of the test group to tolerate anxiety while waiting for an oral biopsy in both psychological tests (p<0.05).",
        "In light of these initial positive results, the authors of this study would like to suggest the use of graphic novels in oral oncology, dentistry, and medicine with the aim of reducing patient anxiety."
