      "AbstractText": [
        "Pre-operative anxiety in children has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes such as difficulty in anaesthesia induction, emergence delirium and negative postoperative behavioural changes. Therefore, pre-operative anxiety should be alleviated in both children and clinicians.",
        "We investigated the effect on pre-operative anxiety of premedication with midazolam, playing video games or watching a cartoon about anaesthesia.",
        "A prospective randomised trial.",
        "Single-centre study performed between August 2018 and June 2019.",
        "We enrolled 138 patients aged 5 to 8 years undergoing elective surgery.",
        "After evaluating baseline (T0) anxiety levels using the modified Yale Pre-operative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) in the pre-operative holding area, 0.5\u200amg\u200akg-1 oral midazolam was given to Group M, a tablet with videogame applications was given to Group T, and Group S watched the cartoon '\u015e\u00fcko Is Being Operated'. mYPAS values were recorded a further three times: 20\u200amin after the intervention (T1), while entering the operating room (T2), and during mask induction of anaesthesia (T3).",
        "The primary endpoint was the change in children's anxiety levels from baseline. The secondary endpoint was cooperation during mask induction.",
        "The baseline mYPAS scores were comparable (40.7, 42.6 and 40.7 in groups M, S and T respectively). The mean mYPAS scores at T1 were 32.6, 34.7, 26.8 and at T2 were 38.6, 42.7, 35 in groups M, S and T, respectively. There were significant differences between groups S and T at T1 and T2 (P\u200a<\u200a0.001, P\u200a=\u200a0.010). A significant decrease was found in Group T compared with both groups M and S from T0 to T1 (P\u200a=\u200a0.002). mYPAS values at T3 were 38.3, 43.7, 39.5 in groups M, S and T, respectively, with no difference between the groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.224). Mask acceptance scores were similar in all groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.912).",
        "The passive teaching technique of watching a video for reducing anxiety levels was not effective. However, active distraction with videogames was found to be a valuable method to reduce pre-operative anxiety.",
