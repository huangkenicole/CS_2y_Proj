        "Previous research has suggested that the effectiveness of different types of preparatory information in reducing presurgical anxiety will depend on the locus of control orientation of the patient. This study examined this interaction and the relationship of presurgical anxiety to patient background variables. Subjects in this study were 60 female patients awaiting gallbladder surgery. Patients' state anxiety was assessed before and after the presentation of one of three types of information: reassurance, self-care instructions or a neutral message. Anxiety was measured with the Affect Adjective Check List (AACL), and locus of control orientation was measured with Rotter's I-E scale. The expected interaction of information type and locus of control orientation was not found, but anxiety differed significantly depending on the patient's age and whether or not the patient had had visitors. Patients' anxiety scores also declined significantly from initial to second AACL administration. Contact with visitors, including patients' contact with the investigator, appeared to be effective in reducing patients' anxiety. However, alternative interpretations for the significant findings are presented."
