        "This study investigated the positive rate and related influencing factors of anxiety screening in pregnant women during the first fetal magnetic resonance examination.",
        "A total of 303 pregnant women who met the criteria for magnetic resonance pregnancy examination in a Grade III maternity hospital from December 2021 to December 2022 were included by the convenience sampling method. A cross-sectional survey was conducted before the examination using the General Situation Questionnaire and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS).",
        "The positive rate of anxiety was 31.02% (94/303), and the average score of anxiety was 45.71\u00b19.84. Univariate analysis results showed that age, educational level, occupation, place of residence, per capita monthly income, and number of pregnancies were related to the anxiety status of pregnant women in the fetal magnetic resonance examination (P<0.05). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that the factor of college degree [OR: 2.168, 95% CI: (1.119, 4.273)] in the classification of cultural level and country factor [OR: 2.162, 95% CI: (1.066, 4.385)] in the classification of place of residence had an impact on the anxiety score of pregnant women in the fetal magnetic resonance examination (P<0.05).",
        "The positive rate of anxiety screening of pregnant women before the first prenatal magnetic resonance examination is high. A low education level and living in the countryside will increase the probability of anxiety in pregnant women during magnetic resonance examination. Based on the above research results, it is suggested that medical institutions pay attention to the mental health of pregnant women, improve mental health care services, and reduce the adverse psychological problems caused by prenatal examination."
