        "The authors identify possible psychological mistreatment and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of women who were attended to in the \"Sant Josep\" Primary Health Care Center in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat in Barcelona Province between February and June 2005 by means of an observational, descriptive and transversal study with a consecutive study of women older than 18 who were attended to by nurses for whatever health problem they had or who filed administrative paperwork. Data was obtained through the use of a self-administering questionnaire on which these items were recorded: social-health variables, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and questions elaborated ad hoc in order to identify mistreatment. More than half of the study participants complied with the criteria used to indicate symptoms of anxiety and depression, which recommended a follow-up session. The authors observed an association between depression and mistreatment. Part of the results of this study were presented in The 1st World Congress on Gender-Specific Medicine in February 2006 in Berlin. Financial Sources: The School of Nursing at the University of Barcelona (PREU12004/10) and the Catalan Institute for Women (U-39/05)."
