        "Despite the use of perioperative anxiolytics and pain medication, surgery can be a stressful and painful experience. Providing patients with distractions using video and/or audio tools in addition to medication may be helpful. To date, no studies have compared different distraction modalities in a same-day surgical setting in adults. This study aims to determine whether audio-visual distraction with video glasses (AVD) is more effective in reducing anxiety and pain compared to audio distraction (AD) in conscious patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. It was hypothesised that AVD, being the more immersive modality, would be more effective than AD on the outcome parameters.",
        "Fifty patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery with local and/or regional anaesthesia in a clinical day-care setting were randomly assigned to receive either fixed-scenery AVD or patient-choice AD with music. Primary outcome was anxiety, as measured by the Dutch version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 (STAI-6) prior to and 15\u00a0min after the intervention. Secondary outcomes were pain (Numeric Rating Scale Pain [NRS-P]), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and patient satisfaction.",
        "Within each group, there was a significant reduction in anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.028 for AVD, p\u2009<\u20090.001 for AD). In contrast to our hypothesis, listening to music without watching a video (AD group) reduced anxiety significantly more than experiencing full AVD (p\u2009=\u20090.018). The mean pain score did not change significantly within either user group, nor did pain scores differ between user groups.",
        "In conscious patients undergoing surgery, watching a movie (using video glasses and a headphone set) and listening to music (using only a headphone set) are able to significantly reduce anxiety. AVD, although believed to provide higher levels of distraction, did not prove to be superior to AD. The clinical relevance of this study highlights the potential benefits of AVD or AD modalities in improving the surgical experience for conscious patients. Further research is required to examine the influence of freedom of choice in content on the aforementioned outcomes. To estimate the true value of higher immersion levels, different distraction modalities (e.g. AVD versus virtual reality) featuring the exact same scenery or content need to be compared.",
