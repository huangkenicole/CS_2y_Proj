        "This study compared anxiety in two groups of women undergoing elective cesarean delivery to ascertain if their partner's presence during neuraxial anesthesia placement affected patients' overall anxiety levels.",
        "Three hundred fifteen patient-partner dyads were randomized to two groups: group 1 partners were present in the operating room during neuraxial anesthesia placement while group 2 partners remained outside the operating room during placement. Before surgery, all patient-partner dyads completed a survey of demographics, anesthetic experiences and baseline anxiety. Anxiety levels were rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the state portion of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.",
        "The mean change in anxiety as measured by VAS among patients whose partners were present in the operating room for neuraxial anesthetic placement decreased from before to after the procedure (-4.5+/-25.8; P=0.03; 95% CI -8.55, -0.45); the mean change in anxiety in patients whose partners were not present did not alter significantly (+1.9 +/- 25.3; P=0.34; 95% CI 6.68, 12.12). Anxiety was increased among partners who were not present (+9.4, P<0.001).",
        "Although patients whose partners were present in the operating room at the time of neuraxial anesthesia placement reported less anxiety over the time of the study than did patients whose partners were not present, these differences were small and are not considered to be clinically important. Increased anxiety among partners who were not present at neuraxial placements warrants further study."
