        "Irritability represents a transdiagnostic symptom in youths, which can become a predictor of long-term psychosocial adversity. Yet, few tools investigate this symptom in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CL-ARI in an Italian population, analyzing the correlations between irritability and other pathological constructs.",
        "A cross-sectional study was carried out in a Child Neuropsychiatry Unit in Rome. A transdiagnostic sample of 67 youths aged 7-17\u2009years, which underwent to a psychodiagnostic evaluation, was administered by a clinician with the translated version of the CL-ARI, along with tools exploring irritability and other constructs (depressive symptoms, anxiety, global impairment in functioning).",
        "The most frequent diagnosis obtained by the psychodiagnostic evaluation was anxiety disorder, followed by disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and no diagnosis. Cronbach's alpha values revealed good internal consistency for the total score (0.86), as well as for the score of each subscale of the tool (0.81 for temper outbursts, 0.89 for irritable mood, 0.71 for impairment). Test-retest reliability showed excellent values (ICC 0.89 to 0.98), and criterion validity exhibited good correlation among the sub-scales and between each sub-scale and the total score. Finally, positive correlations were found between total scores of the parent and the child interview, and between the CL-ARI, the measure of DMDD severity (CGI) and of depressive symptoms (CDI 2).",
        "These data confirmed that the CL-ARI is a promising tool designed to intercept irritability, with good psychometric properties. Further research on the assessment of irritability is critical and thus encouraged."
