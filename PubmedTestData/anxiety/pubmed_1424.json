        "Anxiety is common in hospitalized patients and can worsen pain or lead to unsuccessful pain relief.",
        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of measuring anxiety with a visual analog scale (VAS) in the hospitalized patient experiencing pain.",
        "We conducted a multiple-center cross-sectional study.",
        "Adult inpatients experiencing moderate to severe pain defined by a pain VAS score \u226540 of 100 were included.",
        "Pain and anxiety data were collected using the following instruments: pain VAS, anxiety VAS, State Anxiety Scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-YA) and Anxiety Subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD-A).",
        "Data were collected from 394 patients. Of those patients, 43.6% (171 of 392) and 36.6% (143 of 391) had significant anxiety according to STAI-Ya and HAD-A, respectively. Correlation was good between anxiety-VAS and STAI-YA (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.67 [95% confidence interval 0.61-0.72]) and moderate between anxiety VAS and HAD-D (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.48 [0.39-0.56]). The main factor predictive of situational anxiety was history of anxiety-depression symptoms (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.95 [1.93-4.56]). For anxiety VAS score \u2265 40 of 100, the sensitivity for detecting anxiety was 81% with 70% specificity.",
        "This study confirmed the high prevalence of anxiety among inpatients experiencing pain, demonstrated the capacity of a VAS to assess this anxiety, determined an anxiety VAS cutoff level to screen for significant anxiety, and identified risk factors of anxiety in this population. Anxiety VAS has been found to be an easy-to-use method familiar to caregivers, with all the advantages needed for an effective screening instrument. An anxiety VAS score \u226540 of 100 would thus warrant particular attention to adapt care to the patient's anxiety-related pain and initiate specific therapeutic interventions."
