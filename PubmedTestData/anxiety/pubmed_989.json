        "To compare nursing assessments of moods, behaviors, and activity levels of patients receiving bone marrow transplants (BMTs) according to type of isolation environment.",

        "University BMT unit.",
        "Records of 22 patients receiving BMT treated over a two-year period-12 were treated in laminar air flow (LAF) rooms and 10 in reverse isolation.",
        "Using a retrospective chart review, daily nursing assessments of patients' moods, behaviors, and activity levels were collected and compared based on type of isolation.",
        "Type of isolation and patient's behavior, mood, and activity level.",
        "Patients assigned to LAF had significantly higher anxiety levels at admission than those assigned to reverse isolation.",
        "Admission to LAF isolation appeared to be more anxiety-provoking than admission to reverse isolation; however, this finding needs to be replicated in a study with a prospective design using standardized psychosocial assessment. Findings are consistent with the evidence that patients view isolation as a temporary inconvenience rather than a major stressor.",
        "Future research is needed. Preparing patients for isolation can include tours, educational materials, and explanations of procedures and events. Physical contact, even through gloves, can impart warmth and caring in the isolation environment."
