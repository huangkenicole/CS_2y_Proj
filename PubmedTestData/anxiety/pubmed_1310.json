        "Aberrant threat processing is a known cognitive characteristic of anxiety disorders and irritability. Youth with more severe symptomatology show greater allocation of attention towards threat relative to neutral stimuli. Although irritability contributes to poorer outcomes among anxious youths, irritability has not been considered as a contributing factor to threat processing in anxiety disorders. Thus, the current study examined the role of irritability in predicting attention biases for threat among clinically anxious youth. Our study included 84 clinically anxious youth (M\u2009=\u20099.31\u00a0years old, SD\u2009=\u20092.44) who completed a dot-probe task to determine attention biases. Anxiety disorders were assessed using semi-structured diagnostic interviews. Well validated measures were used to assess the severity of anxiety and irritability symptoms via child- and parent-report, respectively. Findings indicated that more severe irritability predicted greater attention biases toward threat among clinically anxious youth, covarying for age, anxiety severity, and the number of comorbid diagnoses. At a trend-level, anxiety severity also predicted attention bias for threat. Among clinically anxious youth, irritability severity was the strongest predictor of attention bias toward threat. Findings point to the salience of irritability, and to some extent anxiety severity, in relation to threat processing among youth with clinical anxiety disorders."
