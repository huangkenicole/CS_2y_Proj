        "Anxiety symptoms present immediately following parental death and approximately 8 weeks following the death were evaluated in 38 prepubertal children. Comparison groups included 38 hospitalized depressed children and 19 normal children. Bereaved children and parents were administered the Grief Interview and all were administered standard diagnostic interviews (DICA-C/P). While no bereaved children met DSM-III-R criteria for any anxiety disorder, anxiety regarding other family members dying was reported in 55% of bereaved children immediately after death and in 63% approximately 8 weeks later. When DSM-III-R anxiety symptoms were assessed, bereaved children did not report significantly more anxiety symptoms in the approximate 8-week interval post-parental death than normal comparison children, and had significantly fewer anxiety symptoms than depressed children (p < 0.0001). Bereaved children who had the most anxiety symptoms were also likely to have a depressive disorder (p < 0.002). Age and sex of child, sex of surviving parent, anticipation of death, and family history of anxiety or depressive disorders were not significantly associated with increased anxiety."
