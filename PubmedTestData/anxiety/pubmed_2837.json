      "AbstractText": [
        "Various models have been used to explain somatization, including attachment theory, which describes how formative experiences influence perceptions of vulnerability and threat. Although attachment insecurity is associated with greater physical symptoms, the mechanisms by which attachment insecurity influences the experience of physical symptoms are not clear. Sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) describes a low threshold to responding to stimuli and high emotional reactivity. It is associated with both attachment insecurity and physical symptoms. The purpose of this study is to test a model in which attachment insecurity, depression, and SPS interact to influence physical symptoms.",
        "Cross-sectional data from the online Self-Assessment Kiosk were used (N\u00a0=\u00a0186). Participants were surveyed regarding attachment insecurity (ECR-M16), physical symptom severity (PHQ-15), sensory processing sensitivity (HSPS), and depression (PHQ-9). A path analysis was used to analyze the data.",
        "Modal participants were white (74%) single (45%) women (80%) with university education (79%). Attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and sensitivity were correlated with physical symptom severity. The data suggested that sensitivity mediates between attachment anxiety and physical symptoms (\u03b2<sub>indirect</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.070, p\u00a0=\u00a0.003 and \u03b2<sub>direct</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0-0.030, p> .05) and this relationship remains significant when controlling for depression.",
        "This study extends our understanding of the potential pathways that lead individuals with attachment insecurity to experience burdensome physical symptoms by supporting a mediating role for SPS."
