        "Perinatal anxiety is among the most common mental health conditions that have a huge negative impact both on mothers and their children. This study aimed to establish summary estimates of the prevalence of perinatal anxiety and its influencing factors in Mainland China.",
        "A systematic search was carried out from nine major English and Chinese electronic databases to identify studies published up to August 20, 2022 with data on the prevalence of perinatal anxiety. Two reviewers conducted data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed when possible.",
        "271 studies representing 369,477 women were included in the study. Pooled prevalence of perinatal anxiety was 17.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 16.2\u00a0% to 18.7\u00a0%), with prenatal anxiety 17.4\u00a0% (95%CI: 16.1\u00a0% to 18.8\u00a0%) and postpartum anxiety 17.5\u00a0% (95%CI: 13.5\u00a0% to 22.4\u00a0%). However, the overall estimates presented substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a098.93\u00a0%). Qualitative summaries demonstrated some main potential risk factors of perinatal anxiety such as women with abnormal pregnancy-labor history, poor health status, pregnancy complications, and unplanned pregnancies, and some potential protective factors such as high family income, good social support, good interpersonal relationships, and history of multiple deliveries.",
        "Very large heterogeneity among studies was observed in meta-synthesis, and all included studies used self-report scales to identify anxiety rather than diagnostic interviews.",
        "Varying degrees of perinatal anxiety is prevalent among Chinese women. Screening and evidence-based interventions are urgent and necessary to address this public concern and promote their health and well-being."
