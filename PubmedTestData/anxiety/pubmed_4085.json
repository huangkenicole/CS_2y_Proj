        "The visual expression of adolescent and preadolescent people including their representation of aggression is a neglected field of both the child psychology's and pedagogy's research. The author offers a survey of pubescent people's portrayal of aggression based upon the data of the scientific literature and her own pedagogical experience. The representation of aggression is strongly influenced by the young people's cultural background and the media (history, literature, religion, the traditions of the different nations, and gender too) concerning both form and content. Aggression can appear directly or in a hidden, symbolic way. Pictorial expression aggression is closely bound up with depressed feelings, congestion and humour and can also refer to the fact that the drawing person was sexually, physically or psychologically abused. The survey is completed with a case study that shows the connection between the aggressive content and the anxiety. The case study also calls our attention to the weakness of the pedagogical practice in making use of the self-expressive aspect of visual communication."
