        "In this article the most important etiologic factors related to dental anxiety are presented and form the basis for the exposition of a model for the psychologic development of dental anxiety. The model shows that personality factors related to emotion and cognition can influence the development of dental anxiety. In order for the anxiety to develop and become manifest it is also necessary that: 1: the individual experiences a given stimulus as presenting a physical threat, e.g. in the form of pain, 2: the individual has been exposed to an experience or a learning situation involving the stimulus, and finally, 3: the individual in connection with this stimulus, experiences somatic reactions such as sweating, abdominal discomfort or tachycardia. This triad interacts in such a way that the individual elements can reinforce each other and thus increase the anxiety, (full-drawn arrow) or also the opposite, (stipled arrow). In this way pain control (anesthesia/sedation), positive reinforcement/information or bodily control (relaxation/biofeedback) will contribute to attenuate or prevent the development and manifestation of anxiety. The model further demonstrates that odontophobia also develops and is contingent upon the opinions, attitudes, feelings and behavior with regard to dental health, hygiene and dentists which is present in the social relationships in the family, the group, social class and the culture. This complex social psychologic process is called socialization, and it expresses the individuals more or less conscious adaptation to society. An important part of this process is imitation or social learning, which forms an important aspect of human development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
