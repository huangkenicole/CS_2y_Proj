        "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among dental students and its association with factors such as gender, year of study, phase of the course, and ethnicity.",
        "A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students in a medical institute in Malaysia. Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was assessed by Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21).",
        "A total of 351 students took part in the study with a mean age of 22.38 (+1.69) years. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress with varying severity among the study population was 60.4, 75.2, and 50.4%, respectively. The prevalence of symptoms of depression among the study population appears to be independent of gender, ethnicity, and academic year of study. Our results show that stress and anxiety may be influenced by gender with more prevalence in females.",
        "Early detection of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress is of great importance to take timely remedial action to keep the mental well-being of individuals. Maintaining the mental health of young medical professionals is a need of society in the present world. Further studies are suggested to recognize other factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among dental students.",
        "Considering the students who experience depression, anxiety, or stress during undergraduate schooling, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure effective learning. Students who have shown higher scores shall be advised for further follow-up and treatment strategies or appropriate counseling programs."
