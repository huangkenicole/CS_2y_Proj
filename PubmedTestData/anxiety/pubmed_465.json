        "The work is based on the conviction that anxiety and its control is a primary problem of man on Earth. Adults who are emotionally attached to a child feel the necessity to protect him. There exists also a syndrome of excessive anxiety and so-called untreatable children. The anxious child can easily succumb to panic: inducing moments are e.g. all medical practices which restrict free mobility or enforce an unusual position of the body. Anxiety is a permanent and to a considerable extent genetically conditioned character trait. Psychologists include it among so-called hard personality traits. The author mentions auxiliary provisions to help anxious children: 1. assurance, 2. training how to use economically his own forces and 3. building a system of safety measures. The author gives an account of principles for dealing with parents of anxious children."
