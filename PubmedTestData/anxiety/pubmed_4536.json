        "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is associated with higher rates of clinically significant anxiety and depression than in healthy populations. Psychosocial interventions targeting anxiety and depression in IBD have variable efficacy and disparate treatment approaches, making treatment recommendations difficult. The current study aimed to identify effective treatment components across psychosocial treatment approaches for anxiety and depression in IBD.",
        "A systematic review of psychosocial treatments for anxiety and depression in IBD was conducted. Based on the Distillation and Matching Model, treatments were coded and data aggregated by intervention components, or practice elements (PE), to elucidate replicable clinical techniques.",
        "The percentage of studies utilizing a given PE was the primary outcome.",
        "Among all included studies, as well as among those finding favorable, significant effects on anxiety or depression, the percentage utilizing each PE and number of PEs utilized was determined.",
        "The most utilized PEs among included interventions were relaxation, IBD psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, distraction, and social skills. Examining only interventions with favorable differences on specified outcomes (HRQoL, Anxiety, Depression, and/or Coping) indicated that relaxation, education, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness were most utilized.",
        "Implications for clinical practice are discussed, including the development and dissemination of treatment recommendations."
