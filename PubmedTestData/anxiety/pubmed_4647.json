        "The aim of this study was to determine the reported frequency and self-perceived importance of factors related to health care seeking by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and the effect of reassurance on these factors.",
        "Fifty-five IBS patients, consulting for the first time, answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate these factors (FRQ), measurements of anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). A thorough explanation of the disease and reassurance were given, and the FRQ was answered again.",
        "The frequency of factors was: pain/discomfort, 78%; cancer fear, 11%; daily function impairment, 33%; symptoms stressfulness, 60%; and none, 2%. Pain/discomfort and symptom stressfulness were considered the most important ones. Cancer fear and symptom stressfulness correlated with anxiety (P=.003, .042), depression (P=.038, .019), and daily function impairment with depression (P=.05). Cancer fear, daily function impairment, and symptom stressfulness impacted on QoL. Reassurance acutely decreased the self-perception of daily function impairment (P=.003), independent of the patient's educational level.",
        "Reassurance during the first consultation for IBS decreased the self-perception of impairment in daily function."
