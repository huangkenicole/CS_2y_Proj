        "The small percentage of children with anxiety problems who receive psychological treatment, and the negative psychological consequences associated with these problems highlight the need for early detection. Although assessment instruments with appropriate measurement properties exist, they tend to be extensive, making it difficult to apply them in clinical settings, schools, or primary care practices. This study aimed to adapt the Spanish brief version for parents of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS-P-8). For this purpose, information on 215 children between 8 and 12\u00a0years of age was reported by 163 parents. The Spanish version of the SCAS-P-8 adequately fit a one-factor structure, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 44.25; <i>df</i> = 19; comparative fit index = .97; Tucker-Lewis index = .96; root mean square error of approximation: .07 (.04, .09); standardized root mean squared residual = .08. Evidence of internal consistency of the total SCAS-P-8 score was good (<i>\u03b1</i> = 0.82), and the direct correlations obtained between the SCAS-P-8 and internalizing problems showed evidence of convergent validity. Moreover, the appropriate measurement properties of the SCAS-P-8 were shown to be independent of gender. Differences in sociodemographic variables and SDQ-P between children with anxiety symptoms and those without anxiety symptoms were also discussed. Information reported by parents can help the clinician carry out an accurate diagnosis. A brief assessment scale can be easily applied in schools or primary care settings."
