        "Anxiety sensitivity, defined as the fear of anxiety and arousal-related sensations, has been among the most influential cognitive-based transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factors in the study and treatment of emotional and related disorders. The currently available anxiety sensitivity measures are limited by their length. Specifically, the length of these instruments discourages the adoption of routine anxiety sensitivity assessment in clinical or medical settings (e.g., primary care). The goals of this study were to develop and assess the validity and reliability of a short version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007), entitled the Short Scale Anxiety Sensitivity Index (SSASI), using three independent clinical samples. Results indicated that the abbreviated five-item version of the SSASI had good internal consistency and a robust association with the ASI-3. Further, across the samples, there was evidence of unidimensionality and excellent convergent and discriminant validity. There also was evidence of partial measurement invariance across sex and full measurement invariance across time. Overall, the five-item scale offers a single score that can be employed to measure anxiety sensitivity. Use of the SSASI may facilitate screening efforts and symptom tracking for anxiety sensitivity, particularly within clinical settings where practical demands necessitate the use of brief assessment instruments."
