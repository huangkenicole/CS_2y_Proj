        "To investigate the positive impact of e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy on the sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of nurses on site during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Nurses on site at the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital\u00a0Airport Site experiencing insomnia, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 prevention and control period, from February 2020 to April 2021, were selected and divided into either an e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy (eCBT-I) group or a control group using a randomized grouping method. The eCBT-I group was given standard eCBT-I for 6 weeks; the control group did not get any intervention. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to evaluate the sleep quality of the subjects. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to assess the subjects' anxiety and depression. Changes in sleep quality, anxiety and depression before and after treatment were compared\u00a0between the two groups.",
        "Of 118 nurses randomized, the PSQI and ISI scores within the eCBT-I group (n=60) were significantly lower after treatment (5.9 \u00b1 3.9, 6.7 \u00b1 4.5) than before treatment (10.4 \u00b1 3.5, 12.4 \u00b1 4.7) (p <0.05). Compared to the scores of the control group (n=58) (9.1 \u00b1 3.9, 10.6 \u00b1 4.1), the PSQI and ISI scores in the eCBT-I group (5.9 \u00b1 3.9, 6.7 \u00b1 4.5) were lower after treatment (p <0.05). The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores in the eCBT-I group were all lower after treatment (3.7\u00b13.4, 4.2\u00b14.1) than before treatment (6.7\u00b14.9, 7.7\u00b15.1) (p <0.05). Compared with subjects in the control group (7.1\u00b15.6, 7.3\u00b15.1), subjects in the eCBT-I group (3.7\u00b13.4, 4.2\u00b14.1) had lower scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales after treatment (p <0.05).",
