        "Surgical trainees experience intrinsic stress and anxiety during high-acuity clinical situations which can negatively impact performance. Emerging data suggests that education in mindfulness-based coping techniques may improve performance. We evaluated the effects of a stress recovery intervention on novice trainees' perceived level of anxiety during an intentionally stressful simulation.",
        "Participants were recruited from surgical intern classes over three consecutive years. All participants completed a simulation intentionally designed to evoke a stress response. Participants then completed a stress recovery intervention or received no additional training. All participants then completed a second novel simulation.",
        "Intervention participants had significantly higher self-reported ability to manage stress (intervention 2.4 to 3.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; control 2.8 to 3.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06), and stop, think, and observe (intervention 2.5 to 3.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; control 2.6 to 3.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) during the second simulation. Both groups also had significantly lower levels of state anxiety during the second simulation as compared to the first (intervention 45.1 vs 59.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; control 49.3 vs 57.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). During the second simulation, trainees in both groups reported improvements in perceived abilities to: recognize stress (intervention 2.7 to 4.1, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; control 2.9 to 3.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), communicate with and lead their team (intervention 2.4 to 3.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; control 2.3 to 3.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and to prioritize, plan, and prepare (intervention 2.1 to 3.1, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; control 2.1 to 3.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).",
        "Our research shows that a brief intervention was associated with a significant increase in trainee ability to both recognize internal stress and engage in proactive coping mechanisms. This research also shows that while repeated stress-inducing simulations may themselves decrease perceived anxiety levels in novice surgical trainees, training in coping strategies may potentiate this effect."
