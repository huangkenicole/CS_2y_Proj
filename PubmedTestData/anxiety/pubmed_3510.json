        "Both self-regulation and insistence on sameness (IS) are related to anxiety, which is a common feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we aimed to characterise the IS-self-regulation-anxiety interrelationship by investigating the potential contribution made by self-regulation, assessed via effortful control (EC), to the IS-anxiety relationship in a sample of adolescents and young adults with ASD.",
        "Seventy-one older adolescents and younger adults with ASD (49 males, 22 females; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>\u00a0=\u00a018.71\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.51, range 14.42-24.81) completed the Adult Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire-2, Effortful Control Scale of the Adult Temperament Questionnaire and the DSM-5 Dimensional Anxiety Scales.",
        "IS was associated with both EC (<i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a0-.39, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and anxiety (<i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a0.45, <i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and anxiety was in turn associated with EC (<i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a0-.44, <i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a0.001). To characterise the nature of this interrelationship, two mediation analyses were performed using the serial mediation model in PROCESS with 5000 resamples in bootstrapping. There was a significant indirect effect of EC on anxiety, through IS (<i>b</i>\u00a0=\u00a0-.06; BCa 95% CI [-.13, -.02]), and indirect effect on anxiety through EC (<i>b</i>\u00a0=\u00a01.62; BCa 95% CI [.59, 3.24]) with the mediators accounting for 29.07 and 26.04% of the total effect, respectively.",
        "Our study provides the first exploration of the IS-anxiety-self-regulation link in ASD. The finding that lower levels of self-regulation are related both to anxiety and IS behaviours points to self-regulation as a viable intervention target for both anxiety and IS behaviours."
