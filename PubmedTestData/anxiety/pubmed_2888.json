        "Exposure therapy is a central component of the first-line treatment for anxiety disorders, a common mental health condition that is twice as prevalent in women relative to men. A key underlying mechanism of exposure therapy is fear extinction, which is an active learning process supported by a neural circuitry that is highly regulated by ovarian hormones. This review synthesises research examining the impact of hormonal contraceptives on laboratory fear extinction tasks in female rats and women, and on exposure therapy in women with anxiety disorders. The evidence indicates that hormonal contraceptives have a detrimental impact on fear extinction and exposure therapy that is consistent across species, and from laboratory to clinical settings. Candidate pathways by which hormonal contraceptives impede fear extinction and exposure therapy include suppression of endogenous ovarian hormones and glucocorticoids, and downregulation of signalling pathways that support extinction learning. Key areas of focus for future research are discussed."
