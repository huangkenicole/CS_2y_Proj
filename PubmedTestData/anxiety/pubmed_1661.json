        "One of the most downloaded articles in 2017 from the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, and Physics was a study suggesting that music therapy during radiation therapy (RT) simulation substantially reduces anxiety. To further evaluate the potential of music's clinical efficacy in the context of radiation therapy, we conducted a randomized trial evaluating the influence of genre-based music chosen by the study participant on anxiety during the first RT treatment session with a method that is applicable to routine clinical practice.",
        "We conducted a prospective randomized trial of music versus no music during the first RT treatment for cancer. We limited the study to women because prior studies document a higher rate of anxiety in female patients with cancer. Anxiety was evaluated before and after the first RT treatment using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Symptom Distress Thermometer (SDT). Patients randomized to music had their preferred genre of music played from a web-based application while in the treatment vault.",
        "In the study, 102 females were enrolled (51 with and 51 without music). Baseline high anxiety score before RT was recorded in 48% of patients using the STAI and 58% using the SDT. The percent decrease in mean STAI score was 16% with music versus 10% without music (P = .2197). The mean SDT percent changes were a 13% decrease with music versus a 2% increase without music (P = .3298).",
        "This study documents that high anxiety is common in women receiving RT for cancer and that music, as used in this study, does not reduce anxiety to a meaningful degree."
