        "To systematically evaluate the risk factors of depression and anxiety in older adults with cancer.",
        "This PRISMA-adherent systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42022372747) involved a systematic database search for prospective and retrospective cohort studies.",
        "We included 33 cohort studies with 31 evaluating depression and seven evaluating anxiety. Systematic synthesis yielded various protective and exacerbating factors for depression and anxiety amongst older adults with cancer. These factors span a range of domains: (1) Cancer and associated treatment-related factors; (2) Medical, physical and functional factors; (3) Demographic factors and; (4) Social and lifestyle factors. At the individual-level, the most significant factors were the presence of chronic medical comorbidities, having pre-existing psychological symptoms, and poor baseline physical and functional status. Within the social unit, the degree of social support and presence of a partner were most significant.",
        "The deleterious impact comorbid psychological symptoms can have on older adults with cancer can be profound. In this review, we highlight a range of protective and exacerbating factors identified from cohort studies that may enable policymakers to tailor and individualise interventions to manage depression, anxiety and associated burden in this vulnerable population. The relative paucity of studies evaluating anxiety highlights an important research gap."
