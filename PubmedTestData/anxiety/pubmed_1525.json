        "The aim of this cross-sectional study to assess the proportions of anxiety and depression in patients with CuTS, and to explore the associated demographic and clinical features.",
        "From May 2011 to January 2017, 246 patients diagnosed with CuTS were recruited. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess the proportions of depression and anxiety. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression were carried out to identify the variables that were independently associated with anxiety and depression.",
        "The proportions of depression and anxiety were 17.9% (n\u00a0=\u200944) and 14.2% (n\u00a0=\u200935), respectively. Five patients had both possible/probable anxiety and depression. Logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus was independently associated with depression; and the modified McGowan grade was independently associated with anxiety.",
        "In patients with CuTS, the proportions of depression and anxiety were 17.9% and 14.2%, respectively. Early screening for anxiety and depression is beneficial for patients with CuTS."
