      "AbstractText": [
        "Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disorder, which can be associated with psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. This study investigated the efficacy and the mechanism of action of a natural compound coptisine using imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mice. Coptisine reduced the severity of psoriasis-like skin lesions, decreased epidermal hyperplasia and the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-22. Furthermore, coptisine improved IMQ-induced anxiety in mice by increasing the number of entries and time in open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Coptisine also lowered the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the prefrontal cortex of psoriasis mice. HaCaT keratinocytes and BV2 microglial cells were used to investigate the effects of coptisine in vitro. In M5-treated HaCaT cells, coptisine decreased the production of IL-6, MIP-3\u03b1/CCL20, IP-10/CXCL10, and ICAM-1 and suppressed the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, coptisine reduced the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. These findings suggest that coptisine might be a potential candidate for psoriasis treatment by improving both disease severity and psychological comorbidities."
