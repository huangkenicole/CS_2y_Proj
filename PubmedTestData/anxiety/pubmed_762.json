        "With improved survivorship in liver transplantation (LT), there is an emerging focus on functional recovery and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after surgery. The present study aimed to assess HRQoL after LT using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).",
        "This was a prospective analysis of LT recipients between 2020 and 2021. A total of 238 patients were contacted by phone at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the PROMIS 29-Profile. Scores were recorded and computed using the HealthMeasures Scoring Service.",
        "PROMIS was available for 174 patients at 3 (n = 58), 6 (n = 57), and 12 months (n = 59). Overall, mean PROMIS scores were 47.6 \u00b1 3, 47.6 \u00b1 3, and 47.6 \u00b1 3 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Most domains improved postoperatively by 12 months except for anxiety and sleep disturbance measures. The lowest domain in the immediate postoperative period was physical functioning, but this had the closest return to normative population values. Pain interference was above the population reference during the initial postoperative period, improving by 12 months where they were below mean population values. Depression and fatigue scores improved by 6 months and appeared to stabilize by 12 months post-LT. Patients demonstrated increased social participation, and scores were remarkably higher than general population means at each timepoint.",
        "LT can impact physical, mental, and social health which, in this setting, remains largely unexplored using PROMIS instruments. We report that although overall patient well being can improve, some mental health domains require further consideration during the postoperative period."
