        "With first research reports dating back to the 1970s, the important role of anxiety in the perioperative period has been recognized for a long time and remains in effect.",
        "The global pooled prevalence of preoperative anxiety among 14\u200a000 surgical patients was reported to be 48%. The underlying fears among surgical patients include: fear of surgical complications, worry about the duration and degree of disability after the procedure, concerns about general anesthesia and the associated loss of control, as well as fear of waking up and experiencing discomfort and pain during or after surgery. The type and invasiveness of the planned procedure contribute to differences in preoperative anxiety levels. While preoperative anxiety is higher in younger, female patients as well as in those with a high need for information, prior exposure to anesthesia or surgery was associated with lower anxiety levels. High levels of preoperative anxiety may lead to poor postoperative pain control and increased morbidity. Due to adverse effects such as delirium, the use of benzodiazepines to manage preoperative anxiety has decreased.",
        "Preoperative anxiety remains a critical issue in the perioperative period. Further research is needed to develop effective management strategies, which may need to be tailored to the patient's individual need."
