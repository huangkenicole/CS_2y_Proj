        "To examine age differences in the expression of childhood fears and anxiety symptoms.",
        "A cross-sectional design was used to test recently formulated developmental hypotheses regarding the differential expression of childhood anxiety symptoms and fears in a community sample of youths (N = 145). Three groups of youths were compared: children aged 6-9 years (n = 47), preteens aged 10-13 years (n = 52), and adolescents aged 14-17 years (n = 46). Symptoms of separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety were assessed using a dimensional approach by both parent and child report. Fears were assessed by child report.",
        "The results indicated that there are systematic age differences in the expression of childhood fears and anxiety symptoms. Results also point toward specific symptoms predominant at certain ages (i.e., separation anxiety symptoms in youths aged 6-9 years, death and danger fears in youths aged 10-13 years, and social anxiety symptoms as well as failure and criticism fears in youths aged 14-17 years) in partial support of predictions.",
        "Models of the etiology of childhood anxiety disorders tracing continuity and change over time should consider differences in the developmental expression of childhood fears and anxiety symptoms. Attention to developmental issues concerning symptom expression may be important in the clinical understanding of childhood anxiety."
