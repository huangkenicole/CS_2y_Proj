        "Free associations (coupling) of 139 Hungarian primary school children about their teeth was collected. Dental fear (DAS, DFS) and general anxiety scores were measured. Typical dental events (i.e.: loss of deciduous teeth, simple and traumatising dental treatments, tooth fractures) were coupled by the participants in 41.0% of the cases. Functions and importance of the teeth and oral hygiene were described in 20.1% of the cases. Simple, grotesque, or magical stories and tales about teeth were found in 8.6% of the cases. No answer was given in 30.2% of the cases. Highest dental fear and general anxiety scores were found in the group coupled traumatising dental treatment. Traumatising loss of deciduous teeth was caused by the dentist or by the father of the child, and was associated with higher dental fear and general anxiety comparing to simple loss of deciduous teeth. Higher dental fear and general anxiety scores were found in the group coupled functions and importance of the teeth comparing to the group coupled simple, grotesque, or magical stories and tales, or the group giving no answer."
