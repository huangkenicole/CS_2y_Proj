        "Recent evidence suggests intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic variable elevated across anxiety disorders. No studies have investigated IU's response to transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety (TGCBT). This study evaluated IU outcomes following TGCBT across anxiety disorders.",
        "151 treatment-seekers with primary diagnoses of social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or GAD were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of TGCBT and completed self-report questionnaires at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment.",
        "IU decreased significantly following treatment. Decreases in IU predicted improvements in clinical presentation across diagnoses. IU interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation irrespective of primary diagnosis. IU also interacted with time to predict improvement in clinical presentation although interactions of time with diagnosis-specific measures did not. IUS interacted with time to predict reduction in anxiety and fear symptoms, and inhibitory IU interacted with time to predicted reductions in anxiety symptoms but prospective IU did not.",
        "IU appears to be an important transdiagnostic variable in CBT implicated in both initial presentation and treatment change. Further implications are discussed."
