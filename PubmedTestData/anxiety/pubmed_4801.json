        "27 gifted students in junior high and high school from north central Kansas school districts were administered the Children's Depression Inventory, the Beck Depression Scale, Test Anxiety Scale, General Anxiety Scale, and Breskin's Rigidity Scale. Sex, age, and grade were not considered, as the sample was small. The gifted students' mean scores for depression were below the cut-off score while their test anxiety, general anxiety, and rigidity scores were at moderate levels. Pearson correlations were significant for Beck Depression with the Children's Depression (r = .82) and General Anxiety Scales (r = .60). Scores on the General Anxiety Scale correlated significantly with those on the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .69) and the Test Anxiety Scale (r = .55). Rigidity scores were not correlated significantly with any other measure and scores on the depression scales did not correlate significantly with those on the Test Anxiety Scale."
