        "To summarize recent findings regarding anxiety and trauma-related disorders in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (autism), focusing on the distinct ways in which these conditions may be expressed, as well as advances in evidence-based assessment and treatment.",
        "Current findings suggest both anxiety and trauma-related disorders may be more prevalent, yet more complicated to address in autistic relative to non-autistic children. Overlapping symptoms and distinct manifestations of these disorders pose challenges for the accurate identification, assessment, and treatment of anxiety and trauma-related disorders in autistic children. Emerging evidence recommends adapting traditional assessment and treatment approaches to better meet the needs of autistic children. Recent research suggests autism-centered conceptualizations, which accommodate complexity in how anxiety and trauma-related disorders are experienced and expressed by autistic people, are needed to enhance the psychiatric care of this population."
