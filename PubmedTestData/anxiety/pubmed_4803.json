        "Some studies did find significant differences in the level of depression of women while undergoing diagnostic evaluation of an abnormal Papanicolaou screening smear, but findings were not consistent. This study aimed to assess prevalence and correlates of depression in women with abnormal cervical screening results before and after diagnostic procedures.",
        "A cross-sectional study was carried out during 2017 in a cohort of women with positive Papanicolaou screening test before and after diagnostic procedures (colposcopy/biopsy/endocervical curettage) at the university Clinical Centre Kragujevac, Serbia. Women completed a questionnaire about demographics, lifestyle, and other factors of interest. Also, questionnaire \"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\" (HADS) was used immediately before and 2-4\u00a0weeks after the diagnostic procedures: a score of \u22658 on HADS-D and HADS-A subscales indicated depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was applied in the data analysis.",
        "The study comprised 172 women, giving a response rate of 72.3%. The mean age of the participants was 47.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1\u00a0years (range 23-65). The frequency of depressive symptoms was significantly higher after diagnostic procedures (48.3%) than before diagnostic procedures (37.2%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038). Before diagnostic procedures, older age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.60; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09-2.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), and level of anxiety according to the HADS-A subscale (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.61; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.38-1.88; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significant independent predictors of depression. After diagnostic procedures, significant independent predictors of depression were urban place of residence (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.12; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.03-0.47; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and level of anxiety according to the HADS-A subscale (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.85; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.54-2.21; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",
        "Our study showed that older age, rural residence, and anxiety play a role in shaping the risk of depression among women undergoing additional diagnostic procedures after receiving an abnormal Papanicolaou screening result."
