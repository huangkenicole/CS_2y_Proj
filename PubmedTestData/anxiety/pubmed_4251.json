        "Since we face considerable practical problems in the assessment of elderly subjects with self-rating instruments (paper-pencil tests) measuring anxiety and, since we lack norms for the age of 65 and above, we developed a structured inventory (SAIS) for the assessment of anxiety in the elderly. The instrument comprises three components, anxiety normally is expressed in; all have been verified by empirical personality research: the cognitive, the physiological and the behavioural component. In a pilot study, we determined themes of anxiety relevant to elderly people. When the items were developed, we took into account aspects of the typical environment of the elderly and their comprehensive ability. In a reliability study 54 subjects (mean age: 72 years) were investigated. Item analyses showed low to average item difficulties and average selectivity. The split-half-reliability coefficient was rtt = .95; the internal consistency-coefficient was rtt = .91 (Kuder-Richardson). In a factor analysis five factors were extracted. They were interpreted as 'general' anxiety (\"allgemeine Angstlichkeit\"), as nervousness (\"Neigung zu Nervosit\u00e4t\"), fear of physical disability (\"Furcht vor motorischer Behinderung\"), personal insecurity (\"pers\u00f6nliche Unsicherheit\") and fear of helplessness (\"Furcht vor Hilflosigkeit\"). Finally, aspects of internal validity are discussed."
