      "AbstractText": [
        "This study explored the relationship between health service utilization, informal social support and depression, anxiety and stress among the internal migrant elderly following children (IMEFC) in Weifang, China. A total of 613 IMEFC were selected using multistage cluster random sampling. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) was used to assess the depression, anxiety and stress of the IMEFC. Descriptive analysis and univariate and binary logistic regression analyses were used to clarify the correlation between health service utilization and social support and depression, anxiety and stress of the IMEFC. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress of the IMEFC was 6.9%, 7.7% and 3.4%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IMEFC who having financial stress on medical costs were more likely to feel depressed than those haven't financial stress on medical costs (OR = 6.557), while those unemployed and having no income were less likely to feel depressed than those employed (OR = 0.262), having children support were less likely to feel depressed than those haven't children support (OR = 0.257) and having comfort support were less likely to feel depressed than haven't comfort support (OR = 0.018). Trans-city migration were more likely to feel anxious than trans-county migration (OR = 3.198), having outpatient service were more likely to feel anxious than haven't experienced inpatient service (OR = 3.818), having financial stress on medical costs were more likely to feel anxious than haven't financial stress on medical costs (OR = 3.726), while having children support were less likely to feel anxious than haven't children support (OR = 0.198). Those who migrate to cure disease or rehabilitation were more likely to feel stressed than those migrated to taking care of grandchildren (OR = 12.702) and having financial stress on medical costs were more likely to feel stressed than haven't financial stress on medical costs (OR = 32.155), while having children support were less likely to feel stressed than haven't children support (OR = 0.055) and having economic support in troubles were less likely to feel stressed than haven't economic support in troubles (OR = 0.012). More effective measures should be taken to improve the accessibility and efficiency of cross-regional health insurance reimbursement, and family members should spend more time with the IMEFC to lower their psychological tension in a new environment."
