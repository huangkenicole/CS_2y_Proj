        "<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Super Skills for Life (SSL) is a transdiagnostic protocol based on cognitive-behavioral therapy designed for children with internalizing problems. The present study examined for the first time the impact of the Spanish-adapted version of SSL in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in Spanish-speaking children. <b>Design:</b> A quasi-experimental design with one group, pre- and posttest, and 1-year follow-up was conducted. Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were 119 children (42.9% female; 8-12 years) recruited from nine schools. Children completed assessments of anxiety, depression, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and the extent to which anxiety interfered with life before and after receiving the 8-session SSL, and 12-months post-intervention. <b>Results:</b> Anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly reduced at post-test and 12-month follow-up assessments. SSL also had positive impact on other symptoms assessed (e.g., interference of anxiety with children's life, peer problems, conduct problems). Overall, the long-term benefits of SSL appeared to be greater than the short-term benefits. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results of this study suggest that SSL may be useful in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and a broad range of other issues, in Spanish children."
