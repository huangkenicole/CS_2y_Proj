        "To determine the prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing treatment with free-flap (FF) reconstruction.",
        "Participants with HNC undergoing FF reconstruction were given the validated 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire prior to surgery. Patient factors and responses were analyzed.",
        "Seventy-one patients were included. Mean (SD) pre-operative PHQ-9 was 7.6 (7.04) with 34\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a024) having moderate to severe depression. Mean (SD) pre-operative GAD-7 was 6.5 (6.86) with 30\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a021) having moderate to severe anxiety.",
        "Prevalence of depression and anxiety is high in this cohort and undiagnosed in 22\u00a0% and 18\u00a0% of patients, respectively. Due to the findings, it is prudent to screen HNC patients at initial diagnosis and offer mental health services."
