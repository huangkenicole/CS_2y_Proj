        "Math anxiety (MA) is considered one of the variables that cause poor performance in contexts where mathematical competence is required.",
        "The survey involved 28 Italian students in the first year of secondary school (corresponding to grade nine of English-speaking schools and of the Italian INVALSI evaluation system). The students, examined at the beginning of the school year, scored below the threshold of sufficiency in the calculation skills assessment test. This data analysis takes into consideration the development of their math performance; the hypothesis is that the level of MA may differentiate students who are able or not able to achieve the competencies expected by the course of study.",
        "Students who transitioned from an inadequate score to a sufficient one over the school year, exhibited significantly lower levels of MA compared to students who did not score sufficient on the math test at the end of the year. However, the significant difference primarily pertained to the \"learning math\" subscale, while the \"math evaluation\" subscale showed no significant differences between the two groups.",
        "Our results suggest the possibility of using the assessment of MA levels to identify the presence and type of emotional difficulties associated with the study of mathematics. Specifically, in individuals with difficulties in learning mathematics, the presence of a dissociation between the two AMAS subscales could suggest different approaches to educational intervention."
