      "AbstractText": [
        "The transition to motherhood is a period of risk for the development of mood disorders. Postpartum anxiety has not been as thoroughly studied as other emotional disorders despite its impact on mothers and their babies. The absence of standardized programmes for early detection and specific tools for its diagnosis means postpartum anxiety is often underestimated or overshadowed. This study aimed to translate and validate the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale [PSAS] for the Spanish population and to analyse its reliability as an exploratory tool for specific anxiety in mothers.",
        "Four stages were followed in this research: translation and back-translation to obtain the Spanish version [PSAS-ES]; preliminary pilot study to explore the comprehensibility and ease of responding the items (n\u00a0=\u00a053); convergent validity analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a0644); and test-retest reliability (n\u00a0=\u00a0234).",
        "The PSAS-ES has shown to have good acceptability, convergent validity and high internal consistency with a Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient of 0.93 for the overall scale of PSAS. The four factors had good reliability. The results of test-retest was 0.86, indicating excellent stability over time in the first 16\u00a0weeks.",
        "The psychometric results show that the PSAS-ES is a valid tool to explore and detect anxiety in Spanish mothers between 0 and 16\u00a0weeks postpartum."
