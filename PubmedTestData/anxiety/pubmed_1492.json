        "The effect of test expectancy and test anxiety on the retention of prose is not yet profoundly examined in an ecologically valid learning context. The influence of test expectancy, test anxiety, and differences in intelligence on the retention of prose was addressed in the hypothesis that test anxiety would act as a moderator between test expectancy and memory retention of prose. Also examined was whether this relation would still be valid if differences in general intelligence were controlled. University freshmen (N=292) participated. Analysis indicated that test anxiety acted as a moderator between test expectancy and prose memory performance, even after controlling for differences in general intelligence. The low and high test-anxious group expecting a retention test seemed to profit from positive arousal elicited by the expectedness of a retention test. The high test-anxious group not expecting a retention test performed in a rather detrimental way on a retention test given negative arousal elicited by the unexpectedness of a retention test. Implications for further research are elaborated and discussed."
