        "Several studies have shown how COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the consequent isolation and quarantine measures could affect physical and mental well-being. Therefore, the increased request for support and assistance represents a critical challenge for clinicians requiring a reorganization of care systems. In this regard, online counselling has been identified as a useful tool in providing psychological assistance and support. Thus, the main purpose of the current study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of a single online counselling session in reducing psychopathological symptoms (i.e., state anxiety and negative affect) and increasing individual well-being and positive affect during the first Italian lockdown. Fifty-three subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive an online counselling session [Online Counselling Group (OCG)\u2009=\u200926] or to act as controls [Waiting List Group (WLG)\u2009=\u200927]. In the post-assessment, compared to WLG, the OCG showed a significant decrease in negative affect (18.04\u2009\u00b1\u20096.30 vs. 30.26\u2009\u00b1\u20098.61; F<sub>1:47</sub> \u2009=\u200929.45; p\u2009<\u2009.001; d<sub>ppc2</sub> \u2009=\u2009.92) and state anxiety (36.65\u2009\u00b1\u20098.35 vs. 48.04\u2009\u00b1\u200911.51; F<sub>1:47</sub> \u2009=\u200917.86; p\u2009<\u2009.001; d<sub>ppc2</sub> \u2009=\u2009.49). Taking into account the cyclical nature of COVID-19, with the possibility of new peaks and waves, it would be appropriate to consider the versatility and usefulness of online psychological counselling in the management of COVID-19-related distress."
