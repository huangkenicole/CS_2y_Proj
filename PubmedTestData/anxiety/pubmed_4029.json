        "To investigate the anxieties of patients undergoing oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD), colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) in relation to their demographic features, their knowledge and understanding of the procedure, its indication, and their doctors' explanation. A standard questionnaire was filled in consecutively for 280 OGD patients, 64 colonoscopy patients and 50 ERCP patients.",
        "Majority of the anxious patients were afraid of pain. There was no difference between the \"fearless\" and \"fearful\" groups in terms of source of referral and inpatient/outpatient status. However for all 3 procedures, anxious patients were significantly younger by a mean of 10 years. Females, better educated and OGD patients undergoing the procedure for the first time were more anxious but this difference was not seen with the more complex colonoscopy and ERCP. The more sophisticated ERCP seemed to instill greater anxiety amongst Malay patients. Doctors were significantly more likely to explain the indication for OGD and colonoscopy than how it would be done. This discrepancy was not seen with ERCP where the endoscopists tend to adopt a more personal approach. Most patients prefer to be sedated."
