        "Analysis of some anxious and aggressive features stemming from the highly traumatic war experiences and having as a consequence chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
        "Group psychotherapy was applied as a therapeutic approach of choice.",
        "During the psychotherapeutic process, the possibility to name and express anxiety and aggressiveness was uncovered not only as the sequels of highly traumatic war experiences but even the transgenerational transmission of frustrations and aggressive feelings. These features have constantly very strong influence on the therapist's countertransference. Some of the most prominent characteristics of these processes are described through clinical vignettes.",
        "Longer group psychotherapy is required for patients suffering from serious PTSD to develop the possibility to externalize their deep traumas and to work them through in order to reestablish connections with everyday life. During that process, the countertransferential issues disclose the most important traumatic features and encapsulations, and indicate the main topics to be addressed in patients and the therapist as well."
