        "<b>Background:</b>Today's college students are experiencing unprecedented rates of stress, anxiety, and mental health issues. As a result, college counseling centers are often overwhelmed by the demand for mental health services. <b>Methods:</b> The current study evaluated the potential for Hatha yoga classes to be used as an alternative to conventional psychotherapy for college students reporting high levels of stress and anxiety. <b>Results:</b> After 6\u2009weeks of twice-weekly, hour-long yoga classes, significant reductions in stress, anxiety, pathological worry, and rumination were reported by 7 undergraduate college students. <b>Conclusions:</b> Results of this pilot study suggest that Hatha yoga classes may serve as a widely accessible, cost-effective early intervention that can be offered as a first-line recommendation to students who are struggling with heightened levels of stress and anxiety."
