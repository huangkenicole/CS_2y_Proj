        "Oxidative stress is believed to have a role in the development of chronic diseases. It is also known that long-term night and shift work in nurses might be associated with many health-related problems like fatigue, sleep problems, anxiety and difficulties in maintaining regular lifestyles.",
        "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the changes of oxidative stress parameters and anxiety indexes of the nurses on day and night shifts.",
        "One hundred and twenty nurses in ordinary service and intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled to the study. Subjects were divided into 2 groups; group 1 (n = 60) consisted of nurses working in a day shift and group 2 (n = 60) as working in the night shift. Further, both groups were divided in to 2 groups again; group la and 2a (both n = 30) who working in the ICU, group 1b and 2b (both n = 30) in the ordinary service. Just before and the end of the shifts, blood samples were obtained to measure total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS). Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated. Anxiety index were determined at the end of the shift using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory index.",
        "Oxidative stress parameters were increased in all nurses at the end of the day and night shifts (p < 0.05). However, both in service and ICU nurses TAS, TOS, and OSI levels were not significantly different at the beginning and the end of the shifts (p > 0.05). Anxiety indexes of each ordinary service and ICU nurses were found to be similar (p > 0.05).",
        "Ordinary service and ICU nurses' oxidative stress parameters and anxiety indexes were not different and all nurses suffer the similar effects of the shifts both in day and night."
