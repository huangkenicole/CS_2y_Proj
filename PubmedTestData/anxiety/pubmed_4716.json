        "To determine the impact of classical music on the anxiety and pain perception of patients who underwent thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (TFNAB) for the first time.",
        "In a prospective randomized controlled design, TFNAB patients were randomized into the intervention and control groups. The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) before and after the procedure and the visual analog scale (VAS) after procedure were used for measuring anxiety and pain.",
        "A total of 82 patients were included. There was no significant difference between the music intervention group (n = 41) and control group (n = 41) in terms of age, gender, work status, highest education level, SAI score before TFNAB, and duration of the procedure (p > 0.05). It was observed that the anxiety level before TFNAB was higher in women in all patient groups (p = 0.009). While the SAI score decreased significantly in the music intervention group (Z = - 3.62, p < 0.001), there was no significant difference in the control group (Z = - 1.41, p = 0.157) after TFNAB. However, no significant difference was found in terms of VAS between two groups (p = 0.075). The duration of the TFNAB procedure was correlated with the change in the SAI score (r = 0.382, p < 0.001).",
        "This is the first study to examine the impact of music on patients' anxiety and pain perception during the TFNAB procedure. Despite the fact that classical music intervention did not decrease pain perception, it significantly reduced patient anxiety. Music is an easy-to-implement intervention that can be considered as an effective method for reducing patient anxiety during TFNAB."
