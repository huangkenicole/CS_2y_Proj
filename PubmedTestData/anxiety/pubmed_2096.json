        "Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy and benefits of exposure therapy in the treatment of health anxiety. However, the application of these research results to routine care has not been considered sufficiently. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of exposure therapy in the routine treatment of health anxiety patients.",
        "Data were available for 35 patients, who repeatedly filled in comprehensive general questionnaires, and those specific to health anxiety.",
        "The data analysis showed that health anxiety symptoms decreased significantly both posttreatment (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.97-1.00) and at follow-up (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.33-1.34). In addition, the scores of depressiveness, somatic symptoms, and psychological distress showed improvements with effect sizes of d\u2009=\u20090.35-0.51. Regarding the primary outcome measures for health anxiety, response rates were 51%-63%, and remission rates were 29%-43%.",
        "Exposure therapy is effective and sustainable regarding the treatment of health anxiety, even under naturalistic conditions, whereas response and remission rates are lower than for RCT."
