        "Many patients who suffer from acute chest pain are transported by ambulance. It is not known how often treatment prior to hospital admission is optimal and how optimal pain-relieving treatment is defined. It is often difficult to delineate pain from anxiety.",
        "To describe various aspects of chest pain in the pre-hospital setting with the emphasis on a) treatment and b) presumed acute coronary syndrome.",
        "In the literature search, we used PubMed and the appropriate key words. We included randomised clinical trials and observational studies.",
        "Four types of drug appear to be preferred: 1) narcotic analgesics, 2) nitrates, 3) beta-blockers and 4) benzodiazepines. Among narcotic analgesics, morphine has been associated with the relief of pain at the expense of side-effects. Alfentanil was reported to produce more rapid pain relief. Nitrates have been associated with the relief of pain with few side-effects. Beta-blockers have been reported to increase the relief of pain when added to morphine. The combination of beta-blockers and morphine has been reported to be as effective as beta-blockers alone in pain relief, but this combination therapy was associated with more side-effects. Experience from anxiety-relieving drugs such as benzodiazepines is limited. It is not known how these 4 drugs should be combined. The results indicate that various pain-relieving treatments might modify the disease.",
        "Our knowledge of the optimal treatment of chest pain and associated anxiety in the pre-hospital setting is insufficient. Recommendations from existing guidelines are limited. Large randomised clinical trials are warranted."
