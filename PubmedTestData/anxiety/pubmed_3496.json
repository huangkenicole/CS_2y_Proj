        "Patients with hematologic malignancies experience anxiety and depressive symptoms from diagnosis through survivorship. The aim of this systematic review is to determine if coping skill interventions can reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms for persons with hematologic cancer.",
        "Databases including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, APA PyschInfo, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched in June of 2021 for coping skill interventional studies with adult patients with hematologic cancer and outcomes of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Search terms, definitions, and inclusion/exclusion criteria were guided by the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, and quality appraisal utilized the Johns Hopkins Evidence Based Practice Appraisal tool. The study was registered in PROSPERO under \"CRD42021262967.\"",
        "Eleven studies met inclusion criteria with ten studies evaluating anxiety symptoms and nine studies evaluating depressive symptoms. Of ten studies with 449 participants evaluating anxiety, five studies showed significant reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), three found small to moderate effect size reductions not reaching statistical significance (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and only two showed no reduction in anxiety symptoms. Of nine studies with 429 participants evaluating depressive symptoms, three had significant reductions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), three reported small to moderate effect size reductions not reaching statistical significance (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and three found no effect on depressive symptoms. Coping interventions that were problem-focused as opposed to emotion-focused were most effective for both anxiety and depressive symptoms.",
        "This systematic review finds evidence that problem-focused coping interventions reduce anxiety symptoms among patients with hematologic malignancies, with mixed evidence for reduction of depressive symptoms. Nurses and other clinicians caring for patients with hematologic cancers may employ coping skill interventions as a potential way to mitigate anxiety and depressive symptoms.",
