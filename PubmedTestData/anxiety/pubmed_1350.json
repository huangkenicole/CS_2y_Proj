      "AbstractText": [
        "The COVID-19 pandemic and public health mitigation measures have negatively impacted individuals with eating disorders (ED). We evaluated changes in and predictors of ED symptoms, pandemic-related ED concerns, and anxiety symptoms across the first 12\u2009months of the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with self-reported EDs in the United States (US), Sweden (SE), and the Netherlands (NL).",
        "Participants in the US (N\u00a0=\u00a0510), SE (N\u2009=\u00a0982), and NL (N\u2009=\u00a0510) completed an online survey assessing ED symptoms (binge eating, restriction, compensatory behaviors, and anxiety about being unable to exercise), general anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related ED concerns about accessing food, lack of structure and social support, being in a triggering environment, and food and treatment costs. In the US and NL, respondents completed surveys beginning April 2020 and continuing monthly for a year. In SE, respondents completed baseline surveys in May 2020, a six-month follow-up around December 2020, and a 12-month follow-up in May 2021.",
        "Three patterns emerged: (1) a curvilinear course with the highest level of symptoms at baseline, declining through November 2020, and increasing through the rest of the year; (2) a linear declining course over time; and (3) a stable course with no changes. Worries about COVID-19 infection, lockdown, concerns about lack of structure and social support, and concerns about accessing food consistent with one's recovery meal plan predicted increases in ED symptoms.",
        "ED symptoms tracked with pandemic-related concerns in people with EDs. Conceptualizing predictors of symptoms may inform therapy and public health resources that reduce the impact of pandemics on mental health.",
        "Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative impacts on people with eating disorders, including amplification of mental health symptoms and stressors around peak periods of infection and COVID-19 restrictions. These findings inform medical providers, policy-makers, and community-based supports about the information and resource needs of this group to ensure efficient dissemination in future public health emergencies and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
