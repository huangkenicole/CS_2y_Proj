        "With the normalization process during the COVID-19 pandemic, senior nursing students who receive applied nursing courses in Turkey shifted to face-to-face education. Clinical practices during the pandemic caused nursing students to experience fear and anxiety.",
        "This study examines senior nursing students' fear and anxiety levels regarding clinical practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The researchers of this descriptive and cross-sectional study tried to reach the entire population, and the study was completed with 124 students who agreed to participate in the study. The data were collected using a 12-question personal information form, the 21-question Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the 7-question Fear of COVID-19 Scale on Google Forms.",
        "The participants' mean Fear of COVID-19 Scale score was 20.00\u2009\u00b1\u20097.71 (medium level). Their mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score was 14.23\u2009\u00b1\u200915.44 (mild anxiety). A positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and anxiety.",
        "The nursing students had a mild level of anxiety and a moderate level of fear of COVID-19 during their clinical practices."
