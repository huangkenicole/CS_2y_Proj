        "The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological management of anxiety as an alternative to long-term benzodiazepine medication. Fifty patients were identified who had been taking benzodiazepines continuously for at least one year. No significant differences were found between patients who joined a treatment group and patients who were simply advised by letter to cut down their pills. Patients gave a variety of reasons for initially requiring medication and somewhat different reasons for needing to maintain chemotherapy, which suggested that pill-taking might be self-maintaining through withdrawal symptoms."
