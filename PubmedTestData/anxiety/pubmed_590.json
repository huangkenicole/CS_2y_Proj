      "AbstractText": [
        "The Unified Protocol for Children (UP-C) is a transdiagnostic Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy group intervention for children and caregivers targeting the treatment of children's emotional disorders (EDs). The present study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the UP-C in the Portuguese population using a single-armed design. The participants were 32 children (6-12 years of age) with an ED (anxiety and/or depressive disorder) as a main diagnosis and their parents. All participants received the UP-C intervention and were assessed at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 3 months posttreatment. Children, parents, the clinicians, and an external observer completed questionnaires to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the UP-C (e.g., satisfaction, motivation, and adherence). Children and parents also completed self-report measures assessing the children's anxiety and depression and its interference and severity. The results of the present study support the feasibility and acceptability of the UP-C in Portugal; low dropout rates, high adherence rates, and high levels of child and parent satisfaction and motivation were observed. Moreover, significant reductions over time in children's levels of anxiety and/or depression and of its interference and severity were found and were maintained after 3 months of follow-up. These results are promising and warrant a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT)."
