      "AbstractText": [
        "Depression and anxiety are common mental health disorders among adolescents and negatively impact their physical and mental health. Depression and anxiety also exert a tremendous economic burden to society. But in China, there is no systematic review to state the exact prevalence of adolescent depression and anxiety; there is also a lack of systematic reviews of factors that influence depression and anxiety. Hence, in this systematic review, we aim to summarise the current evidence of the prevalence of and factors influencing depression and anxiety among Chinese adolescents.",
        "This protocol was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. We will comprehensively search four English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL in EBSCO interface, PsycINFO in ProQuest interface) and three Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang and SinoMed) for studies from inception to 31 August 2022. Screening for eligible studies and data extraction will be conducted by two reviewers independently, and all discrepancies will be resolved through group discussion.",
        "Because this is a review of published studies, no ethical approval is required. The results will be reported in a peer-reviewed journal or disseminated at relevant conferences.",
