        "This study examined the impact of trait anxiety on self-control behavior using the cold pressor task. In addition to cold pressor tolerance, effects were measured in terms of physiological arousal and self-evaluations. Forty-six female subjects screened for high and low trait anxiety were given two trials of the cold pressor task, and between trials, they were given either self-control or non-self-control training. As expected, self-control training resulted in increased pain tolerance and decreased physiological arousal. Although anxiety did not influence behavioral tolerance, high trait anxious subjects receiving self-control training made more negative self-evaluations and had higher levels of physiological arousal. These results suggest that anxiety may disrupt the use of self-control strategies in coping with pain."
