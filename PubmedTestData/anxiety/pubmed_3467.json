      "AbstractText": [
        "Prostate biopsy (PB) is an essential step in the diagnosis and active surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). Transperineal PB (TP-PB) is now the recommended approach and is mostly conducted under local anesthesia. However, this procedure can potentially cause anxiety for patients, given the oncological context and the fear of peri-procedural pain and complications. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the currently available tools for the management of peri-interventional anxiety during TP-PB, with a particular emphasis on the potential role of virtual reality (VR) in this setting.",
        "In TP-PB, preoperative anxiety can lead to increased pain perception, longer procedure time, and decreased patient satisfaction. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have been explored to reduce anxiety, such as premedication, deep sedation, education, relaxation techniques, hypnosis, and music therapy, albeit with mixed results. VR has recently emerged in the technological armamentarium for managing pain and anxiety, and the efficiency of this technology has been evaluated in various medical fields, including pediatrics, gastroenterology, urology, gynecology, and psychiatry.",
        "Despite the paucity of available data, VR appears to be a safe and effective technique in reducing anxiety in many procedures, even in frail patients. No studies have evaluated the role of VR in TP-PB. Future research should thus explore the optimal way to implement VR technology and any potential benefits for TP-PB patients."
