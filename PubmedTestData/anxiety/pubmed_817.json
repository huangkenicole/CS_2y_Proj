        "Anxiety is one of the common yet underdiagnosed mental health problems of Americans; as many as 20% of people seeking primary care have symptoms of treatable anxiety disorders. Untreated anxiety increases costly visits to urgent care. Clinicians need to screen for anxiety among patients at risk who have physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset, palpitations, muscle aches, tension, and insomnia. Other diagnostic clues include restlessness, nervousness, phobias, trembling, fatigue, and shaking. Onset typically occurs in the 20s but may occur at any age. Symptoms of two anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder, are discussed. A combination of treatments including antidepressant and anxiolytic medications, behavioral treatments, education (e.g., self-management, relaxation), and counseling (e.g., coping strategies) have high success rates; psychiatric consultations or referrals are useful."
