        "Virtual reality has been used to alleviate pain and anxiety in a variety of medical procedures. The authors sought to explore the effects of virtual reality in common awake minor plastic surgery procedures where children may experience discomfort.",
        "A randomized controlled trial compared virtual reality to standard-of-care distraction among children aged 6 to 16 years undergoing awake minor plastic surgery procedures at a quaternary children's hospital. Primary outcome was change in Faces Pain Scale-Revised pain score, and secondary outcomes included change in Venham Situational Anxiety Scale score, procedure duration, administration of local anesthetic, and pain/anxiety management satisfaction.",
        "Mean pain and anxiety scores were similar in both groups (p = 0.60 and p = 0.18, respectively), and procedure duration was shorter with virtual reality (22 minutes versus 29 minutes; p = 0.002). Duration remained shorter in a linear regression model accounting for procedure type (p = 0.01). Similar proportions of children received additional local anesthetic after the initial dose (virtual reality, n = 6; standard of care, n = 9; p = 0.19) and median pain management satisfaction was similar (virtual reality, 9 of 10; standard of care, 9 of 10; p = 0.41). Median anxiety management satisfaction was similar (virtual reality, 9 of 10; standard of care, 9 of 10; p = 0.05). Younger children reported more \"fun\" than older children with virtual reality (p = 0.02). Surgeons reported interest \"using virtual reality again\" in 83 percent of cases.",
        "The use of virtual reality for awake pediatric plastic surgery reduced procedure time but not pain or anxiety compared to standard of care in children aged 6 to 16 years. Virtual reality was safe and well-liked and should be considered as an additional tool. Increased efficiency may allow more cases to be performed.",
