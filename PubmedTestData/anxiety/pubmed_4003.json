        "<b>Purpose:</b> Preoperative anxiety over cataract surgery affects a large number of patients. This study aims to evaluate the effect of slow-stroke back massage on the anxiety of candidates for cataract surgery. <b>Design:</b> Quasi-experimental study. <b>Methods:</b> This study was a quasi-experimental study, which involved 60 candidates for cataract surgery referred to Amiralmomenin Hospital, Zabol in Iran between August 1, 2015, and March 30, 2016. These patients were randomly divided into two groups of slow-stroke back massage group (n=30) and control group (n=30). After obtaining an informed consent, the anxiety levels were measured by the Spielberger state trait anxiety questionnaire in the slow-stroke back massage group and the control group on the morning of the surgery before and immediately after the massage. SPSS software version 22 was used for data analysis. Independent t-test and chi-square test were used to compare the data. <b>Findings:</b> According to the results, there was a significant difference between the anxiety levels of the patients in the intervention group before and after the massage (p < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Based on the results of this study, Slow-stroke-back massage, which is a low-cost and safe method, significantly reduces anxiety in patients who are candidates for cataract surgery."
