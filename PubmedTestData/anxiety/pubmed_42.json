        "The prenatal period can be associated with an increase in distress and anxiety. Research indicates that impaired mental well-being influences the development of prenatal maternal-fetal bonding, which manifests in representations, emotions and behaviors. However, the impact of prenatal anxieties on maternal-fetal bonding is still not fully understood, partly due to heterogeneity in the conceptualization and the measurement of both constructs. The aims of this review were to identify studies assessing the relation between both constructs and to investigate direction and size of effects for different types of prenatal anxiety and conceptualizations of maternal-fetal bonding.",
        "A systematic search was carried out on January 7, 2017, and updated on October 23, 2017, based on four electronic databases and a targeted reference search. Of the 3845 identified publications, K\u202f=\u202f31 studies fit the eligibility criteria.",
        "While components of maternal-fetal bonding centering around pregnancy or maternal role were not affected, the quality of perceived emotional proximity to the child, as assessed by the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale, was impaired by anxieties across studies. Associations were overall negative and of low to moderate size.",
        "Studies focusing on high-risk subpopulations were excluded. Included studies mostly assessed samples from Western societies, which limits the generalizability of results to non-Western cultures.",
        "The quality of perceived emotional proximity to the fetus was consistently impaired by anxiety. Nevertheless, varying effect sizes indicate a more complex association that is influenced by underlying confounders. Multivariate analyses are needed to improve the understanding of the interacting factors that influence maternal-fetal bonding."
