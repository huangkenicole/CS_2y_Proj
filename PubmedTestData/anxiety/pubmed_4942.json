      "AbstractText": [
        "Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), as a gold and standard treatment for fatal cardiac arrhythmia, may lead to some physical and psychological problems for the patients. Therefore, performing some interventions to reduce or eliminate these issues is crucial. This study aimed to determine the effect of virtual interactive nurse-led support group intervention on fatigue, shock anxiety, and acceptance of ICD patients.",
        "This is a clinical trial study on 72 patients with ICD. They were randomly allocated to the intervention (n\u2009=\u200936) and control (n\u2009=\u200936) groups. A virtual interactive nurse-led support group intervention through WhasApp was performed for one month. Multidimensional fatigue inventory, Florida Shock Anxiety Scale, and Florida Patient Acceptance Scale were used. Data were analyzed to perform the analysis of data through SPSS, using independent and paired-t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, and ANCOVA.",
        "Before the intervention, no significant difference was observed between the two groups with regard to fatigue, shock anxiety, and ICD acceptance. However, after the intervention, a significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to fatigue, shock anxiety, and ICD acceptance (P\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "This study showed that virtual interactive nurse-led support group intervention reduced fatigue and shock anxiety and improved the ICD acceptance.",
        "This flexible, accessible, and interactive nurse-led support group intervention is suggested to be used for ICD patients.",
        "This trial was registered and approved by Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Trial Id: 60,738, date: (24/02/2022). ( https://www.irct.ir/trial/60738 )."
