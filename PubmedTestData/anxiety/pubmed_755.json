        "Sixty adult patients: 30 patients received music during bronchoscopy and 30 control subjects received no music.",
        "The study population had baseline state anxiety levels similar to those previously reported in surgical patients (42.6 +/- 13 vs 42.7 +/- 14; p value, not significant [NS]) and higher than those reported in normal working adults (42.6 +/- 13 vs 34.4 +/- 10; p < 0.001). Experimental and control groups were similar in patient and procedure-related characteristics and baseline pre-FFB state and trait anxiety scores. Although trait anxiety scores decreased significantly after the procedure (pooled post-FFB scores of 32.6 +/- 10 vs pre-FFB scores of 35.5 +/- 11; p < 0.001), no reductions were noted in state anxiety (pooled post-FFB scores of 42.8 +/- 13 vs pre-FFB scores of 42.6 +/- 13; p value, NS). More importantly, playing music through headphones during FFB did not result in a statistically or clinically significant reduction in either state or trait anxiety when compared to control subjects.",
