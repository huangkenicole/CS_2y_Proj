        "The current world scenario of apprehension and suffering for the physical and economic health of people, has generated a situation of anxiety accompanied by an emotional overload of stress, often difficult to manage. The emerging Long-Covid syndrome has placed the emphasis on the persistence of clinical factors in some individuals, beyond the time which is normally considered acceptable for healing. This article aims to provide a contribution in the research of the possible causes related to the onset of Long-Covid syndrome, as well as in the understanding of the peculiar type of link between the various psycho-physical aspects and the health condition, while focusing attention on new ways of coping and treatment."
