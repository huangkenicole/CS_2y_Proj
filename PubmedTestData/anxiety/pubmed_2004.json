        "The purpose is to determine the effect of therapeutic touch (TT) on the sleep quality and anxiety of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) disease.",
        "103 patients were randomized in to the two groups: the experimental group, and the control group. In this randomized control study, the patients with COPD in the experimental group were given TT for 10\u00a0min between 18:00 and 20:00, one session every day for three consecutive days.",
        "When the experimental group was compared to control group following the intervention, the decrease in the levels of anxiety (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and increase in the sleep quality (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found to be significant.",
        "As a result of the study, it was determined that TT reduced anxiety level and improved sleep quality in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT04842903."
