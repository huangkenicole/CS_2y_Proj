        "Substantial evidence is emerging regarding the broad societal and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but little is known about whether infected individuals are differently affected.",
        "We evaluated psychological differences between individuals who do vs. do not report testing positive for COVID-19.",
        "An online survey was offered to adults (\u226518\u2009years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by a provider within a large integrated-delivery healthcare system, enrolled in COVID-19-related clinical trials at the healthcare system, or responded to targeted local distribution. Measures assessed included the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5.",
        "Of 487 respondents, 43% reported testing positive for COVID-19, including 11% requiring hospitalization. Overall rates of general anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress were 34% and 16%, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Prevalence of depression was higher among respondents reporting a positive COVID-19 test (52% vs. 31%). This difference persisted after controlling for respondent characteristics (odds ratio = 3.7, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01).",
        "People who report testing positive for COVID-19, even those not requiring hospitalization, have increased risk for depression. Mental health care screening and services should be offered to individuals testing positive, facilitating early intervention."
