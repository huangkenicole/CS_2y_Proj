        "Healthcare providers may experience a high level of stress, fatigue, and anxiety originating from different factors. Mind-body therapies, which include many interventions, have been proposed to alleviate these conditions. These interventions have been reported to decrease the level of stress, and the negative outcomes associated with these factors: high burnout rate, and poor quality of care for patients. Although research validating the effectiveness of healthcare providers' use of mind-body therapies to care for themselves is emerging, there is little focus on barriers and facilitators that healthcare providers encounter with these mind-body practices, thereby questioning the feasibility and sustainability of these interventions. As such, this systematic review examined the barriers preventing healthcare providers from using mind-body interventions to care for themselves and ways that it has been facilitated. Overall, 12 studies addressed the research question with a limited focus on the facilitators and barriers of the use of mind-body therapies."
