        "Young adulthood (18 to 34) is a time of transitional change where individuals can be highly susceptible to mental health concerns. Despite similar vulnerabilities to their adolescent counterparts, the psychological outcomes for young adults following disasters are not well understood.",
        "This scoping review aimed to explore the literature on the psychological outcomes for young adults after disaster events.",
        "A systematic search of the literature was conducted in seven electronic databases, including PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, PILOTS, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest dissertations and theses global. In total, 91 reports from 15 countries were included.",
        "Findings suggested that young adults experience a range of psychological consequences after disasters, including posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, and other psychological outcomes, such as general/non-specific psychological distress. Pre-disaster, peri-disaster, and post-disaster factors were also found to influence the degree of psychological outcomes experienced by young adults, including prior psychological functioning and disaster exposure, among a host of other factors.",
        "Future research is recommended to better understand young adults' psychological outcomes, experiences, and service needs following disasters."
