        "<b>Objective:</b> To assess the psychological condition of men at the start of the infertility work-up. <b>Methods:</b> Men seeking an infertility evaluation for the first time were recruited. Depression and anxiety symptoms and subjective psychological burden were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analog scale (VAS). <b>Results:</b> Data from 113 patients were analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 33.3 (range: 23-54) years, whereas the mean duration of infertility was 16.3 (range: 0-96) months. Results from the BDI and STAI were 2.24 (SD: \u00b13.18) and 33.74 (SD: \u00b18.04). Mild depressive symptoms were found in 4.5% of patients, whereas anxiety reached an abnormal level in 4.9%. There were significant correlations between the results from the BDI score and the duration of infertility (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.024), whereas the STAI and VAS scores showed no similar connection (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.142 and <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.261, respectively). Among patients with infertility longer than 2\u00a0years, mild depressive symptoms occurred in 23.1%. <b>Conclusion:</b> Among men, the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were low at the start of the infertility work-up. Depressive symptom levels increased significantly with the duration of infertility, whereas anxiety levels and VAS scores did not demonstrate a similar correlation."
