        "Death anxiety is a common phenomenon in all societies. Older adults may be more prone to death anxiety than their younger counterparts; however, death anxiety among older adults is not well understood. This study explores the relationship between meaning in life, self-esteem, and death anxiety in senior citizens in China.",
        "A total of 283 older adults participated in this study; data were collected via the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Death Anxiety Scale.",
        "Results show that the dimensions of meaning in life, presence of meaning (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.43, p\u2009<\u00a00.01), search for meaning (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.31, p\u2009<\u00a00.01), and self-esteem (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.54, p\u2009<\u00a00.01) were each negatively correlated with death anxiety. Regression analysis reveals that meaning in life significantly predicted self-esteem and death anxiety (F\u2009=\u00a045.70, p\u2009<\u00a00.01; R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.33). Path analysis indicated that self-esteem either completely or partially mediated the effects of meaning in life on death anxiety in older adults.",
        "Overall, meaning in life appears to be significantly correlated with death anxiety in older adults, and self-esteem can mediate this effect."
