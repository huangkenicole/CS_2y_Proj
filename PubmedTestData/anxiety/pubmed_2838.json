        "To undertake an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of anxiety after stroke and integrate the findings with those reported previously.",
        "Multiple databases were searched in May 2018 and 53 new studies were included following dual independent sifting and data extraction. These were combined with 44 previous studies to form a combined data set of 97 studies, comprising 22,262 participants. Studies using interview methods were of higher quality. Rates of anxiety by interview were 18.7% (95% confidence interval 12.5, 24.9%) and 24.2% (95% confidence interval 21.5, 26.9%) by rating scale. Rates of anxiety did not lower meaningfully up to 24 months after stroke. Eight different anxiety subtypes were also reported.",
        "This review confirms that anxiety occurs in around one in four patients (by rating scale) and one in five patients (by interview). More research on anxiety subtypes is needed for an informed understanding of its effects and the development of interventions."
