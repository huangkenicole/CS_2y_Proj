        "This issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychology: In Session is devoted to suicidality in clinical practice, with coverage of a broad range of topics. After summarizing some of the problems and recent advances in clinical suicidology, I provide a brief overview of the articles. Included are the more broadly defined issues of risk management and psychotherapy with suicidal individuals, along with more specific topics such as risk assessment, no-suicide contracts, and the risk of suicide with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by children and adolescents. Most of the articles feature case vignettes and provide practitioners with clinical recommendations, and all of the articles have clear and important clinical implications."
