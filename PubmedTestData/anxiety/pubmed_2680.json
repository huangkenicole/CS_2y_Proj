      "AbstractText": [
        "Perinatal mental illness presents a significant health burden to both patients and families. Many factors are hypothesized to increase the incidence of perinatal depression and anxiety in the fetal surgical population, including uncertain fetal prognosis and inherent risks of surgery and preterm delivery.",
        "This study aimed to determine the incidence and disease course of postpartum depression and anxiety in the fetal surgery population.",
        "A retrospective medical record review study was conducted of fetal surgery patients delivering between November 2016 and November 2021 at an academic level IV perinatal healthcare center. Demographics and surgical, obstetrical, and psychiatric diagnoses were abstracted. Standard descriptive analyses were performed.",
        "Eligible patients were identified (N=119). Fetal surgery was performed at a mean gestational age of 22.8 weeks (standard deviation, 4.11). Laser ablation of placental anastomoses (n=51) and in utero myelomeningocele repair (n=22) were the most common procedures. Of 119 patients, 34 (28.6%) were diagnosed with preexisting depression or anxiety, with 19 (55.9%) and 17 (50.0%) on baseline medication for depression or anxiety, respectively, before surgery. Of 85 patients, 23 (27.1%) without a history of anxiety or depression had new identification of one or both after delivery. Of note, 2 patients experienced suicidal ideation after delivery. Of the 119 patients, 8 (6.7%) and 12 (10.1%) initiated a new psychiatric medication during or after pregnancy, respectively, and 19 (16.0%) received a therapy referral. Among patients with baseline anxiety or depression, 20 of 34 patients (58.8%) experienced an exacerbation after delivery, 9 of 34 patients (26.5%) were referred for therapy, 9 of 34 patients (26.5%) were changing dose or medication for anxiety, and 11 of 34 patients (32.4%) were changing dose or medication for depression. Of the 119 patients, 24 (20.2%) experienced new or worsening depression or anxiety after the standard 6-week postpartum visit.",
        "Among patients undergoing fetal surgery, a high incidence of postpartum depression and anxiety was identified, with most patients with prepregnancy anxiety or depression experiencing exacerbation after delivery. The timeframe to clinical presentation with depression or anxiety symptoms may be delayed beyond the traditional 6-week postpartum period and into the first postpartum year. This observation could be attributed to de novo postpartum exacerbation or a lack of standardized treatment approaches earlier in the disease course or antepartum period. Understanding effective longitudinal supportive interventions is an essential next step."
