        "This scoping review describes the research-based mindfulness intervention on anxiety, distress, and depression. The search strategy retrieved articles published in English from 2014 to 2019 and were retrieved across Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. The PRISMA-Scr checklist is a tool to evaluate the quality of the articles. The selection criteria initially included all original articles in English, with 1,527 that were related to mindfulness intervention for anxiety, distress, and depression. A total of 490 full texts were retrieved, and after the abstracts were reviewed, 124 full-text articles were included for eligibility, and the final eight studies were determined. The articles were reviewed and screened for relevance to mindfulness intervention in reducing anxiety, distress, and depression among those with chronic diseases. The results have shown that mindfulness intervention reduces anxiety, distress, and depression among patients with chronic diseases. The review contributes further insight into the fact that mindfulness intervention is also appropriate for other conditions to facilitate reducing psychological symptoms."
