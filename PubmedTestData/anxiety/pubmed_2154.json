        "This study examined the effects of a guided online acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed family caregivers of persons living with dementia and explored the experiences of these caregivers in the ACT intervention.",
        "Seven family caregivers experiencing psychological distress individually participated in 10 ACT videoconference sessions guided by a trained coach. Quantitative data, such as psychological distress, burden, and ACT processes, were collected at pretest and posttest and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Individual interviews were conducted at posttest and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.",
        "Statistically significant reductions were found in depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and burden (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.05) with medium effect sizes. ACT sessions helped caregivers gain renewed strength by: being equipped with resources to use under distress throughout the caregiving journey; being more self-compassionate and taking care of one's self; and being more patient with relatives with dementia.",
        "Findings contribute to the limited evidence in guided online ACT for caregivers of persons living with dementia. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to evaluate the efficacy of guided online ACT.",
        "Guided online ACT may reduce depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and burden of family caregivers of persons living with dementia."
