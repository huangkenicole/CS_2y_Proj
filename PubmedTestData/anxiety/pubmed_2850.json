        "Psychosocial strategies are commonly used to alleviate anxiety and depression in patients with prostate cancer. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results.",
        "This study examined the effects of psychosocial strategies on anxiety and depression in prostate cancer patients.",
        "A systematic literature review was conducted using 4 English databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and PsycInfo) and 2 Chinese databases (Wanfang data and Chinese Electronic Periodical Service) with predetermined keyword searches. We first evaluated 8144 titles and/or abstracts. Fourteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. The criteria for study inclusion were as follows: (1) randomized controlled trial design; (2) control group received usual or standard care; (3) focus on testing psychosocial strategies to improve anxiety and depression symptoms; and (4) studies conducted with prostate cancer patients at any stage of the disease.",
        "The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. Only 35.7% of studies were regarded as high quality. The majority of studies (85.7%) delivered informational and educational or cognitive-behavioral interventions. The results show that psychosocial strategies have a substantial effect on reducing anxiety 3 months after intervention (standard mean difference -1.13, p<0.0001) and have a short-term effect on depression symptoms (immediately after intervention: standard mean difference -0.43, p<0.001; 3 months after intervention: standard mean difference -0.78, p=0.04).",
        "The results indicate that psychosocial strategies were more effective in reducing anxiety and depression compared with routine care, although the effect was not sustainable. However, high-quality methodologies, longer follow-up designs, and innovative psychosocial strategies are suggested for further study."
