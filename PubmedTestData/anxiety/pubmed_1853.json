        "To investigate anxiety and depression levels in prosthetic eye-wearing patients using standardized psychometric instruments, to define factors associated with these psychological diseases, and to identify a potential healthcare gap.",
        "A total of 295 prosthetic eye wearers were screened using the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Scores of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were correlated with scores of general physical and mental health functioning, vision-related quality of life, appearance-related distress, appearance-related social function, and further biosocial factors.",
        "Five patients (2%) had a pre-diagnosed anxiety disorder, and 20 patients (7%) had a pre-diagnosed depression. However, our screening revealed 26 patients (9%) with anxiety symptoms, 31 patients (11%) with depression symptoms, and 40 patients (14%) suffering from both anxiety and depression symptoms. This underdiagnosing for both anxiety and depression disorders was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Higher GAD-7 scores were significantly associated with higher PHQ-9 scores, lower appearance-related social function, lower mental health functioning, and female gender (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.021, respectively). Higher PHQ-9 scores were significantly associated with lower physical and mental health functioning, higher educational degree, and non-traumatic eye loss (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.038, respectively).",
        "Anxiety and depression disorders seem to be underdiagnosed in prosthetic eye wearers and to have higher incidence compared with the general population. Therefore, a psychometric screening should be routinely implemented in the clinical care. For a successful long-term rehabilitation, integrated care by a multidisciplinary team including ophthalmic plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, ocularists, general practitioners, and psychologists is essential."
