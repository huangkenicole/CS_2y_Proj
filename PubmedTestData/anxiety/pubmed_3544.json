        "This study examines the effect of hypnotherapy on exam anxiety among first-year nursing students. Nursing students have high tendency to experience stress and anxiety. Anxiety therapy which encompasses mind and body would be helpful for them.",
        "Sixty first-year nursing students participated in this interventional study. The hypnotherapy sessions started eight weeks prior to second exam. Outcome of hypnotherapy were assessed by measuring the exam anxiety\u00a0score using TAI and clinical measurements (serum cortisol and vital signs). The measurements were done twice, there are two exams, where first exam and measurement\u00a0were 1\u00a0day before exam (without hypnotherapy) and the second exam and measurement were 1\u00a0day before exam (with hypnotherapy).",
        "The mean difference of exam anxiety score and serum cortisol level between pre and post hypnotherapy sessions was statistically significant.",
        "This study found that hypnotherapy is an effective tool in the management of exam anxiety among the nursing students."
