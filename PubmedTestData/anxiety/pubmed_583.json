        "Anxiety is the most common mental health problem in the United States. Most patients with anxiety seek treatment from primary care physicians, who are generally familiar with the pharmacologic management of anxiety. However, many problems are associated with the use of antianxiety medications, and increasing evidence shows that certain nondrug strategies are effective, particularly in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The key features of nondrug treatment can be summarized under the mnemonic \"A-E-I-O-U.\" The physician assesses the nature and causes of the anxiety; educates the patient about the causes and management of anxiety; intervenes by teaching specific, effective anxiety-control techniques; observes and helps the patient monitor progress and, finally, helps the patient achieve understanding of anxiety and ways to prevent recurrence."
