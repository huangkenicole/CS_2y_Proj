        "Death anxiety and more severe forms of thanatophobia are encountered frequently in the clinical population. However, approaches that allow behavioral solutions to these experiences are conspicuously absent in the literature. From an operant perspective, death anxiety arises from repeated exposures to direct and implicit forms of the statement \"I will die\". It is the semantic equivalent of a conditioned suppression paradigm. Historically, the human organism has attempted to reduce the aversive consequences of this reinforcement schedule by extinguishing one of its three components. The \"solutions\" characterize the fundamental philosophical and religious treatments of death anxiety. A behavioral semantics approach is proposed as suitable for dealing with death anxiety of a religious, educated young adults, particularly those dying of terminal diseases."
