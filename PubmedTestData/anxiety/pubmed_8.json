        "The main objective of this study was a detailed comparison of the level of anxiety about surgery and anesthesia. Other objectives included the assessment of the prevalence and intensity of preoperative anxiety.",
        "This cross-sectional single-center survey used the validated Amsterdam anxiety and information scale (APAIS) and a modified numeric rating scale (mNRS) to assess preoperative anxiety, anxiety about surgery and anxiety about anesthesia. Prevalences and intensities of anxieties were predominantly analyzed descriptively.",
        "3200 patients were enrolled and 3087 (57% females) were analyzed. 92.6% reported preoperative anxiety according to APAIS scores. The average total APAIS anxiety score (APAIS-A-T) was 9.9 (SD 3.6). 40.5% reported high anxiety (defined as APAIS-A-T\u202f>\u202f10). Mean anxiety about surgery (APAIS-A-Su) was higher than mean anxiety about anesthesia (APAIS-A-An): 5.5 (SD 2.1) vs. 4.3 (SD 1.9), p\u202f<\u202f0.0001. Accordingly, more patients were substantially more afraid (score difference\u202f>\u202f2) of surgery (642, 20.8%, 95% CI 19.4-22.3) than of anesthesia (48, 1.6%, 95% CI 1.2-2.1).",
        "Preoperative anxiety is still very common among adult patients scheduled to undergo an elective procedure. Therefore, it should be evaluated routinely. Anxiety about surgery and anxiety about anesthesia differ in many patients. For this reason, anxiety about surgery and anxiety about anesthesia should be assessed separately. This would allow providing a more individualized support of patients to cope with their anxiety and could require particular attention by the surgeon or the anesthetist."
