        "Extensive literature has shown the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in treating perinatal depression, but little is known about the effectiveness of its technology-based version.",
        "The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in women suffering from or at risk of experiencing perinatal depression.",
        "Six electronic databases were searched until February 2023 for articles published in English. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistics and Cochran's Q chi-squared test. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed, and quality appraisals at the study and outcome levels were conducted.",
        "A total of 16 randomized controlled trials were included in the review. Results from meta-analyses suggest that technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy has a medium effect in reducing perinatal depressive symptoms and a small effect in reducing perinatal anxiety symptoms. Overall, women suffering from or at risk of perinatal depression may benefit from technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy.",
        "Future interventions can be improved by addressing both perinatal depression and anxiety, paying more attention to antenatal women to prevent postnatal mental health issues, and using self-guided mobile applications for accessibility."
