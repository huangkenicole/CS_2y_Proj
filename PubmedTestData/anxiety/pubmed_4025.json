        "Contrary to patients, the psychological impact of functional seizures to caregivers has not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the rates and determinants of depression and anxiety in caregivers of patients with functional seizures.",
        "Patients with functional seizures and their caregivers completed surveys about demographic, disease-related, and psychosocial characteristics. Rates and determinants of depression and anxiety were evaluated using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventory scores as dependent variables and patient and caregiver characteristics as independent variables.",
        "Twenty-nine patients (76% female, mean age of 37\u2009years) and their caregivers (59% female, mean age of 43\u2009years) were recruited. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression were present in 96% of patients (96% depression, 92% anxiety) and 59% of caregivers (52% depression, 50% anxiety). Specifically, 31% of caregivers manifested mild depression, 14% moderate depression, and 7% severe depression, whereas 48% were not depressed. Similarly, 14% of caregivers manifested mild anxiety, 29% moderate anxiety, and 7% severe anxiety, whereas 50% were not anxious. Patient and caregiver depression levels strongly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a0.73, p\u2009<\u2009.0001). The presence of anxiety and depression in the caregiver was associated with male patient gender (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), patient depression level (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002), the caregiver being a parent or sibling (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), and caregiver burden (p\u00a0=\u00a0.0009).",
        "Caregivers of patients with functional seizures experience high rates of anxiety and depression, explained by specific demographic and psychosocial factors that could act as intervention targets."
