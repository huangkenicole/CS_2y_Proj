        "The Mindfulness-Based Program for Infertility (MBPI) was developed for people facing infertility and proved effective in cultivating mindfulness skills, improving infertility self-efficacy, and decreasing depression, shame, entrapment, and defeat feelings. Fifty-five women attended the MBPI sessions and completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and experiential avoidance at post-MBPI (T1), 6-month follow-up (T2), and 7-year follow-up (T3). There were significant direct time effects regarding experiential avoidance (F\u00a0=\u00a03.81; p\u00a0<\u00a00.033; \u03b7<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.08), the mindfulness facets describing (F\u00a0=\u00a03.54; p\u00a0=\u00a00.037; \u03b7<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.13), acting with awareness (F\u00a0=\u00a06.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; \u03b7<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.22), nonjudging of inner experience (F\u00a0=\u00a010.66; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; \u03b7<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.31), and depressive symptoms (F\u00a0=\u00a04.85; p\u00a0=\u00a00.020; \u03b7<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.10). There was an increase in the describing facet from T1 to T3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). The act with awareness facet increased from T1 to T2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and from T1 to T3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), as well as the nonjudging of inner experience facet (T1 to T2 [p\u00a0=\u00a00.030] and T1 to T3 [p\u00a0=\u00a00.002]). Experiential avoidance decreased from T1 to T3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Post-MBPI scores were maintained at T2 and T3 concerning anxiety symptoms and the observing and no-reactivity mindfulness facets. There were long-term effects of MBPI on mindfulness and experiential avoidance. Moreover, therapeutic gains were maintained regarding depression and anxiety symptoms, independently of the reproductive outcome."
