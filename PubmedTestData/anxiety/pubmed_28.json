        "Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to reason about mental states, declines in later life. While anxiety symptoms may predict ToM abilities, the nature of associations requires more elucidation. Further, it is unknown whether age group moderates associational patterns. We examined associations between anxiety symptoms (linear and curvilinear) and cognitive ToM (C-ToM) and affective ToM (A-ToM); and moderation by age group (older vs. younger adults).",
        "In a sample of healthy younger (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200990, M<sub>age</sub> = 20.17\u2009years) and older adults (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200987, M<sub>age</sub> = 71.52), we used hierarchical regressions with polynomial and interaction terms to assess the association between anxiety symptoms and ToM in younger and older adults.",
        "Anxiety symptoms were associated with C-ToM but not A-ToM. Age group interacted linearly with anxiety (\u03b2 = -1.64, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.02), and with anxiety's quadratic polynomial (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.84, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.04). The inverted-U shaped association in younger adults (highest C-ToM at moderate anxiety) contrasted with older adults' linear decline in C-ToM with increasing anxiety.",
        "We highlight the importance of anxiety symptoms for predicting ToM, and clarify that associations vary by age. Elucidating associations may be critical to developing interventions that improve social wellbeing."
