      "AbstractText": [
        "Magnetic resonance often produces feelings of anxiety before, or during, the examination. The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and potential causes of anxiety in cancer patients undergoing whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI).",
        "This monocentric study recruited 70 cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo WB-MRI for detection, staging or therapy monitoring. At baseline (prior to the WB-MRI), assessments were performed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y 1), Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), Big Five Inventory (BIF-10) and Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), while at the end of the WB-MRI examination the patients repeated the STAI-Y 1 questionnaire and were asked to indicate their preference between WB-MRI and computed tomography.",
        "We found a positive correlation between pre- and post-examination STAI-Y 1 scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.536, p\u2009<\u2009.0001), with no significant difference between them. Pre-examination STAI-Y 1 scores had a negative correlation with the emotional stability in the BIF-10 questionnaire (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.47, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and a positive correlation with emotional representation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) in IPQ-R. The post-examination STAI-Y 1 had a negative correlation with optimistic orientation (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.59, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001).",
        "The anxiety associated with a WB-MRI examination was only in small part associated with the examination itself, and in fact, most patients preferred WB-MRI to computed tomography. Concern with the outcome of the examination was likely a greater source of anxiety."
