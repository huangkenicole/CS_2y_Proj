        "Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that affects all domains of daily living. Especially, in the case of drug resistance, it is usually associated with impairment of quality of life (QOL). The opportunity to self-express is crucial for maintaining mental health. Therefore, many non-pharmaceutical interventions have been utilized to relieve psychiatric symptoms, such as fear, anxiety, and depression in persons with epilepsy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the occupational therapy program with drama activities (ODTA) on the QOL of patients with epilepsy.",
        "In total, 15 patients with epilepsy from the region of Thrace, Greece, were enrolled in a 3-month OTDA program focusing on the relief of anxiety symptoms and self-regulation. Each patient's QOL was measured using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) mean scores. The reliability change index was calculated and the Wilcoxon paired test was used to determine QOL changes post-intervention compared to pre-intervention.",
        "Statistically significant improvements were observed in fear of having a seizure (p\u202f=.004), overall quality (p\u202f=.001), emotional well-being (p\u202f=.004), energy fatigue (p\u202f=.014), and total QOLIE (p\u202f=.001) score after the intervention. The changes in the QOLIE score were more prominent among female individuals (male vs female: p\u202f=.028 vs p\u202f=.008).",
        "This study highlights the importance of providing an ODTA program in patients with epilepsy and proposes its broader combined application as a complementary intervention in such patients."
