        "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) may be a disorder on the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive disorders, maybe a separate eating disorder, or it may be an eating disorder on the spectrum of other eating disorders. We aimed to explore how anxiety and self-esteem affect the orthorectic tendency among higher-educated groups.",
        "This cross-sectional study was conducted on 248 faculty members selected by stratified sampling method from Ondokuz Mayis University in Samsun, Turkey. Data were collected by face-to-face interview method using Ortho-15, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Beck Anxiety scales.",
        "The study group consisted of 144 (58.1%) males and 104 (41.9%) females, and the mean age was 42.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3\u00a0years. We found a tendency for orthorexia nervosa in 47 (19%) participants. The mean scores were 41.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 for the Ortho-15 scale, 0.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 for the Self-esteem scale, and 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 for the Beck Anxiety Scale. Self-esteem scores were low, and anxiety scores were high in participants who tended to orthorexia (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the high self-esteem scores decrease the orthorectic tendency, while high anxiety scores increase the tendency.",
        "We found a significant relationship between anxiety, low self-esteem and orthorexia nervosa. This result can be considered as a preliminary finding leading to further research. Further clinical and longitudinal studies are needed to determine the characteristics of individuals with orthorexia nervosa and identify the cause and effect relationship with psychiatric comorbidities."
