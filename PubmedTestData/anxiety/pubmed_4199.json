        "Psoriasis is associated with psychological comorbidities. We evaluated the effectiveness of additional psychopharmacotherapy on the clinical severity and associated anxiety and depression in psoriasis. 173 patients were enrolled with psoriasis and associated anxiety and depression. Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and The Beck Depression Scale (BDI) were used to assess anxiety and depression parameters. The IA main group included patients with anxiety disorders who received Mebicar. The IB main group consisted of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders who received Mianserin. The II group comprised patients with anxiety disorders (IIA comparison group) and patients with anxiety and depressive disorders (IIB comparison group), who received only traditional therapy. The level of anxiety in patients of the IA and IB main groups decreased by 2.1 times. The level of depression in the IB main group significantly decreased by 1.7 times, while in the IIB comparison group, this indicator remained almost at the same level. Patients of the IA and IB main groups had PASI50 on average on 15 to 16\u2009days of treatment. PASI50 was achieved in the both comparison groups only at 21 to 22\u2009days. PASI75 occurred in the IA and IIB main groups almost simultaneously on 28 to 29\u2009days of treatment. But in the IIA and IIB comparison groups, these positive changes occurred significantly later than in patients of the main groups (on 34-35\u2009days of treatment). Additional psychopharmacotherapy significantly reduced anxiety and depression in both groups IA and IB, as compared to patients in groups IIA and IIB who received only traditional therapy."
