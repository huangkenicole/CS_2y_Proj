        "Response to an informational-experiential treatment for flight anxiety was compared for 5 internal and 6 external aerophobics. The treatment provided an understanding of the noises and events of a typical commercial flight by relating these to flying an airplane simulator. Locus of control was significantly related to outcome of treatment. Internal subjects reported both more control and less anxiety on an actual post-treatment commercial flight than did external subjects. The results support the contention that understanding is a form of control and that internal persons more effectively utilize control-oriented treatments."
