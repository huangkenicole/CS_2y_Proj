        "The study aimed to determine the relationship between supportive care needs with coronavirus anxiety and death anxiety of women with gynecologic cancer during COVID-19.",
        "The population of the study was women with gynecologic cancer who received chemotherapy in a university hospital. The study sample was calculated using G*Power 3.1.9.4 analysis program and completed with 64 patients who agreed to participate and met the research criteria. The personal information form, supportive care needs survey-short form (SCNS-SF29<sup>Tr</sup> ), coronavirus anxiety scale (CAS), and death anxiety scale (DAS) were used for data collection.",
        "The participants' SCNS-SF29<sup>Tr</sup> mean score was 105.7\u2009\u00b1\u200917.26, CAS mean score was 11.19\u2009\u00b1\u20093.96, and DAS mean score was 40.13\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5. There was a positive, very high-level correlation between the health system and information and psychological needs subscales of SCNS-SF29<sup>Tr</sup> and CAS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.809, r\u00a0=\u00a00.878, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, a high-level relationship was found between the daily life subscale of SCNS-SF29<sup>Tr</sup> and CAS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.674; p\u2009<\u20090.001). A positive low-level relationship was determined between the health system and information, daily life, and psychological needs (except for the sexuality) subscales of SCNS-SF29<sup>Tr</sup> and DAS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.357, r\u00a0=\u00a00.252, r\u00a0=\u00a00.353 respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05).",
        "Gynecologic cancer participants had unmet supportive care needs in all subscales except for the sexuality. The participants had higher supportive care needs, high-level coronavirus anxiety, and medium-level death anxiety. In addition, the participants' all supportive care needs have increased as their coronavirus anxiety levels have increased. The participants' supportive care needs have increased, except for sexuality, as their death anxiety levels have increased."
