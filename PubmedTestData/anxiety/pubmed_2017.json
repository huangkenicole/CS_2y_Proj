        "Growing research indicates that death anxiety is implicated in many mental health conditions. This increasing evidence highlights a need for scalable, accessible and cost-effective psychological interventions to reduce death anxiety.",
        "The present study outlines the results of a phase I trial for one such treatment: <i>Overcome Death Anxiety</i> (ODA). ODA is the first CBT-based online intervention for fears of death, and is an individualised program requiring no therapist guidance.",
        "A sample of 20 individuals with various mental health diagnoses commenced the ODA program. Death anxiety was assessed at baseline and at post-intervention. Depression, anxiety and stress were also measured.",
        "In total, 50% (10/20) reached the end of the program and completed post-treatment questionnaires. Of these, 60% (6/10) showed a clinically reliable reduction in their overall death anxiety, and 90% (9/10) showed a reduction on at least one facet of death anxiety. There were no adverse events noted.",
        "ODA appears to be a safe and potentially effective treatment for death anxiety. The findings have provided initial evidence to support a randomised controlled trial using a larger sample, to further examine the efficacy of ODA."
