        "Individuals with Hoarding Disorder (HD) frequently complain of problems with attention and memory. These self-identified difficulties are often used as justification for saving and acquiring behaviors. Research using neuropsychological measures to examine verbal and visual memory performance and sustained attention have reported contradictory findings. Here we aim to determine the relationship between self-reported problems with memory and attention, objective memory and attention performance, and self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in HD. Data was available for 319 individuals who participated in a treatment study of HD. Multiple regression was used to assess the relationship between self-reported complaints and objective measures, with age, education, and measures of depression and anxiety included as covariates. We found no association between self-reported memory difficulties and objective verbal or visual memory performance. Self-reported problems with attention were associated with objective attentional performance, although this relationship was partially accounted for by anxiety symptom severity. There was a small association between visual memory performance at baseline and improvements in hoardingrelated functional abilities following treatment. Improvements in subjective memory complaints pre-to-post treatment were associated with improvements in hoarding symptom severity and hoarding-related functioning. These results demonstrate a dissociation between perceived and objective functioning in HD."
