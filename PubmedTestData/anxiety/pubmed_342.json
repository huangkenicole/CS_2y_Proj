        "Information about how Thai school-age children perceive fear is necessary for the development of culturally appropriate anxiety or fear measures. The purpose of this study was to describe Thai school-age children's perceptions of fear from their own perspective. Qualitative data from 13 Thai students in Grades 3 to 6 in three schools in Bangkok were obtained by semistructured, formal interviews, combined with drawings. The data were analyzed using content analysis within the frame of category development in the grounded theory method. Several culturally specific aspects of fear were revealed. This information is useful for health care providers caring for Thai children. The results of this study also illustrate the importance of carefully assessing children from culturally diverse backgrounds related to manifestations of anxiety or fear."
