        "<b>Objectives:</b> The perception of being a burden is a well-known risk factor for dying by suicide. Research on factors that precede the state of perceived burdensomeness, such as fearing being a burden, is necessary. We investigated the extent to which health status, elevated depressive symptoms, and elevated anxiety symptoms are associated with fear of being a burden in late life.<b>Method:</b> Older adult participants (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009155) completed the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and demographic and health questions. Fear of being a burden, assessed with a supplemental item on the GAS, was categorically grouped as 'no fear' or 'some fear'. Using logistic regression, we examined predictors of fear of being a burden.<b>Results:</b> In the first step, elevated depression was associated with fear of being a burden (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.09, 4.89, <i>p</i> = .03), but health status was not significant. In the second step, elevated anxiety was significant (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.15, 5.99, <i>p</i> = .02); depression was no longer significant.<b>Conclusion:</b> Contrary to expectations, anxiety more strongly predicted fear of being a burden than depression. Future research should further investigate the role of anxiety in fear of being a burden and ways of intervening."
