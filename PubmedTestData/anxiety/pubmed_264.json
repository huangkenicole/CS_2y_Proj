        "Long surgical waiting times are associated with many negative consequences. Although depression and anxiety have been studied among patients waiting for surgery, fundamental anxieties, such as anxiety sensitivity and health anxiety, have not been examined. Furthermore, research into patients' perspectives on coping while waiting is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of anxiety sensitivity, health anxiety, depression, and anxiety and their influence on coping, concern about waiting, and anxiety about surgery in individuals waiting for surgery. Individuals waiting for surgery completed measures assessing these constructs. Results revealed a high degree of health anxiety and anxiety sensitivity. Regression analysis showed that health anxiety and depression are unique predictors of coping and together help to predict concern about waiting. Anxiety sensitivity and anxiety did not add to the prediction of these variables. Overall, the results suggest that further attention should be given to interventions that address psychological distress during the wait for surgery."
