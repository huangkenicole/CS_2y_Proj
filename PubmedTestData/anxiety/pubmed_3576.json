        "Unrelieved anxiety can produce an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity leading to an increase in cardiac workload. Nursing interventions using music therapy or sensory information among patients with coronary artery disease has resulted in anxiety reduction, though results in Chinese subjects has not previously been published.",
        "To determine the effects of using nursing interventions of music therapy or sensory information, on reducing anxiety and uncertainty, and improving negative mood among Chinese subjects immediately prior to cardiac catheterization.",
        "An experimental three-group repeated measures design for this pilot study was used. Forty-five hospitalized adults (15/group) undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomly assigned to either (1) a music therapy intervention, (2) a sensory information intervention or (3) treatment as usual (control). Anxiety, uncertainty and mood state were measured using self-reported questionnaires and physiological measures were made at baseline, post-intervention to determine their effect and post-cardiac catheterization to determine whether these interventions had any long-lasting effect.",
        "The control group was found to be significantly older (P=0.001) than the two experimental groups. Older age was associated with lower anxiety scores (r=-0.31, P=0.04 at baseline; r=-0.30, P=0.04 post-intervention; r=-0.22, P=0.15 post-cardiac catheterization). After controlling for age, the use of music therapy or sensory information did not significantly reduce anxiety, improve mood state, reduce uncertainty, decrease heart or respiratory rate among subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization.",
        "The non-significant result may have been affected by the small sample, and the social and cultural expectations regarding the public display of emotions among Chinese populations."
