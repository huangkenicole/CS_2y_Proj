        "To explore the feasibility and utility of using a workshop, and supervision-consultation plus external facilitation to disseminate and implement cognitive-behavioral therapy in Veterans Affairs (VA) community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).",
        "This study occurred in the context of a randomized controlled trial aimed at comparing 2 methods for implementing Coordinated Anxiety Learning Management (CALM) in VA CBOCs. A 3-phase (workshop, supervision-consultation, external facilitation) model was used to support 32 VA CBOC mental health providers in learning and adopting CALM in their clinical practice. Qualitative data describe training activities and the feasibility and utility of each training phase in addressing challenges to adopting CALM.",
        "All 3 phases of the model were feasible to use with our sample of CBOC mental health providers. Providers reported challenges learning CALM during the workshop and concerns about not having enough training post-workshop to use CALM in practice. Providers primarily utilized supervision-consultation to tailor CALM to their practice, including learning how to prioritize a target disorder, \"switch\" the focus of treatment to a different disorder when comorbidities were present, and modify CALM sessions to fit shorter treatment visits. Providers primarily utilized external facilitation to further tailor CALM to their practice through implementation (eg, concrete help) and support-oriented help. Key lessons for implementing CALM in CBOCs are presented and discussed.",
        "Findings provide initial evidence for the feasibility and utility of using each component of a facilitation-enhanced training model to promote CBOC VA providers' implementation of a computer and manual version of CALM in their practice."
