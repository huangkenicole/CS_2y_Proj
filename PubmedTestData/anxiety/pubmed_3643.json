        "Attentional control has an important role in attentional bias in social anxiety. This study aimed to investigate whether attentional bias in social anxiety was caused by attentional control deficit. Event-related potentials and behavioural attentional bias index (trial-level attentional bias variability) were recorded as participants completed the dot-probe task. The behaviour result showed that compared with the low socially anxious individuals, the high socially anxious individuals had a marginally higher score of attentional bias variability. For event-related potentials results, target-locked frontocentral N2 amplitude was significantly larger under the incongruent condition than the congruent condition in the low socially anxious group, whereas there was no significant difference between these two conditions in the high socially anxious group. The low socially anxious group also exhibited reduced target-locked P2 amplitude from the congruent condition to the incongruent condition. Our findings provide electrophysiological evidence of attentional control dysregulation in socially anxious individuals, which contributes to modifying social anxiety-related attentional bias."
