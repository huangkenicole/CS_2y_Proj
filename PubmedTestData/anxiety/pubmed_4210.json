        "Pregnancy loss has negative impacts on both the physical and the mental health of expectant mothers, which calls for an in-depth investigation. In this study, we examined the effects of case management on patients with pregnancy loss after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET).",
        "100 participants that had suffered pregnancy loss after IVF-ET-assisted pregnancy from January 2019 to March 2020 were divided into routine care and case management groups, each with 50 cases. For the routine care group, a doctor led the diagnostic and treatment processes and a nurse assisted with the treatment. For the case management group, a nurse led the patient diagnostic and treatment processes and a doctor controlled the diagnosis and treatment plan formulation. Case management models were established according to the comprehensive peripregnancy loss care of patients with pregnancy loss after IVF-ET-assisted pregnancy. The participants' outcomes (satisfaction, anxiety, and depression) were assessed at the time of pregnancy loss and 1 and 3 months after pregnancy loss during follow-up of the routine care and case management groups.",
        "There was no statistical difference between the patients in the two groups with regard to their general information statistics (<i>P</i> > 0.05) or their satisfaction, anxiety, and depression at the time of pregnancy loss (<i>P</i> > 0.05). One month after pregnancy loss, there was no statistical difference in anxiety between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05), but satisfaction was greater and depression was significantly reduced in the case management group compared with the routine care group (<i>P</i> < 0.05).",
        "Case management care can have a positive effect on improving the satisfaction, anxiety, and depression of patients that have had pregnancy loss after IVF-ET."
