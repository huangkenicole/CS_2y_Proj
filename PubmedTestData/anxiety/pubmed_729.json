        "Preoperative anxiety has a significant effect on the outcome of anesthesia and surgery. At present, there is no published data on the preoperative anxiety levels in Sri Lankan patients. In the West, several validated questionnaires such as The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) are used. To measure the preoperative anxiety levels in patients using APAIS and to analyze the factors affecting anxiety and the role played by the anesthetist in allaying anxiety.",
        "One hundred patients scheduled for elective surgery were prospectively studied using the APAIS. The internal consistency was checked using Cronbach's alpha.",
        "The ages varied 25 to 72 years (mean=48.7 years, SD=13.6). Reliability of the APAIS was high; Cronbach's alpha=0.864 in the overall component and 0.84, 0.73 and 0.97 in the anxiety related to surgery, anesthesia and in the information desire components, respectively. Females were more anxious than males (p=0.02) and those who had never sustained surgery were more anxious than those who previously had surgery (p=0.05). An anesthetist's visit and premedication reduced total anxiety scores (Z=-3.07, p=0.002) and anesthesia related anxiety scores (Z=-3.45, p=0.001).",
        "The prevalence of anxiety is high among Sri Lankan patients. Females are more anxious than males and those who have never had surgery are more anxious than those who have had surgery. The anesthetist's visit could reduce anxiety. Sinhala version of the APAIS is highly reliable in assessing the preoperative anxiety levels."
