        "COVID-19 has affected individuals of all age groups, both physically and mentally. We aimed to determine anxiety and depression in children diagnosed with COVID-19. Fifty children aged 8 to 18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The children were evaluated the revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, STAI form TX-I (state anxiety inventory), and STAI form TX-II (trait anxiety inventory). Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire was applied for one of the parents according to three different periods. The periods were established as before the pandemic, during the illness-quarantine process, and after the quarantine. We observed the highest scores for depression-anxiety and the poorest sleep quality during the quarantine period. The scores for depression-anxiety were lower, and sleep quality scores were higher in the prepandemic period compared with after the quarantine period. Measures should be taken to protect mental health for children with COVID-19."
