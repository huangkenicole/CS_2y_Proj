        "To investigate the effect of parental presence and the distraction of the attention by a toy in children undergoing a painful procedure.",
        "A randomised study with two experimental groups and one control group-130 children (64 girls and 66 boys), mean age 8.3 years (range 7-10 years) were randomly assigned to one of the three groups from September 2006 to March 2007: the parent presence group, the toy group, the control group. The verbal rating scale of pain, the assessment of vital signs before and after the procedure and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were used.",
        "Children who had their parent close to them showed a reduction in breaths (95% confidence interval (CI) for gradient of regression line): -4.20 to -2.80, p<0.001), mean blood pressure (95% CI: -4.88 to -2.99, p<0.001) and pulse (95% CI: -8.76 to -5.68, p<0.001) compared to the children whose parents were absent. They also felt less pain (95% CI: -4.40 to -2.71, p<0.001) and they were less distressed (95% confidence interval for A-State tool (CIA-State): -10.46 to -6.49, p<0.001 and 95% confidence interval for A-Trait tool (CIA-Trait): -5.71 to -2.13, p<0.001).",
