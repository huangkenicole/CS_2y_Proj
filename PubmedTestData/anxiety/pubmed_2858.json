        "<b>Objective:</b> To understand the association between pregnancy intention and pregnancy-related anxiety in the second and third trimester and its strength. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective cohort study was conducted in Ma'anshan, Anhui province. A total of 3 474 eligible pregnant women within 14 weeks of gestation were recruited. The information about their demographic characteristics were collected in early pregnancy. The completed questionnaire of pregnancy-related anxiety were asked to return in the second and third trimester. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between pregnancy intention and pregnancy-related anxiety in the second and third trimester. <b>Results:</b> A total of 3 083 pregnant women were included in final analysis, The rate of unintentional pregnancy was 15.00<i>%</i> (<i>n</i>=461). The detection rates of pregnancy-related anxiety in the second and third trimester were 29.13<i>%</i> (<i>n</i>=898) and 30.36<i>%</i> (<i>n</i>=936). After controlling potential confounding factors, unintentional pregnancy increased the risk of pregnancy-related anxiety in the second trimester compared with intentional pregnancy (<i>OR</i>=1.85, 95<i>%CI</i>: 1.44-2.38); The risk of pregnancy-related anxiety also increased in the third trimester (<i>OR</i>=1.84, 95<i>%CI</i>: 1.44-2.35). Intentional pregnancy did not increase the risk of pregnancy-related anxiety in the second and third trimester. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study results suggests that unintentional pregnancy could increase the risk of pregnancy-related anxiety in the second and third trimester."
