        "During the postpartum period, mothers are particularly vulnerable to a number of distinct changes that are generally perceived as distressing and stressful. Although such stressors are common, some mothers may experience significant anxiety as a result of these stressors. Validating international tools to evaluate postpartum anxiety among Palestinian women is crucial, as women living in this context experience several stressors and life challenges due to the political conflict. The PSAS can be a useful measure to assess anxiety level among mothers during the postpartum months; which enable mental health providers to provide psychological interventions for mothers whose anxiety levels are high."

        "The Postpartum-Specific Anxiety Scale (PSAS) is an international measure designed to evaluate anxiety experienced by mothers in the postpartum period from one day to six months; the scale was translated into Arabic and validated within Palestinian context to test postpartum anxiety among Palestinian women.",
        "The current study aimed to test the psychometric properties and the factorial structure within the Arabic language in a Palestinian context using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The sample of this study consisted of 475 Palestinian women recruited from health centers in the West Banks of Palestine using a convenience sample. 61% were of ages 20-30 years and 39% percent ages 31-40 years.",
        "The PSAS showed good validity and reliability indicators in assessing postpartum anxiety within Palestinian context. Results of CFA showed a stable construct of a four-factor structure in assessing postpartum anxiety among Palestinian mothers: (1) competence and attachment anxieties, (2) infant safety and welfare anxieties, (3) practical baby care anxieties and (4) psychosocial adjustment to motherhood, which is consisting with the original four-factor structure of the scale.",
        "The PSAS showed good validity indicators within Palestinian context. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct similar studies with clinical and non-clinical groups in the Palestinian society. The PSAS can be a useful measure to assess anxiety levels among women during the postpartum months; which will enable mental health providers to provide psychological interventions for mothers whose anxiety levels are high."
