        "To investigate the effect of virtual reality (VR) on anxiety, stress, and hemodynamic parameters during cesarean section (CS).",
        "This is a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the operating theatre / Maternal and Children Hospital, Najran, Saudi Arabia from February to October 2021. The study comprised a random sample of 351(176 study and 175 control) low-risk pregnant women undergoing elective CS with regional anesthesia. Data collection was carried out using 5 instruments. Basic and clinical data sheet, maternal hemodynamic parameters assessment sheet, brief measure of preoperative emotional stress, a novel visual facial anxiety scale, and maternal satisfaction scale. Virtual reality group exposed to 3D natural videos associated with calm Quran or music voices via phone using VR glasses immediately after anesthesia until completion of skin suture. The control group left for routine hospital care.",
        "The VR group showed significantly lower stress and anxiety levels immediately after skin suture and 2h postoperative (<i>p</i>=0.000). Maternal satisfaction 2 hours after CS showed that 58% of the VR group were completely satisfied compared to 11.3% of the control group (FET=135.359 <i>p</i>=0.000). Virtual reality have an impact on hemodynamic parameters at some time points while peripheral oxygen saturation did not differ significantly (<i>p</i>>0.05).",
        "Virtual reality significantly reduced anxiety and stress among women undergoing CS under regional anesthesia. Virtual reality may be added to the routine intraoperative techniques that help induce patient relaxation and increase satisfaction."
