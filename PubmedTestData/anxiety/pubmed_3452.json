      "AbstractText": [
        "The process of adaptation of the woman to pregnancy seems to be influenced by many factors, such as the type of conception, the mother's age, the possible presence of other children, and socio-cultural factors. Women who conceived with an assisted reproductive technique are emotionally vulnerable; compared with pregnant women who procreated naturally, they manifest elevated anxiety, which seems to be correlated to the fright of being separated from their child. Objectives of the present research are as follows: (1) to analyze the relationship between age, gestational age, time expectancy, previous failed attempts, perception of a high-risk pregnancy, and presence of other children, with the level of maternal-fetal attachment (MFA); (2) explore the level of maternal-infant attachment and anxiety by comparing the control and experimental group; (3) to measure a possible relationship between anxiety levels and MFA in ART pregnant women; (4) to identify variables predictive of prenatal attachment. The study group is formed by ninety-five women aged between 18-42 years (M = 30.57; S.D. = 5.47), pregnant from the 23rd to the 37th week (M = 28.95; S.D. = 3.99); on which 50 women who procreate naturally and 45 pregnant women following assisted reproductive technology. They completed: Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and ad hoc questionnaire to collect anamnestic data. The results show the presence of a correlation between gestational age and waiting period, between the number of assisted fertilization attempts with the worry about their ability to become pregnant, but a negative correlation between pregnancy weeks and the level of maternal-fetal attachment. The study shows the predictive role of anxiety on the MFA. The applications and indications for future research are analyzed."
