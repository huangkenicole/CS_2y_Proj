        "Not many physicians would argue with the opinion that therapeutic success depends significantly on the psychic condition of the patient. It is generally accepted that a patient who strongly believes in recovery will respond better to therapy than a patient who is no longer ready to deal with difficulties caused by the disease. The patient needs to be the subject and the co-creator of the mobilization process rather than the object passively awaiting help from outside. Sometimes the patient is able to draw healing forces from the psyche. More often, the patient is unable to do so and therefore needs psychological care from another person. The task of this person is to extract and awaken forces that are latent in the patient or even to lend the patient the desire to live. The aim of this study was to review reports on the dynamics of hope in neoplastic disease and ways of stimulating hope.",
        "Hope is present in patients with cancer in the form of a psychic defensive mechanism, a source of actions aimed at coping with difficulties associated with therapy and progress of the disease, and as energy liberating the courage to conquer limitations caused by the disease. Psychological aid should not only be directed at reducing anxiety but also at supporting the development of hope."
