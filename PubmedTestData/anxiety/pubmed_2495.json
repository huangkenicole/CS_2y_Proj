        "The perinatal period has been well-established as a time of vulnerability to anxiety, as has the COVID-19 pandemic. Perinatal women with a prior diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) may be anticipated to be at particular risk for elevated symptom burden when facing the overlay of these stressors. This study examined whether pre-existing anxiety exacerbates COVID-19-related health worries on anxiety symptom severity among a sample of women who entered perinatal status during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed COVID-19-related health worries, past diagnosis of GAD, and current generalized anxiety symptoms cross-sectionally in 1,587 perinatal U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21, 2020 to June 24, 2021). Among perinatal women who reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries, those with a pre-existing GAD diagnosis were 3.56 times more likely to score at clinically significant levels of generalized anxiety, while those without a pre-existing GAD diagnosis were 6.51 times more likely. COVID-19-related health worries posed a larger risk for elevated anxiety symptoms among those without a pre-existing diagnosis of GAD. Greater access to treatment and psychoeducation for such individuals may be warranted for individuals without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis."
