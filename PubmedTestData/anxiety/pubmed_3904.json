        "Patients often search for health-related information on the internet allthough this trend may have some benefits, it also has some risks, such as misinformation. The aim of this study is to evaluate how Internet information seeking affect the level of anxiety in patients with endometriosis.",
        "This prospective observational study was conducted at our outpatient clinic between March 2019 and December 2020. We enrolled We enrolled all patients with a confirmed sonographic diagnosis of endometriosis who had sought information about the disease prior to our visit. We divided them into two groups based on the source of information (Internet only vs multiple sources). Before the visit, we asked women to fill-in validated questionnaires about anxiety, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD) and the Spielberg State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI- Y6) and the Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP) - 5. After the visit, the STAI-Y6 was resubmitted to each woman.",
        "We enrolled 200 women who filled-in the questionnaires: 46 reported the Internet as the only source of information, 52 sought information also from medically qualified sources, 74 consulted only healthcare professionals, and 28 resorted to medical journals. Women who used the Internet as their exclusive source of information were younger on average and their STAI-Y6 score after the visit was significantly lower compared to other group (34.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.5 vs 42.1\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7, <i>p</i> = .001). Moreover, the difference between the STAI-Y6 scores before and after our assessment was higher in these women (-18.3\u2009\u00b1\u200914.7 vs -10.3\u2009\u00b1\u200916.5, <i>p</i> = .003).",
        "Women who sought information online were younger, had lower levels of state trait anxiety after our medical evaluation, and a had a greater reduction in anxiety levels after our examination compared to women who consulted other sources to learn more about endometriosis.KEY MESSAGESWomen using only Internet are younger than those who use other sources of information.Women who researched symptoms online showed higher pre-examination anxiety levels.Patients with severe pain symptoms consulted both the internet and professionals."
