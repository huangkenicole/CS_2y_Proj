        "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States and result in substantial burden to the individual and society. Although effective treatments for anxiety disorders have been developed, there has been substantially less focus on interventions aimed at the amelioration of anxiety-related risk and maintenance factors. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established, malleable risk and maintenance factor for panic disorder and other psychopathology. The aim of the current investigation was to enhance the efficacy of AS treatment through the refinement of a previously validated intervention.",
        "This 1-session intervention utilized psychoeducation and interoceptive exposure to target AS and was compared with a health-focused control intervention among a nontreatment seeking sample (N = 104) of individuals with elevated AS.",
        "Study findings indicate that the active treatment group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in AS than the control group at posttreatment and across the 1-month study period. These treatment gains were seen across the ASI subscales. A Month 6 follow-up assessment indicated that the treatment group retained the majority of their AS reduction, whereas the control group retained their elevated AS scores. The intervention responses of participants meeting Axis I diagnostic criteria did not differ from the responses of those without a current diagnosis.",
        "Despite the brevity of the treatment intervention, findings demonstrate that it resulted in substantial reductions in AS that were largely maintained 6 months posttreatment. Anxiety treatment and prevention implications are discussed."
