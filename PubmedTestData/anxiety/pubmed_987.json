        "Anxiety before an invasive intervention is associated in children with persistent psychological disorders. We studied the effect of the transfer to the catheterisation room by an electric toy car on the anxiety of children and their parents before a cardiac catheterisation.",
        "Forty-eight children with a median age of 5.6 years [4.2-7.0] were randomised to either riding on an electric car to go to the catheterisation laboratory or being transported lying supine on a gurney. Anxiety assessments were performed by a physician blinded to group allocation on the day before the procedure (T0) and at anaesthesia induction (T1). The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Short Form (mYPAS-SF) and visual analogue scale for anxiety (VAS-A) were used in the children and the VAS-A in the parents.",
        "The mYPAS-SF, VAS-A-child, and the VAS-A-parent scores were significantly higher at T1 than at T0 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005, respectively). The primary outcome (the median mYPAS-SF score at T1) was not significantly different in the two groups when males and females were combined. At T1, the VAS-A-child score, however, was significantly lower in the intervention than the control group (22 versus 55, p < 0.001). In the boys, the median mYPAS-SF score at T1 was significantly lower in the intervention group (25.0 versus 51.0, p = 0.024). No difference was observed in girls. The VAS-A parent score was lower at T1 in the intervention group (60 versus 87, p = 0.05).",
        "Riding to the catheterisation laboratory on an electric toy car decreased anxiety in boys and decreased parental anxiety."
