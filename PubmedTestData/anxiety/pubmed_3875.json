        "Anxiety levels in medical students have been reported as higher than the aged-matched general population, yet medical students are less likely to seek care for mental health issues. Medical students carry high levels of self-stigma about their own mental health and fear the negative consequences of seeking care. The purpose of this study was to examine the student population at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville (UofSC SOMG) for anxiety levels and determine the self-stigma attitudes this population carries. UofSC SOMG students were surveyed using the GAD7, questions about mental health stigma, and open-ended questions on barriers to mental health care in medical students. Anxiety levels were compared to student responses. 31% of students reported moderate-severe anxiety levels. Stigma was the most frequently listed barrier to care, however, students with moderate-severe anxiety were more likely to report cost as a barrier to care than students with minimal anxiety levels. Despite free and accessible mental health care, medical students at UofSC SOMG still have anxiety at rates higher than the general population. Future work should help to provide interventions to the barriers of care, so medical students can better utilize mental health care resources."
