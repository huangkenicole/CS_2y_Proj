        "The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of observational studies evaluating anxiety and depression in patients with uveitis.",
        "A higher prevalence of depression was reported in patients with uveitis compared to healthy controls in most observational studies. Symptoms of anxiety were often, but not always, significantly worse in patients with uveitis compared to controls. Most studies found that patients with uveitis had reduced vision-related quality of life that was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms.",
        "Patients with uveitis have a higher risk of experiencing symptoms of depression and could benefit from screening and treatment. Preliminary screening for vision-related quality of life could also help determine if the patient requires assistance in mental health or other aspects of daily living."
