      "AbstractText": [
        "In December 2019, a series of acute, atypical respiratory diseases was identified in Wuhan, China. The source of the illnesses was attributed to a novel coronavirus, named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent disease it causes was named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.",
        "According to the retrieval strategies, randomized controlled trials on auricular points for anxiety in patients with coronavirus 2019 will be obtained from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, regardless of publication date or language. Studies will be screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the literature. The network meta-analysis will be performed with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and carried out with Stata 14.2 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software. Ultimately, the quality of the evidence obtained from the results will be evaluated.",
        "This study will evaluate whether auricular points can effectively treat anxiety in patients with COVID-19.",
        "This study will provide evidence for whether auricular points is beneficial to the treatment of anxiety in patients with COVID-19.",
