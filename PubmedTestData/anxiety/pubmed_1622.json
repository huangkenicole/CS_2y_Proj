        "The objective of this review is to shed light on the literature regarding the psychological impact of invasive cosmetic surgery and to discuss future implications for research and clinical practice. Articles published through October 2021 were reviewed to answer the question, \"Does cosmetic surgery improve a patient's overall psychological health?\" Psychological well-being was examined through the lens of body image, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression scores. The studies revealed that although cosmetic surgery seems to boost patients' body image, other crucial aspects of psychological well-being may or may not similarly benefit. Notably, factors such as a patient's preoperative mental status, level of education, type of cosmetic procedure, postoperative healing time, sex, and age play a role in determining the direction and magnitude of psychological change after surgery. Limitations include the lack of diversity in study populations and the potential role of body dysmorphic disorder. Overall, researchers have concluded that cosmetic surgery improves body image but remain in disagreement on its effects on self-esteem, anxiety, and depression."
