        "Teaching in English (aka English as a medium of instruction [EMI]) presents a significant challenge for many university instructors. This is particularly true for those who have never taught an EMI course before, as they may feel confused, anxious, and unsure how to start. Beyond the challenge of the language itself, the pressure of conveying specialized knowledge in a non-native language and ensuring student comprehension are major sources of stress. This article was developed to share and explore the approach and experience of a field instructor teaching his first EMI course in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). In the article, the anxieties and worries that may arise prior to starting the course and strategies that may be used to overcome these are discussed. In addition, measures that teachers may use to effectively manage classes and ensure student understanding during the course and to continually enhance teaching quality are addressed. We hope this article can help those interested in or required to teach EMI courses successfully take the first step and continue to improve with confidence, enhancing their teaching abilities."
