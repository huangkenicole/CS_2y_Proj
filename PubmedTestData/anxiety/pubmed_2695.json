        "Having analyzed the sources devoted to the problem of the influence of the educational load on the peculiarities of the mental status of students, it is necessary to highlight the importance and prospects of this scientific direction. The article deals with the peculiarities of the mental condition of the instructed youth of educational institutions of various types, analyzes psycho-hygienic aspects of mental fatigue, and assesses the age-related dynamics of the mental state of students. Special attention is paid to the study of mental and somatic status of students with maximum stressful tension during the examination session. Consequently, the studied scientific sources demonstrate the peculiarities of mental work of students, which allow us to regard it as a special kind of activity, characterized by the presence of unfavorable social and psychological factors, the combined effect of which can lead to a decrease in the level of mental and somatic health and the development of subclinical and clinical mental disorders."
