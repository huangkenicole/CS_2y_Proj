        "Anxiety disorders and symptoms are common in people with psychotic disorders, having a negative impact on clinical status, function level and overall prognosis. However, research on the significance of anxiety in predicting remission and long-term functioning in first-episode psychosis (FEP) is still scarce. This study investigated the effects of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) on clinical and functional improvement in individuals with FEP.",
        "FEP patients (N = 97) aged 18-40\u2009years were recruited from the University Hospital District of Helsinki and the City of Helsinki. Psychotic and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed using the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI-R), and functioning was evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Follow-up measurements were performed at 2 and 12\u2009months. We specifically studied whether anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms at the 2-month follow-up assessment, at a time when the initial treatment response had been achieved, would predict outcomes at 12\u2009months.",
        "Symptoms of anxiety and OCS correlated moderately with each other and psychotic symptoms, but at the 12-month follow-up, OCS no longer correlated significantly with psychotic and anxiety symptoms. When the level of psychotic symptoms was adjusted for, more severe OCS at the 2-month follow-up was associated with a lower rate of remission at 12\u2009months, whereas a higher level of anxiety symptoms at 2 months was associated with better functioning at 12\u2009months.",
        "OCS may be predictive of poorer clinical outcomes, whereas anxiety symptoms may predict better functional outcomes."
