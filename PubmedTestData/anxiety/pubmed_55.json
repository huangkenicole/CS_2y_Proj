        "Postpartum anxiety has negative consequences for both mother and infant, so effective identification and measurement is vital to enable intervention. Despite NICE recommendations to prioritise the measurement of postpartum anxiety in mothers, current clinical measurement in England remains both fragmented and flawed. The Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale [PSAS] offers an alternative, as it measures maternal-focused anxieties which can enable specifically targeted interventions. However, it is only currently used as a research tool and may require modification for clinical use. To inform modification of the PSAS, nineteen stakeholders from a variety of organisations participated in a two-round Delphi consensus survey to measure its clinical relevance and potential for effective identification of clinical anxiety. Descriptive analyses revealed all subscales of the PSAS scored highly across all domains, excluding Practical Infant Care Anxieties. Analyses also indicated good consensus between stakeholders across specific items, suggesting that the some items on the PSAS are relevant and effective at identifying clinical postpartum anxiety. Participants also expressed a need for a shorter version of the PSAS for clinical use, and that additional items may need including. Future research must now adapt the existing PSAS based on the results of this study and pilot the adapted measure in a clinical population."
