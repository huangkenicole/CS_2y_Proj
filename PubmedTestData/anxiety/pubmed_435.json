        "The authors compared levels and types of fears and anxieties in a sample of Mexican American children and adolescents with disabilities to a group of White children and adolescents with similar disabilities. Students (N = 238), parents, and teachers completed the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (T. H. Ollendick, 1983) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (C. R. Reynolds & B. O. Richmond, 1997). Levels of fear and anxiety were similar for both groups of students and were similarly underestimated by teachers. The groups of students differed in terms of their specific fears and the degree to which their parents recognized their children's fears (Mexican American parents were less accurate at rating their children's fears). Mexican American girls aged 7-10 and 11-13 years and White girls aged 14-18 years reported the highest scores; White boys aged 14-18 years reported the lowest scores."
