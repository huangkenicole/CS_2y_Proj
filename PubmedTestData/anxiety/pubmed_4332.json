      "AbstractText": [
        "The study shows preliminary results of \u201cThe ACTyourCHANGE in Teens\u201d project, a Randomized Controlled Trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-based intervention combined with treatment as usual (ACT+TAU) compared to TAU only, for improving psychological well-being, psychological distress, experiential avoidance and fusion, emotion dysregulation, and emotional eating in a sample of 34 in-patient adolescents with obesity (Body Mass Index > 97th centile). Mixed between-within 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures analyses of variances (ANOVAs) were carried out to examine the changes in psychological conditions of participants over time. Moderation analyses were also conducted to test whether pre-test anxiety, depression, stress, and experiential avoidance and fusion predicted emotional eating at post-test with groups (ACT+TAU vs. TAU only) as moderators. Only a significant interaction effect (time \u00d7 group) from pre- to post-test (p = 0.031) and a significant main effect of time on anxiety (p < 0.001) and emotional eating (p = 0.010) were found. Only in the TAU only group were higher levels of depression (p = 0.0011), stress (p = 0.0012), and experiential avoidance and fusion (p = 0.0282) at pre-test significantly associated with higher emotional eating at post-test. Although future replication and improvements of the study may allow us to obtain more consistent results, this preliminary evidence is actually promising."
