        "Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse can cause severe anxiety disorder and interfere with gut homeostasis. Obeticholic acid (OCA) has emerged as a protective agent against diet-related anxiety that improves gut homeostasis. The potential for OCA to ameliorate Meth-induced anxiety, and the microbial mechanisms involved, remain obscure. Here, C57/BL6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with Meth (15\u00a0mg/kg) to induce anxiety-like behavior. 16\u00a0S rRNA sequence analysis and fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) were used to profile the gut microbiome and evaluate its effects, respectively. Orally administered OCA was investigated for protection against Meth-induced anxiety. Results indicated that Meth mediated anxiety-like behavior, aroused hippocampal neuroinflammation through activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway, weakened intestinal barrier and disturbed the gut microbiome. Specifically, abundance of anxiety-related Rikenella was increased. FMT from Meth-administrated mice also weakened intestinal barrier and elevated serum LPS, inducing hippocampal neuroinflammation and anxiety-like behavior in recipient mice. Finally, OCA pretreatment ameliorated Meth-induced impairment of gut homeostasis by reshaping the microbial composition and improving the intestinal barrier. Meth-induced anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal neuroinflammation were also ameliorated by OCA pretreatment. These preliminary findings reveal the crucial role of gut microbiota in Meth-induced anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation, highlighting OCA as a potential candidate for the prevention of Meth-induced anxiety."
