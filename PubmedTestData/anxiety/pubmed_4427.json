        "The present paper reports the results of a study investigating the relationship between a domains-independent measure of disgust (the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised) and measures of eating disorder symptomatology in a non-clinical population. Significant correlations between disgust sensitivity and disgust propensity and selected eating disorder symptomatology measures suggested that disgust is significantly correlated with measures of eating disorder symptomatology and is appraised more negatively. However, both measures of disgust propensity and sensitivity failed to predict any significant residual variance in scores on eating symptomatology measures when either trait anxiety or anxiety sensitivity was controlled for. This suggests that while the experience of disgust may be heightened in individuals with eating disorders, it may be linked to other relevant emotions such as anxiety and anxiety sensitivity rather than being an independent risk factor for symptoms."
