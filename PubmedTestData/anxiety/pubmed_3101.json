        "Functional neurological disorder (FND) may commonly co-occur with persistent symptoms following a psychological trauma or physical injury such as concussion.",
        "To explore the occurrence of FND in a population with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) and the associations between FND and depression as well as anxiety in participants with PPCS.",
        "Sixty-three individuals with PPCS presenting to a specialized brain injury clinic completed the following questionnaires: screening for somatoform disorder conversion disorder subscale (SOM-CD), Rivermead post-concussion symptom questionnaire (RPQ), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire- 7 (GAD-7). Both multiple linear regression and logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the relationship between questionnaires and adjust for covariates.",
        "We found that total RPQ score (\u03b2\u02c6=\u200a0.27; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a[0.16, 0.38]), GAD-7 score (\u03b2\u02c6=\u200a0.71; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a[0.50, 0.92]) and PHQ-9 score (\u03b2\u02c6=\u200a0.54; 95% CI\u200a=\u200a[0.32, 0.76]) were positively associated with SOM-CD score individually, after consideration of other covariates. Participants meeting the criteria for severe FND symptoms were 4.87 times more likely to have high PPCS symptom burden (95% CI\u200a=\u200a[1.57, 22.84]), 8.95 times more likely to have severe anxiety (95% CI\u200a=\u200a[3.31, 35.03]) and 4.11 times more likely to have severe depression symptom burden (95% CI\u200a=\u200a[1.77, 11.53]).",
        "The findings of this study indicate an association between FND and post-concussion symptoms as well as an association between FND and symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with PPCS. Patients with PPCS should be screened for FND to provide a more targeted treatment approach that includes somatic-focused interventions."
