        "Metabolic disorders can induce psychiatric comorbidities. Both brain and neuronal composition imbalances reportedly induce an anxiety-like phenotype. We hypothesized that alterations of localized brain areas and cholecystokinin (CCK) and parvalbumin (PV) expression could induce anxiety-like behavior in type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats. Twenty-week-old OLETF and non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were used. The areas of corticolimbic regions were smaller in OLETF rats. The densities of CCK\u00a0positive neurons in the lateral and basolateral amygdala, hippocampal cornu ammonis area 2, and prelimbic cortex were higher in OLETF rats. The densities of PV\u00a0positive neurons were comparable between OLETF and LETO rats. Locomotion in the center zone in the open field test was lower in OLETF rats. These results suggest that imbalances of specific brain region areas and neuronal compositions in emotion-related areas increase the prevalence of anxiety-like behaviors in OLETF rats."
