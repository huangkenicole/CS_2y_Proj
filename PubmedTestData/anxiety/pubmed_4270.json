      "AbstractText": [
        "Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is common and burdensome to patients, but often remains undetected. Oncology professionals report need for tools to improve FCR detection in routine care. Oncology care guidelines recommend the Distress Thermometer (DT) for distress screening, but it has not been validated for FCR. This study evaluated the capacity of the DT and accompanying problem list to detect FCR.",
        "Amalgamated data of two studies with 149 breast cancer and 74 colorectal cancer survivors were used. We evaluated the Dutch DT including the DT score, problem list fears item and emotional domain score using Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses. The Dutch Cancer Worry Scale-6 (CWS-6) was used as reference measure, with validated cut-off scores \u226510 and \u226512 for high FCR. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were calculated.",
        "The DT score showed poor performance in discriminating between low and high FCR. The recommended cut-off \u22654 had low sensitivity (65% for CWS-6\u226510; 72% for CWS-6 \u226512) and specificity (67% and 58%). No other cut-off had an acceptable combination of sensitivity and specificity. The fears item had low sensitivity (29% and 44.9%) and high specificity (95% and 94%). The emotional domain score had fair performance in discriminating between low and high FCR but there was no cut-off with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.",
        "The DT as currently recommended in oncology care guidelines is not suitable to effectively detect FCR in routine care. To improve patients access to psychosocial care, it should be investigated how FCR-specific measures can be integrated in oncology practice."
