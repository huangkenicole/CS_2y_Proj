        "The aim of this study is to evaluate psychiatric symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and investigate the relationship of traumatic life events with the disease.",
        "Fifty-four patients and fifty healthy controls were included in this study. Psychiatric symptoms were measured with the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and sociodemographic information form were used. All scales were applied to both IBS cases and healthy control groups.",
        "Somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anger hostility, additional items and total scores of SCL-90-R were higher in the IBS group compared to the control group. Trait anxiety was significantly higher in the IBS group and state anxiety, significantly higher in the control group. In those with a personal history of traumatic events, all subscales and total scores of SCL-90-R were increased significantly. Scores of psychiatric scales, which indicate stressful life events, were significantly higher before the onset of abdominal pain.",
        "Environmental factors that cause considerable emotional distress, such as chronic stress, trauma, and abuse, have been linked to IBS and the severity of symptoms. Therefore, it is important to consider the psychiatric symptoms in the management of IBS."
