        "Anxiety and health-promoting behavior.",
        "No significant differences were found in anxiety levels. A significant difference was found between the two groups in overall Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) scores. Women in the low-risk group scored higher on all HPLP subscales, with significant differences on self-actualization and health responsibility.",
        "Findings support the need for nurses to assess high-risk pregnant women for their health practices during pregnancy. Although a major focus on nursing care during pregnancy is teaching the promotion of health, only limited research exists on the effectiveness of such interventions."
