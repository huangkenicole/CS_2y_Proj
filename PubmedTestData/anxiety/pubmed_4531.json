        "To determine the anxiety and stress levels of women with suspected endometrial cancer and factors affecting this.",
        "Prospective survey and paired observational study of consecutive women with suspected endometrial cancer in a rapid access gynaecology clinic. Structured questionnaire including a GAD-7 anxiety test and a modified stress thermometer were used. Patients ranked their perception of a cancer diagnosis on 0-5 Likert scale (0\u00a0=\u00a0confident not cancer and 5\u00a0=\u00a0cancer). Patients requiring an endometrial tissue biopsy were asked to rank their pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS), this was paired with the survey results.",
        "250 patients completed the study and 23 of which underwent an endometrial tissue biopsy. The median age was 50-59 years old and 59% of women spoke English as their first language. 32% of patients had significant levels of anxiety with GAD-7 score \u226510. The median stress score was three out of five on Likert scale. GAD-7 anxiety scores were higher in women who perceived that they received insufficient information prior to clinic (sufficient information 5 vs. insufficient information 9.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.00036) or had a disability (disability 9 vs. no disability 5.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.00374). The median VAS score from the biopsies was seven out of 10 (range 1-10). Patients with higher anxiety levels (GAD-7 scores) were more likely to believe they had cancer P <0.00001.",
        "These findings confirm high levels of anxiety and stress in women with suspected endometrial cancer. Adequate pre-clinic information is essential, particularly for minority groups."
