        "Dextromethorphan (DXM) is an effective over-the-counter antitussive with an alarming increase as an abused drug for recreational purposes. Although reports of the association between DXM administration and anxiety, there are few investigations into the underlying DMX mechanisms of anxiogenic action. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) in DXM-induced anxiety/exploratory-related behaviors in adult male Wistar rats. Animals were bilaterally cannulated in the MD regions. After one week, anxiety and exploratory behaviors were measured using an elevated plus-maze task (EPM) and a hole-board apparatus. Results showed that DXM (3-7\u00a0mg/kg, i. p.) dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behaviors. Intra-MD administration of ACPA (2.5-10 ng/rat), a selective CB1 receptor agonist, decreased anxiety-like effects of DXM. The blockade of MD CB1 receptors by AM-251 (40-120 ng/rat) did not affect the EPM task. However, it potentiated the anxiogenic response of an ineffective dose of DXM (3\u00a0mg/kg) in the animals. Moreover, the effect of post-weaning treadmill exercise (TEX) and enriched environment (EE) were examined in adulthood anxiety under the drug treatments. Juvenile rats were divided into TEX/EE and control groups. The TEX/EE-juvenile rats were placed on a treadmill and then exposed to EE for five weeks. Interestingly, compared to untreated animals, post-weaning TEX/EE inhibited the anxiety induced by DXM or AM-251/DXM. It can be concluded that the MD endocannabinoid system plays an essential role in the anxiogenic effect of dextromethorphan. Moreover, post-weaning exercise alongside an enriched environment may have an inhibitory effect on adulthood anxiety-like behaviors."
