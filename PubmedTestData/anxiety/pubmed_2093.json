        "Social workers in mental health settings frequently participate in the treatment of clients with incapacitating anxiety. Medication is often included among the interventions for these clients. Social workers, who specialize in psychosocial interventions, also have key roles in the assessment and monitoring of medication effects. The purpose of this article is to provide social workers with an overview of the pharmacological treatment of anxiety so that they can carry out their range of interventions more effectively. Included is information about types of medication and their dosages, positive and adverse effects, interactions of medication with other interventions, and special concerns with children and adolescents."
