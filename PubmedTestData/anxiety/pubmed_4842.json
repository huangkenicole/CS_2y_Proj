        "Vast research has underscored negative psychological and physical effects of providing care for someone with a chronic illness. Unfortunately, caregivers of persons with a primary malignant brain tumor have received very little attention in the research literature. The purpose of this article is to review what is known regarding descriptive and interventional work in neuro-oncology caregiving and to suggest avenues for future research. A total of 36 descriptive and six intervention studies were identified for this review. Increased distress in neuro-oncology caregivers has been linked to younger age; higher levels of economic burden and unmet needs; and lower levels of social support, spirituality and caregiver mastery. Intervention research suggests that educational programs and cognitive behavioral therapy may decrease neuro-oncology caregiver distress."
