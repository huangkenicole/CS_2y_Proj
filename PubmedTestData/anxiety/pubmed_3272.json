        "Cancer patients are at increased risk for psychological difficulties and COVID-19. We sought to analyze anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors in patients with advanced cancer.",
        "A prospective, multicenter cohort of 401 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, advanced cancer completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, Michel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Herth Hope Index, and Cancer Worry Scale between February 2020 and May 2021.\u00a0Linear regression analyses explored the effects of uncertainty, hopelessness, and cancer worry on anxiety and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables.",
        "The incidence of anxiety and depression was 36% and 35%, respectively. Emotional distress was greater among women, patients\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years of age, and those with an estimated survival of\u2009>\u200918\u00a0months. Linear regression analysis revealed that being female, preoccupation about cancer, and hopelessness were associated with increased levels of anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and younger age was associated with a higher risk of anxiety. No differences in anxiety or depression levels were found in relation to marital status, children, educational level, cancer type, histology, stage, or type of treatment.",
        "Patients with advanced cancer who initiated treatment during the pandemic experienced high levels of depression and anxiety. Early diagnosis and the development of intervention strategies are necessary, especially for specific patient subgroups, such as young women with long survival times."
