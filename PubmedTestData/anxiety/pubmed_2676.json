        "To assess the anxiety and depression situation and psychological intervention effect of the first-line medical staff in our hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 384 front-line medical staff in our hospital from January 25 to March 8, 2020 were selected as subjects, which were divided into group A and group B respectively. PHQ-9 depression scale and GAD-7 self-rating anxiety scale questionnaire were used to investigate their anxiety and depression. After 1\u00a0month, all subjects were re-self-assessed for anxiety and depression, which were named as A1 and B1 group respectively. The GAD-7 anxiety scale had mild, moderate, and severe anxiety scores before group A, which were significantly higher than those in group B (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); after psychological intervention, group A1 had significantly reduced anxiety scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). And there were no markedly difference of PHQ-9 scale scores before and after psychological intervention between groups A and B, A and A1, and B and B1 (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The first-line medical staff in our hospital have different degree of anxiety and depression during COVID-19. Early positive psychological intervention has an effect on ameliorating the anxiety."
