        "This article explores the use of anticipatory interpretations early in the therapeutic process as a means of addressing the problem of premature termination with some patients. The author argues that emerging transference references, detected through a close attention to \"cautionary tales\" or derivative communications, should be used in early interpretive interventions. It is suggested that such transference references form a \"template of intention\" that help determine future difficulties in the therapeutic alliance. Being able to communicate these observations in a future-orientated way lays the groundwork for \"thinking about\" actions that threaten the therapeutic alliance when they occur, in turn curtailing the possibility of acting out through termination. The author uses two case examples to illustrate his observations and goes on to suggest that anticipatory interpretations involve: (1) isolating derivatives and underlying anxieties, (2) future-orientated transference references, and (3) an affirmation of difficulty."
