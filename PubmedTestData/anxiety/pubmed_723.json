        "Central cholecystokinin (CCK)-ergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the genesis of negative emotions. Most animal studies on the neurochemical background of CCK-induced anxiety have, up to date, exploited exploratory activity paradigms. The interaction of CCK with GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, mediated probably through CCK-B receptors, could be the neurochemical substrate for anxious type of exploratory behaviour. However, the CCK-A and CCK-B receptor-mediated interactions of this neuropeptide with mesencephalic dopaminergic regulation of motivation for locomotor activity have the potential to interfere with the behavioural outcome from routine exploratory activity tests. Systemic treatment with CCK receptor antagonists is likely to influence both GABA- and dopamine-linked CCK-ergic neurotransmission, and therefore their effects in exploratory activity tests should be interpreted with caution."
