        "Hospitalized patients and patients scheduled to undergo surgery or invasive medical procedures experience high levels of anxiety. Recently, music intervention has been evaluated for its anxiolytic effects in preoperative patients.",
        "The aim of this integrative review was to illustrate the varying methodological approaches utilized to assess the efficacy of a music intervention in reducing preoperative anxiety in adults.",
        "A total of 11 articles, meeting the inclusion criteria, were evaluated and included.",
        "Three of the eight (38%) studies, investigating the effect of listening to music on blood pressure, concluded that listening to music lowered blood pressure. Three of seven (43%) studies, investigating the relationship between listening to music and heart rate, illustrated patterns of decreased heart rates. Finally, two of four (50%) studies, investigating relaxing effects of listening to music on breathing, provided evidence of a decreased respiratory rate.",
        "There was inconsistent evidence regarding music's effectiveness in lowering blood pressure, heart rate and respirations in anxious patients. However, music intervention can still be used by nurses to create a calm, relaxing atmosphere geared towards reducing anxiety in preoperative patients."
