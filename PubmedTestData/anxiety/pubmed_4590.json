        "An association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and common psychiatric conditions, most notably anxiety and depression, has been reported. However, the magnitude of this association is poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess this issue.",
        "We comprehensively searched multiple bibliographic databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to May 15, 2023. We retrieved observational studies that reported the prevalence of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms diagnosed by validated questionnaires in \u2265100 adults (aged 18 years or older) with GERD. We also included cohort studies that explored the risk of incident GERD in subjects with anxiety/depression vice versa scenario. Finally, we included Mendelian randomization studies that assessed the cause-and-effect relationship between anxiety/depression and GERD. The extracted data were combined using a random-effects model.",
        "In total, 36 eligible studies were included. The pooled prevalences of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 34.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.7-44.2; I2 = 99.4%) and 24.2% (95% CI 19.9-28.5; I2 = 98.8%) in subjects with GERD based on 30 studies, respectively. Both anxiety and depressive symptoms were more common in subjects with GERD compared with those in healthy controls (odds ratio = 4.46 [95% CI 1.94-10.25] and odds ratio = 2.56 [95% CI 1.11-5.87], respectively). According to 3 cohort studies, subjects with GERD were at an increased risk of developing anxiety/depression and vice versa. Finally, 3 Mendelian randomization studies showed that genetic liability to these mood disorders is linked to an increased risk of developing GERD and vice versa.",
        "Up to 1 in 3 subjects with GERD experience anxiety and depression. There is likely a bidirectional causal relationship between anxiety/depression and GERD."
