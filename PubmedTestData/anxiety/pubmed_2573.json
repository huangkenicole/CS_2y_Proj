        "Individuals considered to suffer from multiple chemical sensitivities comprise a heterogeneous grouping. Regardless of the original etiology of symptoms, these individuals tend to amplify their symptoms and to develop the mistaken belief that these symptoms are indicative of severe disease. Cognitive processes and anxiety contribute to amplification of symptoms and disability, and cognitive and behavioral techniques appear to be clinically useful in alleviating symptoms and disability. Specific psychiatric disorders, in particular major depression, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and somatization disorder, may be confused or associated with MCS. When present, specific treatment of these psychiatric disorders is essential."
