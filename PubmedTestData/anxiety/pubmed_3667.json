        "This cross-sectional study investigates the relationship between problematic metacognitions, negative cognitive content and emotional distress, and migraine-related disability among adult migraine patients. The migraine group consisted of 74 patients. Forty-seven healthy volunteers with similar sociodemographic characteristics were selected as the comparison group. Sociodemographic form, Migraine Disability Assessment Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Automatic Thought Questionnaire, and Metacognition Questionnaire-30 were administered. Our results showed that higher depression, anxiety, stress levels, and negative automatic thoughts are significantly associated with more significant migraine disability. Our data also showed that high levels of depression and increased headache frequency predict migraine-related severe disability. We found that the frequency of headaches over three months and positive beliefs about worry significantly predicted the presence of chronicity in migraine. Our findings may help determine different approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy and relaxation techniques in treating migraine."
