        "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been suggested as an effective mind-body approach for relieving stress in patients with chronic diseases. As of yet, there is no conclusive research on MBSR's role in reducing affective disorders among cancer patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether MBSR has an impact on loneliness, anxiety, and depression in cancer patients.",
        "Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the start of these databases to January 2nd, 2022 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. Two authors independently conducted the literature search, collected the data, and performed the statistical analysis. In order to account for potential between-study heterogeneity, a random-effect model was used in the meta-analysis.",
        "The meta-analysis included 16 studies with 2072 cancer patients. Among the 16 studies, 13 included patients with breast cancer, and the follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 53 weeks. Compared to controls receiving standard cancer care, interventions of MBSR with sessions for 6 to 8 weeks significantly improved loneliness (standard mean difference [SMD]: -0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.59 to -0.12, P\u2005=\u2005.003, I2\u2005=\u200546%), anxiety (SMD: -0.51, 95% CI: -0.73 to -0.30, P\u2005<\u2005.001, I2\u2005=\u200577%), and depression (SMD: -0.61, 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.20, P\u2005=\u2005.004, I2\u2005=\u200594%) in patients with cancer.",
        "According to recent research, MBSR may be beneficial to patients diagnosed with cancer who are feeling lonely, anxious, or depressed."
