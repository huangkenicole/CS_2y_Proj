        "Enteropathic spondyloarthritis (ESpA) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have high impact on physical and psychological health but health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has never been evaluated in ESpA patients.",
        "Cross-sectional multidisciplinary study was performed to evaluate HRQoL, state of health, and well-being in IBD and ESpA patients.",
        "Consecutive IBD and ESpA outpatients were enrolled. Disease activity, inflammatory parameters, function, and quality of life (EuroQol questionnaire) were assessed at visit time and compared with 12 months ago.",
        "Two hundred fifty-three IBD patients were evaluated. Ninety-five patients met inclusion criteria. ESpA was established in 65.3% IBD patients. Most ESpA patients had discreet or good health perception (65.3% and 22.5%, respectively), similar to IBD group (64.6% and 20.7%, respectively). In both groups, no patients had exceptional state of general well-being. Compared with previous 12 months, ESpA group showed improved state of health in 12% of patients, worsening in 28% and stable state of health in 60%. Similar results were obtained in IBD group. Emotional and psychological problems (anxiety, depression, and feeling of loneliness and isolation) were reported: In ESpA patients, these feelings were observed in 58.1%, 40.57%, and 29% of cases, respectively; IBD patients showed slightly lower percentage. More than half of ESpA and IBD patients reported an embarrassment about their condition and worry about disease's future progression and physical pain.",
        "Well-being, quality of life, and psychological problems were described in ESpA and IBD patients. Disease management should include also social, mental, and psychological impacts, in terms of QoL."
