        "Financial worry is an under-appreciated negative effect of cancer. The relationship of financial worry and health behaviors in cancer is poorly characterized and has important clinical implications. This study examined the association of financial worry with substance misuse, mood, and quality of life.",
        "People with cancer (n\u2009=\u20091473; 6 to 20\u00a0months after diagnosis) were recruited from a SEER cancer registry in the Pacific Northwest. Participants completed an online survey assessing financial worry; misuse of cannabis, alcohol, and prescription drugs; tobacco smoking status; quality of life (physical and mental dimensions); anxiety; and depression. Multivariable regressions tested the association of financial worry to each health indicator and outcome.",
        "In adjusted analyses, financial worry was associated with being a current vs. never smoker (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 3.60), and a positive screen for an anxiety (OR\u2009=\u20093.01, 95% CI: 1.93, 4.68) and depressive (OR\u2009=\u20093.08, 95% CI: 1.89, 5.00) disorder. Financial worry was not associated with cannabis, alcohol, or prescription drug misuse (all ps\u2009>\u20090.05), but was associated with a decrease in physical (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20092.97, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20094.15,\u2009-\u20091.79) and mental (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20095.27, 95% CI:\u2009-\u20096.59,\u2009-\u20093.96) quality of life.",
        "Financial worry among cancer survivors is associated with anxiety, depression, and worse quality of life. Of the evaluated substances, there was only an increased odds of current tobacco use with financial worry. Future longitudinal studies should inform the relationships between these factors.",
        "Financial worry and material hardship may both need to be addressed in cancer survivorship."
