        "The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the effect of walking into the operating room on preoperative anxiety level. Sixty non-premedicated patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into two groups based on how they were transported into the operating room. One group was carried on a stretcher (n = 30) and the other entered on foot under their own power (n = 30). A subjective assessment of anxiety was performed using a state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) the day before surgery and on arrival at the operating room. STAI values were not increased in the operating room as compared to the day before surgery for either group and did not differ between groups, though they showed a high level of anxiety throughout the preoperative period. We conclude that walking into the operating room has no significant influence on preoperative anxiety level."
