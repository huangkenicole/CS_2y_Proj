      "AbstractText": [
        "The Lebanese population has undergone several conflicts and were the most afflicted by shelling and chaos during the civil war from 1975 to 1990, or even by displacement, bereavement, emigration, family separations, not to mention the economic crises that have hit the country since 2019 under which young adults are still succumbing. Our study aims to validate the Lebanese Anxiety Scale and assess correlates of anxiety among Lebanese adolescents.",
        "A cross-sectional study was carried between January and May 2019, using a proportionate random sampling of schools from all five Lebanese governorates, among which 1810 adolescents aged 14 to 17\u2009years.",
        "All LAS items remained in the model and formed one factor solution that explained 61.38% of the total variance (KMO\u2009=\u20090.873; p<sub>Bartlett test</sub>\u2009<\u20090.001), with an excellent Cronbach's alpha of 0.93. Higher neglect (B\u2009=\u20090.38), insomnia (B\u2009=\u20090.21) and child psychological abuse (B\u2009=\u20090.08) were significantly associated with more anxiety. Those results were considered adjusted overall sociodemographic variables since the latter had no statistically significant association with anxiety.",
        "The study confirmed the association between anxiety and some variables such as psychological child abuse, neglect, and insomnia and emphasized the correlation between anxiety and these factors. Further, the LAS appears to be a short, valid and efficient tool for assessing anxiety among Lebanese adolescents. Further studies need to be carried to evaluate whether the LAS-10 gives a similar diagnosis to psychiatrists."
