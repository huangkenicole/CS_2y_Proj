        "Autonomic hyperarousal has been proposed as a dispositional risk factor for anxiety disorders (ADs). Therefore, we studied physiological arousal in offspring of fathers and mothers with and without ADs and whether infant hyperarousal predicts subsequent fearful temperament.",
        "Infants (N\u00a0=\u00a0128; age\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0months) did a novel stimuli task (exposure to visual, olfactory, and acoustic stimuli and an unfamiliar male) and a habituation task (exposure to a repeated acoustic stimulus). Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured during baseline, stimuli and post-stimuli rest. Parents' AD status and severity were measured using a diagnostic interview and their fearful temperament using a questionnaire. Child fearful temperament was measured at 4\u00a0months, 1\u00a0year and 2.5\u00a0years with observations during structured tasks.",
        "Parents' fearful temperament (significant in the habituation task), AD status (significant in the novel stimuli task) and AD severity (significant in both tasks) predicted a higher HR in their infants. Infants' higher HR reactivity to novel stimuli and diminished HR recovery at 4\u00a0months predicted a more fearful temperament during infancy and toddlerhood. Infants' higher HR at 4\u00a0months predicted a more fearful temperament at 2.5\u00a0years.",
        "Parental prenatal anxiety (disorders) predicted infants' autonomic arousal, which in turn predicted later fearful temperament in children. Outcomes suggest that autonomic hyperarousal is a dispositional risk factor of ADs."
