        "The aim of the study was to determine standardized perioperative nursing for radiofrequency ablation of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy under the guidance of intracardiac ultrasound, which can improve the quality of nursing.",
        "From January 2020 to November 2021, 40 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who underwent radiofrequency ablation under the guidance of intracardiac ultrasound in our hospital were selected. Patients were grouped according to their use of standardized perioperative nursing. Patients from both cohorts were compared for negative emotions, depression, and anxiety at the baseline and at month 2.",
        "In general, there were no differences between the two groups (<i>P</i>\u2009>\u20090.05). At admission, the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores of these two groups showed no differences (<i>P</i>\u2009>\u20090.05). Following nursing, the scores of the two groups dropped significantly, with the control group scoring much lower than the experimental group. Among the experimental group, the satisfaction rate was 100.00%, whereas the control group had an 85.00% satisfaction rate (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). Following nursing, the scores of the two groups dropped significantly, with the control group scoring much lower than the experimental group.",
        "To sum up, perioperative comprehensive nursing intervention during surgical treatment can quickly alleviate patients' clinical symptoms, reduce complications, damage to patients' body, reduce patients' pain, relieve patients' anxiety and depression, and improve overall sleep quality and clinical nursing satisfaction."
