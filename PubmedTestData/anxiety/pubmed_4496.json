        "Worry is the central characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and obsessions are a central feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). There are strong similarities between these disorders: repetitive cognitive intrusions, negative emotions, difficulty dismissing the intrusion and finally, loss of mental control. Direct comparisons between obsessions and worries are almost non-existent in the literature but key distinctions have been proposed. The study attempted to specify the differences between obsessive intrusive thoughts and worry in a nonclinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). 254 students participated in the study. They first identified an obsession-like intrusion and a worry and then evaluated them with the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Within-subject comparisons demonstrated significant differences on several variables: frequency, duration, percentage of verbal and image content, interference, egodystonic nature, stimuli awareness, emotions, etc. Most of these differences remained significant after controlling for frequency of thought. Discriminant analysis demonstrated a low classification error rate when using nine variables to categorize thoughts as obsessions or worries. Results generally support the differences postulated in the literature with the exception that obsessive intrusive thoughts are better controlled. The egodystonic/egosyntonic dimension emerged as an important variable in understanding obsessions and worry."
