      "AbstractText": [
        "Adolescence is a period of transition during which there is extensive development of the brain and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, the term adolescence is broad and covers a number of important developmental periods ranging from pre-pubescence to sexual maturity. Using a predator stress model, we investigated the effects of chronic psychological stress on anxiety-like, depression-like, and social behaviours in male and female mice during early adolescence, when mice are pre-pubertal, and late adolescence, when mice are sexually mature. All stressed mice showed hyperactivity and increased anxiety-like behaviours. The anxiogenic effects were generally more pronounced in mice exposed to late, rather than early adolescent stress, but were clearly evident when stress was experienced at either timepoint. Risk assessment behaviours were also affected by the stress treatments, but the direction of these changes were sometimes sex- and age-specific. Surprisingly, mice stressed during adolescence showed no depressive-like behaviours as adults. This study provides evidence that adolescent psychological stress has pronounced long-term anxiogenic effects but that the precise behavioural phenotype differs based on sex and the sub-stage of adolescence during which the individual is exposed."
