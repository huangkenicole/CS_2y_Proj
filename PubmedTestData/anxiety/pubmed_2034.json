        "Surgical experiences are often stressful for children and their parents. This study aimed to determine the effect of a group game intervention on the preoperative anxiety levels of 94 parent-child dyads who were awaiting elective minor surgery at a pediatric surgery clinic. The experimental group intervention included routine preoperative preparation and a group (ie, child, parent, and researcher) game. After the parent dressed the child for surgery, a research team member assessed the child's and parent's anxiety levels using the Facial Affective Scale and Visual Facial Anxiety Scale, respectively. Before the child was transferred to the OR, the research team member reassessed both anxiety levels. When compared to the control group, the results showed that children and parents involved in facilitated group play experienced significantly decreased anxiety levels (P < .001)."
