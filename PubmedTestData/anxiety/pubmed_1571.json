        "The authors developed a measure to determine whether maternal motivation to be present during induction (Motivation for Parental Presence during Induction of Anesthesia [MPPIA]) is related to children's anxiety during the induction process.",
        "Mothers and children (aged 2-12 yr) undergoing outpatient, elective surgery and general anesthesia were enrolled in this study (n = 289 dyads). Items to assess motivation for parental presence during induction were selected by experts in anesthesiology, psychology, and child development; mothers completed the resulting 14-item measure as well as assessments of anxiety and coping style. Children's anxiety and compliance was assessed during induction of anesthesia. Factor analysis was performed, and maternal motivation was then examined against children's anxiety during induction of anesthesia.",
        "Factor analysis resulted in four scales with a total variance of 72.3%: MPPIA-Desire, MPPIA-Hesitancy, MPPIA-Anxiety, and MPPIA-Preparation. Analysis supported the reliability (0.89-0.94) and validity of the MPPIA. The authors found that mothers with high MPPIA-Desire and low MPPIA-Hesitancy had children with significantly higher anxiety (P < 0.0001) during induction of anesthesia, as compared with mothers with low MPPIA-Desire and MPPIA-Hesitancy. The authors also found that highly motivated mothers reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (P = 0.007).",
        "Clinicians should be aware that many mothers who have a high desire to be present in the operating room are very anxious and that their children are likely to exhibit high anxiety levels during induction of anesthesia."
