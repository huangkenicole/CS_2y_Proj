        "Students with borderline intellectual functioning (\"slow learners\") underperform in all school subjects. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the self-perceived anxiety symptoms of slow learners. Its secondary objective was to analyze impact of sociodemographic variables on their symptoms.",
        "Cross-sectional single-arm questionnaire-based study was conducted in the learning disability clinic of a public medical college in Mumbai.",
        "One hundred slow learners aged \u22658 to <18 years were recruited by non-probability sampling. Their anxiety symptoms scores were measured using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders-Child version (SCARED-C) instrument.",
        "Multivariate regression analysis was performed for determining the \"independent\" impact that variables had on the SCARED-C (\"individual subscales\" and \"overall\") scores.",
        "Symptoms of \"separation anxiety\" were present in 40%, followed by \"social anxiety\" in 32%, \"generalized anxiety\" in 31%, \"panic\" in 26%, \"significant school avoidance\" in 24%; and \"overall anxiety\" in 38% of slow learners. Multivariate analysis revealed that: (i) co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was significantly associated with having panic symptoms (P = 0.040), and, (ii) studying in a Secondary School Certificate or Higher Secondary Certificate educational board-affiliated school was significantly associated with having symptoms of \"generalized anxiety,\" \"social anxiety,\" and \"overall anxiety\" (P = 0.009, P = 0.026, and P = 0.046, respectively).",
        "Many slow learners in our city have symptoms of anxiety disorders and overall anxiety. There is an urgent need to screen them for anxiety disorders to facilitate their optimum rehabilitation."
