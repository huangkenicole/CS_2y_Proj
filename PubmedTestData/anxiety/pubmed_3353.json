        "To recommend a cut-off score for the brief 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) measure for persons with spinal cord injuries/disorders (PwSCI/D) and to estimate anxiety occurrence within this population using the full 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7).",
        "Multicenter retrospective analyses.",
        "One inpatient rehabilitation center and 2 community sites for PwSCI/D.",
        "PwSCI/D 18 years or older (N=909) were included for analysis using retrospectively collected GAD-2 and GAD-7 data.",
        "Not applicable.",
        "Occurrence of anxiety symptoms were compared using cut-off scores of \u22658 and \u226510 on the GAD-7. A cut-off score recommendation for the GAD-2 was determined using ROC curve, and sensitivity and specificity analyses.",
        "Occurrence of anxiety symptoms was 21% using a GAD-7 cut-off of \u22658 and 15% using a cut-off of \u226510. Analyses indicated optimal sensitivity for a GAD-2 score of \u22652 when a GAD-7 cut-off of \u22658 was used.",
        "Anxiety occurrence is elevated among PwSCI/D compared with the general population. For PwSCI/D, it is recommended that a cut-off score of \u22652 is used for the GAD-2 to maximize sensitivity and that a threshold of \u22658 is used for the GAD-7 to ensure the maximum number of individuals presenting with symptoms of anxiety are recognized for diagnostic interview. Study limitations are discussed."
