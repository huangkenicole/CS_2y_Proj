        "To assess the effects of breathing techniques training on anxiety levels of pregnant women and the duration of labor.",
        "The study utilizes a randomized controlled trial design. The pregnant women were divided into control (n\u00a0=\u00a035) or experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a035) randomly. The experimental group received breathing techniques training in the latent phase and these techniques were applied in the following phases accordingly. The anxiety levels of pregnant women were evaluated three times in total. The duration of labor was considered as the duration of the first stage of labor and the duration of the second stage of labor.",
        "There were significant differences between the two groups regarding the mean State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and the mean duration of labor.",
        "This study concludes that breathing techniques are an effective method in the reduction of anxiety and influence the duration of delivery during labor."
