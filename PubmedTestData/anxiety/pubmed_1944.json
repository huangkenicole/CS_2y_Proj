        "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bedside Entertainment and Relaxation Theater (BERT) on fear, anxiety, and pain outcomes in pediatric orthopaedic patients associated with cast removal and/or pin removal in the outpatient clinic setting.",
        "A total of 66 pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 6 undergoing clinic procedures were recruited for this study and randomized into the control group or the intervention (BERT) group. Patients in the control group received standard of care during the cast room procedure; patients in the BERT group were given headphones and watched a movie on a projector during the procedure. Fear, anxiety, and pain were measured before and after the procedure. Procedures included cast removal, pin removal, or a combination of the 2.",
        "Patients in the BERT group reported less fear and anxiety overall after the procedure than patients in the control group (P=0.009, 0.015). Adjusting for procedure type (ie, pin removal), patients in the BERT group reported a 0.67 point decrease (95% confidence interval: 0.04, 1.30) on the fear scale after the procedure (P=0.039) and a 1.81 point decrease (95% confidence interval: 0.04, 3.59) on the anxiety scale associated with the procedure (P=0.045), compared with the control group. Patients and caregivers reported high satisfaction with BERT.",
        "This randomized, controlled trial demonstrates an evidence-based distraction tool that can be implemented across medical centers for pediatric patients undergoing office based orthopaedic procedures. BERT can be used to reduce fear and anxiety associated with these procedures, and increase patient and parent satisfaction.",
