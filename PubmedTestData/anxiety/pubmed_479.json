        "To force somebody means inflict pressure on him. Obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB) is a feature of relationships. In early infancy, repetitive biological functions rapidly become automatic psychic functions. Small children often try to relate to their surrounding in a constrained manner in order to re-establish their omnipotence. Play and transitional space are opposites of OCB. Anxiety and constraints show an inverse relation to each other. In many cases, OCB in infants and small children has no clinical relevance. OCB is characterised by a high intrapsychic persistence during the whole period of psychophysic development. Obsessive-compulsive diseases (OCD) may serve as defence against oedipal strivings or against psychotic functioning. It is addressed against the self, an inner object or a relevant person of the surrounding. OCD correspond to a relational illness. In this situation an involved person becomes rapidly involved in the constraint problem. To maintain an adequate form of relationship within such transferential movements, a continuous \"unchaining\" is necessary. During transference, regressive anxieties and rages are expressed in a personalised form. Verbalised by the therapist, they become ready for transformation. The relationship may now open up to allow the inclusion of a third person."
