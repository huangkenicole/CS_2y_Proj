        "This study investigated whether intensive group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with family involvement for children with anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) would facilitate children's return to their daily routines. The focus shifted from the usual emphasis on remission to an improvement in functioning. The aim was to capture potentially missed gains when children pursue their fears and engage in more adaptive behaviors as these efforts may result in ongoing symptoms. Two hundred twelve children and adolescents aged 8-19\u2009years old, who were patients in an intensive outpatient group-based treatment program at an academic hospital, participated in this study. Results indicated that both children and their parents endorsed significant improvement in children's functioning from admission to discharge. Symptom reduction was assessed for reference, and both children and parents reported significant decreases in child anxiety symptoms from admission to discharge, and children endorsed decreases in their comorbid depression symptoms. Short-term group-based intensive treatment in a clinical setting may help children return to their daily activities quickly."
