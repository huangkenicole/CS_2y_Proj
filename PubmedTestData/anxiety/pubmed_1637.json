        "The purpose of this experimental study was to examine the effects of intraoperative progress reports on family members' state anxiety level (STAI S-Anxiety), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate during elective surgical procedures. Family members of randomly selected surgical patients were eligible to participate. Control group family members (n = 50) received usual care. Family members in the experimental group (n = 50) received a 5- to 10-minute progress report protocol about halfway through a surgical procedure. Families' STAI S-Anxiety scores, MAP, and heart rates were compared between the control and experimental groups using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Family members in the experimental group reported lower STAI S-Anxiety scores (p < .001), and had significantly lower MAP and heart rates than did the control group (p < .001). Progress reports appear to be a beneficial nursing intervention for reducing anxiety in family members during the intraoperative period."
