        "We review recent research validating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a first-line intervention for childhood anxiety disorders. We also review recent research aimed at enhancing exposure-based CBT components and adapting CBT to work with specific populations.",
        "Exposure-based CBT is a well-established intervention. Different research groups have found positive evidence to augment CBT by evaluating inhibitory learning principles, the role of parents in child treatment, an individualized case formulation, computer and online forms of CBT, and virtual and augmented reality systems for exposure practice. Specific programs have been developed to meet specific needs of preschoolers, adolescents, and children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder and anxiety. Successful adaptations to CBT exist and the field should continue to improve the generalizability, feasibility, and expected benefit of CBT to improve its effectiveness."
