        "In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effects of a client-centered lifestyle intervention for women with fibromyalgia syndrome on the levels of disease severity, occupational participation, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction. The quasi-experimental controlled study was conducted at Occupational Therapy Department of Hacettepe University in Turkey between January 2018 and May 2018. Based on the literature review and basic assessments, a lifestyle intervention program was designed focusing both on the participants' occupational goals and the effects of fibromyalgia symptoms. The results were measured using the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Significant differences were found in intervention group compared to control in terms of COPM-Performance (<i>p</i> = .001), COPM-Satisfaction (<i>p</i> = .001), HADS-Anxiety (<i>p</i> = .009), and HADS-Depression (<i>p</i> = .001). Although FIQR and SWLS levels improved positively in the intervention group (respectively; <i>p</i> = .001 and <i>p</i> =.012), there was no difference between the groups. According to these results, the client-centered and occupation-based lifestyle intervention applied to individuals with fibromyalgia could be effective on occupational participation and psychological symptoms."
