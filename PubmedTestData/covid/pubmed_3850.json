        "Genomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to provide valuable insight into the ever-changing variant makeup of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than three million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), but contributions from the United States, particularly through 2020, lagged the global effort. The primary goal of clinical microbiology laboratories is seldom rooted in epidemiologic or public health testing, and many laboratories do not contain in-house sequencing technology. However, we recognized the need for clinical microbiologists to lend expertise, share specimen resources, and partner with academic laboratories and sequencing cores to assist in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic sequencing efforts. Here, we describe two clinical and academic laboratory collaborations for SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing. We highlight roles of the clinical microbiologists and the academic laboratories, outline best practices, describe two divergent strategies in accomplishing a similar goal, and discuss the challenges with implementing and maintaining such programs."
