        "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for the effectiveness of Favipiravir on\u00a0the\u00a0fatality and\u00a0the\u00a0requirement of mechanical ventilation for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. We searched available literature and reported\u00a0it\u00a0by using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Until June 1, 2021, we searched PubMed,\u00a0bioRxiv,\u00a0medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and\u00a0Google Scholar\u00a0by using the keywords \"Favipiravir\" and terms synonymous with COVID-19. Studies for Favipiravir treatment compared to standard of care among moderate and severe COVID-19 patients were included. Risk\u00a0of\u00a0bias assessment was performed using Revised Cochrane risk\u00a0of\u00a0bias tool for randomized trials (RoB\u00a02) and ROBINS-I assessment tool for non-randomized studies. We defined the outcome measures as fatality and requirement for mechanical ventilation. A total of\u00a02702 studies were identified\u00a0and 12 clinical trials with 1636 patients were analyzed. Nine\u00a0out\u00a0of 12 studies were randomized controlled trials. Among the randomized studies, one study has low risk of bias, six studies have moderate risk of bias,\u00a0and 2 studies have high risk of bias. Observational studies were identified as having moderate risk of bias and non-randomized study was found to have serious risk of bias. Our meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the intervention and the comparator on fatality rate (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.94) and mechanical ventilation requirement (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13-1.95). There is no significant difference in fatality rate and mechanical ventilation requirement between Favipiravir treatment and the standard of care in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients."
