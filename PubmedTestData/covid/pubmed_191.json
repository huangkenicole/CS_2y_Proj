      "AbstractText": [
        "Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a prominent molecular chaperone, effectively limits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but little is known about any interaction between Hsp90 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we systematically analyzed the effects of the chaperone isoforms Hsp90\u03b1 and Hsp90\u03b2 on individual SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Five SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and accessory proteins Orf3, Orf7a, and Orf7b were found to be novel clients of Hsp90\u03b2 in particular. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 with 17-DMAG results in N protein proteasome-dependent degradation. Hsp90 depletion-induced N protein degradation is independent of CHIP, a ubiquitin E3 ligase previously identified for Hsp90 client proteins, but alleviated by FBXO10, an E3 ligase identified by subsequent siRNA screening. We also provide evidence that Hsp90 depletion may suppress SARS-CoV-2 assembly partially through induced M or N degradation. Additionally, we found that GSDMD-mediated pyroptotic cell death triggered by SARS-CoV-2 was mitigated by inhibition of Hsp90. These findings collectively highlight a beneficial role for targeting of Hsp90 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly inhibiting virion production and reducing inflammatory injury by preventing the pyroptosis that contributes to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease."
