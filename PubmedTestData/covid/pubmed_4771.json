        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global emergency outbreak disease that devastatingly affected world public health and the economy. The pathogenesis of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans has been linked to a strong immunological response that leads to a hyperinflammatory state, or \"cytokine storm,\" which is a sepsis-like state resulting in capillary leakage, microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, and multiple organ destruction. In recent years, there have been several case series and few randomized controlled trials studying the effectiveness and risk of various hemoperfusion techniques in the context of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection including HA330, CytoSorb, Polymyxin, oXiris, and Seraph 100 cartridges. Because inconsistencies exist between studies, there is currently no consensus regarding the use of hemoperfusion in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further well-designed research is needed to validate its potential clinical benefits and identify the timing and characteristics of patients who might benefit the most."
