      "AbstractText": [
        "We aimed to investigate the genetic mechanisms associated with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the host and to evaluate the possible associations between smoking and drinking behavior and three COVID-19 outcomes: severe COVID-19, hospitalized COVID-19 and COVID-19 infection. We described the genomic loci and risk genes associated with the COVID-19 outcomes, followed by functional analyses of the risk genes. Then, a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis, and a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) were performed for the severe COVID-19 dataset. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to evaluate the causal associations between various measures of smoking and alcohol consumption and the COVID-19 outcomes. A total of 26 protein-coding genes, enriched in chemokine binding, cytokine binding and senescence-related functions, were associated with either severe COVID-19 or hospitalized COVID-19. The SMR and the TWAS analyses highlighted functional implications of some GWAS hits and identified seven novel genes for severe COVID-19, including CCR5, CCR5AS, IL10RB, TAC4, RMI1 and TNFSF15, some of which are targets of approved or experimental drugs. According to our studies, increasing consumption of cigarettes per day by 1 standard deviation is related to a 2.3-fold increase in susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and a 1.6-fold increase in COVID-19-induced hospitalization. Contrarily, no significant links were found between alcohol consumption or binary smoking status and COVID-19 outcomes. Our study revealed some novel COVID-19 related genes and suggested that genetic liability to smoking may quantitatively contribute to an increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19."
