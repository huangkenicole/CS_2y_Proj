        "Type V and VI CRISPR enzymes are RNA-guided, DNA and RNA-targeting effectors that allow specific gene knockdown. Cas12 and Cas13 are CRISPR proteins that are efficient agents for diagnosis and combating single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. The programmability of these proteins paves the way for the detection and degradation of RNA viruses by targeting RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Approximately two-thirds of viruses causing diseases contain ssRNA genomes. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has infected more than 88 million people worldwide with near 2 million deaths since December 2019. Thus, accurate and rapid diagnostic and therapeutic tools are essential for early detection and treatment of this widespread infectious disease. For us, the CRISPR based platforms seem to be a plausible new approach for an accurate detection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we talk about Cas12 and Cas13 CRISPR systems and their applications in diagnosis and treatment of RNA virus mediated diseases. In continue, the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and its conventional diagnostics and antivirals will be discussed. Moreover, we highlight novel CRISPR based diagnostic platforms and therapies for COVID-19. We also discuss the challenges of diagnostic CRISPR based platforms as well as clarifying the proposed solution for high efficient selective in vivo delivery of CRISPR components into SARS-CoV-2-infected cells."
