        "Rapid, sensitive, on-site identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections is an important tool in the control and management of COVID-19. We have developed a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) immunoassay for highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. Single-chain Fv (scFv) recombinant antibody fragments that bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were isolated by biopanning a human scFv library. ScFvs were conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles and SERS nanotags, followed by immunocomplex formation and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a limit of detection of 257 fg/mL in 30 min in viral transport medium. The assay also detected B.1.1.7 (\"alpha\"), B.1.351 (\"beta\"), and B.1.617.2 (\"delta\") spike proteins, while no cross-reactivity was observed with the common human coronavirus HKU1 spike protein. Inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected at 4.1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> genomes/mL, which was 10-100-fold lower than virus loads typical of infectious individuals. The assay exhibited higher sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 than commercial lateral flow assays, was compatible with viral transport media and saliva, enabled rapid pivoting to detect new virus variants, and facilitated highly sensitive, point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19 in clinical and public health settings."
