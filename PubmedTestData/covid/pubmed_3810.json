        "The disruption to people's lives, including financial impacts, morbidity and loss of life caused by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic requires a dramatic transformation of cancer care delivery, including supportive care. This paper focuses on issues of supportive care in the context of the pandemic, and the extent to which these issues will impact supportive cancer care post-COVID-19.",
        "Cancer care, including supportive care delivery, has had to be dramatically altered during the COVID-19 pandemic, including reallocation of human resources, repurposing of existing physical space, amplified use of telehealth and other remote patient monitoring technologies, changes to treatment and follow-up care patient schedules, among others. These changes have resulted in psychosocial sequelae for cancer patients (including anxiety, stress, loss of control), financial toxicity, and risk of disengagement from treatment and follow-up care.",
        "COVID-19 has seriously disrupted cancer treatment and supportive care for patients and survivors. This paper highlights implications for clinical practice during and post-COVID-19, including the durability of practice adaptations and opportunities for research into mechanisms to support supportive care post the pandemic, including the advancement of eHealth technologies and alternative models of care that integrate community resources, primary care and allied health disciplines."
