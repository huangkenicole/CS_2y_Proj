      "AbstractText": [
        "To support the implementation of high-throughput pipelines suitable for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and analysis in a clinical laboratory, we developed an automated sample preparation and analysis workflow.",
        "We used the established ARTIC protocol with approximately 400\u2005bp amplicons sequenced on Oxford Nanopore's MinION. Sequences were analyzed using Nextclade, assigning both a clade and quality score to each sample.",
        "A total of 2179 samples on twenty-five 96-well plates were sequenced. Plates of purified RNA were processed within 12\u2005h, sequencing required up to 24\u2005h, and analysis of each pooled plate required 1\u2005h. The use of samples with known threshold cycle (Ct) values enabled normalization, acted as a quality control check, and revealed a strong correlation between sample Ct values and successful analysis, with 85% of samples with Ct\u2009<\u200930 achieving a \"good\" Nextclade score. Less abundant samples responded to enrichment with the fraction of Ct\u2009>\u200930 samples achieving a \"good\" classification rising by 60% after addition of a post-ARTIC PCR normalization. Serial dilutions of 3 variant of concern samples, diluted from approximately Ct\u2009=\u200916 to approximately Ct\u2009=\u200950, demonstrated successful sequencing to Ct\u2005=\u200537. The sample set contained a median of 24 mutations per sample and a total of 1281 unique mutations with reduced sequence read coverage noted in some regions of some samples. A total of 10 separate strains were observed in the sample set, including 3 variants of concern prevalent in British Columbia in the spring of 2021.",
        "We demonstrated a robust automated sequencing pipeline that takes advantage of input Ct values to improve reliability."
