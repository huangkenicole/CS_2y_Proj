      "AbstractText": [
        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causal factor of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing, portraying patented drugs as a successful drug development technique, could shorten the period and minimize costs relative to de novo drug exploration. Recently several drugs have been used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Nafamostat mesylate and so on. Despite such efforts, there is currently no successful broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures to combat SARS-CoV-2 or possibly potential CoVs pandemic. Therefore it is desperately important to recognize and test widely efficient, reliable anti-CoV therapies now and in the future. Remdesivir and Favipiravir were more promising despite having side effects; it had prominent efficacy and efficiency while still not yet approved as the official anti-viral drug for SARS CoV-2. In this review, we summarizes the current drug and vaccine discovery status against SARS-CoV-2, predicting that these efforts will help create effective drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2."
