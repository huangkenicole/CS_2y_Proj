        "As per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium (VTM) are to be stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for less than 5 days and for more than 5 days at -70\u00a0\u00b0C. Samples are not transported or stored as per prescribed conditions because of the limitations, resulting in an apprehensive diagnosis. The aim of the study was to test the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 sample stored in VTM at different temperatures.",
        "In this study, the stability of 21 positive and 9 negative samples for SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in commercial VTM at different temperatures (-80\u00a0\u00b0C, -20\u00a0\u00b0C, 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and 25 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C). Stability was checked for up to 50 days in the above storage conditions at different intervals. PathoDetect\u2122 and Hi-PCR\u00ae kits were used for the detection of the four genes of SARS-CoV-2. The Cycle Threshold (Ct) value for determining the positivity of samples for PathoDetect\u2122 was <\u200940 and for Hi-PCR\u00ae was <\u200938.",
        "The SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory genes (RdRp and E genes) and the internal housekeeping gene remained detectable even on the 50th day of the study. The Ct of the RdRp and E genes were found to increase with storage duration, but all positive samples remained positive till the end of the study, or the Ct value remained below the cut-off level. The negative samples gave consistent results until the end of the study. When the differences in Ct values were compared between the days in a set of experiments, they were not significantly different except in a few samples.",
        "The SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in commercial VTM were stable at room temperature to -80\u00a0\u00b0C for 50 days."
