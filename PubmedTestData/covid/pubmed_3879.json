      "AbstractText": [
        "In the current COVID-19 pandemic, early and rapid diagnosis of potentially infected and contagious individuals enables containment of the disease through quarantine and contact tracing. The rapid global expansion of these diagnostic testing services raises questions concerning the current state of the art with regard to standardization of testing and quality assessment practices. The aim of this study was to provide a global overview of the test methods, laboratory procedures and quality assessment practices used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.",
        "The Molecular Diagnostics Committee of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC C-MD) initiated a survey among international laboratories performing molecular genetic detection of SARS-CoV-2. Questions on quality assurance, variant testing, sequencing and the transmission of findings were included in the survey.",
        "A total of 273 laboratories from 49 countries participated in the survey. The majority of the participating laboratories (92.2%) use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The majority of participating laboratories do not conduct testing to identify SARS CoV-2 variants. Participation in external quality assessment programs was reported by the majority of laboratories, however, 33.2% of the laboratories reported not participating in external quality assurance programmes.",
        "Based on the survey, molecular diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection are clearly not standardized across different countries and laboratories. The survey found an array of responses in regard to sample preparation, collection, processing and reporting of results. This work suggests quality assurance is insufficiently performed by diagnostic laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 testing."
