        "The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused the most unfathomable pandemic in the history of humankind. Bangladesh is also a victim of this critical situation. To investigate the genomic features of the pathogen from Bangladesh, the first complete genome of the virus has very recently been published. Therefore, long-awaited questions regarding the possible origin and typing of the strain(s) can now be answered. Here, we endeavor to mainly discuss the published reports or online-accessed data (results) regarding those issues and present a comprehensive picture of the typing of the virus alongside the probable origin of the subclade containing the Bangladeshi strain. Our observation suggested that this strain might have originated from the United Kingdom or the other European countries epidemiologically linked to the United Kingdom. According to different genotyping classification schemes, this strain belongs to the A2a clade under the G major clade, is of B and/or L type, and is a SARS-CoV-2a substrain. In the future, randomized genomic data will certainly increase in Bangladesh, however because of globalization and immigrant movement, we urgently need a mass regional sequencing approach targeting the partial or complete genome that can link the epidemiological data and may help in further clinical intervention."
