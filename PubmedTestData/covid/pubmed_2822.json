        "Essential workers are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to estimate the yield, acceptability and cost of systematic workplace-based testing of asymptomatic essential workers for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
        "From Jan. 27 to Mar. 12, 2021, we prospectively recruited non-health care essential businesses in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, through email or telephone contact. Two trained mobile teams, each composed of 2 non-health care professionals, visited businesses. Consenting asymptomatic employees provided saline gargle samples under supervision. Samples were analyzed by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At businesses with outbreaks (\u2265 2 participants with a positive result), we retested all participants with a negative result on initial testing. Our primary outcomes were yield (proportion of test results that were positive), acceptability (proportion of participants estimated to be present at the business who agreed to participate) and costs (including training, sample collection and analysis, and communicating results). Our secondary outcome was identification of factors associated with a positive test result on multivariable logistic regression.",
        "Of the 366 businesses contacted, 69 (18.8%) agreed to participate. Nineteen businesses (28%) were manufacturers or suppliers, 12 (17%) were in auto sales or repair, and 11 (16%) were in childcare; the corresponding number of employees was 1225, 242 and 113. The median number of participants per business was 13 (interquartile range [IQR] 8-22). Of an estimated 2348 employees on site, 2128 (90.6%) participated (808 [38.0%] female, median age 48 [IQR 37-57] yr). Of the 2626 tests performed, 53 (2.0%) gave a positive result. Self-reported nonwhite ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-9.9) and a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the study (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) were associated with a positive test result. Five businesses were experiencing an outbreak; at these businesses, 40/917 participants (4.4%) had a positive result on the initial test. We repeated testing for employees with initially negative results at 3 of these businesses over 2-3 weeks: 8/350 participants (2.3%) had a positive result on the second test, and none had a positive result on the third and fourth tests; no employer reported new positive results after our final visit (up to Mar. 26, 2021). At the remaining 64 businesses, 1211 participants were tested once, of whom 5 (0.4%) had a positive result. The per-person RT-PCR cost was $34, and all other costs, $8.67.",
        "On-site saline gargle sampling of essential workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing was acceptable and of modest cost, and appears most useful in the context of outbreaks. This sampling strategy should be evaluated further as a component of efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. PREPRINT: medRxiv - doi:10.1101/2021.05.12.21256956."
