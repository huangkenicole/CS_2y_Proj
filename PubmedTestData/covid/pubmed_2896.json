      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has highlighted the need for rapid assays to accurately measure the infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the effectiveness of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against viral variants. These assays are essential for pandemic surveillance and validating vaccines and variant-specific boosters. This manuscript demonstrates the application of a novel hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Ha-CoV-2) for quick quantification of SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity and vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies to viral variants. Ha-CoV-2 is a SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle consisting of viral structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a fast-expressing RNA genome derived from an alphavirus, Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). Ha-CoV-2 also contains both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase reporter genes that allow for quick quantification of viral infectivity. As an example, the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants are quantified, and their sensitivities to a neutralizing antibody (27VB) are also measured. These examples demonstrate the great potential of Ha-CoV-2 as a robust platform for rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies."
