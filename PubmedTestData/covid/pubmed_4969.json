      "AbstractText": [
        "CoronaVac is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine used in Turkey and approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO). In this study, it was aimed to retrospectively evaluate the mutation status and clinical status in individuals who received two doses of CoronaVac vaccine and were infected with COVID-19 at least two weeks after the second dose.",
        "164 people were included in the study and COVID-19 diagnosis and mutation analyses were determined by RT-PCR using the Bioseepdy SARS CoV-2 Double Gene RT-qPCR Kit and the Biospeedy SARS-CoV-2 Variant Plus kit in accordance with the protocol determined by the manufacturer.",
        "116 (70.7%) UK (Alpha, B.1.1.7) mutation and 3 (1.8%) South Africa (Beta, B.1.351), Brazil (Gamma, P.1) mutations were determined in 164 double doses CoronaVac vaccinated patients; 45 (27.5%) patients were mutation negative. Nine patients (5.5%) developed pneumonia. Eight patients (4.9%) had CT findings compatible with corona virus infection. Seven (4.3%) of the patients received treatment in the intensive care unit, and 5 (3%) of the patients were intubated.",
        "In conclusion, people who receive two doses of CoronaVac vaccine can be reinfected with mutant viruses, vaccine significantly reduces the need for hospitalization, CT findings and intensive care."
