        "<b>Objective:</b> Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been experienced from Wuhan, China to the world. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and to explore the risk factors affecting the disease duration in Jiangan Fangcang shelter hospital, Wuhan, China. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical characteristics of 409 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. We describe the clinical characteristics and distribution of discharge time or transfer time for each patient. Then we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify potential risk factors for progression from non-severe to severe COVID-19 or death. <b>Results:</b> The median disease duration of all patients was 23 days (IQR 19-28). The main symptoms of the patient were fever (95.6%), cough (74.3%), tiredness (21.5%), and so on. Comorbidities mainly included hypertension (30.6%) diabetes (17.6%) and heart disease (12.5%). The univariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age, number of symptoms, the combination of hypertension, heart disease and pulmonary disease were associated with the progression of disease. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age (HR: 7.294; 95% CI: 1.442-36.888; <i>P</i> = 0.016), the combination of hypertension (HR: 2.230; 95% CI: 1.090-4.562; <i>P</i> = 0.028) and heart disease (HR: 2.650; 95% CI: 1.079-6.510; <i>P</i> = 0.034) were independent risk factors for progression of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> The age of the patient, the combination of hypertension and heart disease were independent risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. Cautions should be raised for patients with these risk factors."
