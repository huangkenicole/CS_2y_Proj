        "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has the potential to predict COVID-19 cases; however, reliable methods for tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations (C<sub>RNA</sub>) in wastewater are lacking. In the present study, we developed a highly sensitive method (EPISENS-M) employing adsorption-extraction, followed by one-step RT-Preamp and qPCR. The EPISENS-M allowed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from wastewater at 50\u00a0% detection rate when newly reported COVID-19 cases exceed 0.69/100,000 inhabitants in a sewer catchment. Using the EPISENS-M, a longitudinal WBE study was conducted between 28 May 2020 and 16 June 2022 in Sapporo City, Japan, revealing a strong correlation (Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a00.94) between C<sub>RNA</sub> and the newly COVID-19 cases reported by intensive clinical surveillance. Based on this dataset, a mathematical model was developed based on viral shedding dynamics to estimate the newly reported cases using C<sub>RNA</sub> data and recent clinical data prior to sampling day. This developed model succeeded in predicting the cumulative number of newly reported cases after 5\u00a0days of sampling day within a factor of \u221a2 and 2 with a precision of 36\u00a0% (16/44) and 64\u00a0% (28/44), respectively. By applying this model framework, another estimation mode was developed without the recent clinical data, which successfully predicted the number of COVID-19 cases for the succeeding 5\u00a0days within a factor of \u221a2 and 2 with a precision of 39\u00a0% (17/44) and 66\u00a0% (29/44), respectively. These results demonstrated that the EPISENS-M method combined with the mathematical model can be a powerful tool for predicting COVID-19 cases, especially in the absence of intensive clinical surveillance."
