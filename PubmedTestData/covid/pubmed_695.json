      "AbstractText": [
        "In French Polynesia, following the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in March 2020, several control measures were implemented to prevent virus spread, including a population lockdown and the interruption of international air traffic. SARS-CoV-2 local transmission rapidly stopped, and circulation of dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2, the only arboviruses being detected at that time, decreased. After the borders re-opened, a surveillance strategy consisting of the testing by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of travelers entering French Polynesia, and isolating those with ongoing infection, was implemented. This strategy proved efficient to limit the introduction of SARS-CoV-2, and should be considered to prevent the importation of other pathogens, including mosquito-borne viruses, in geographically isolated areas such as French Polynesia."
