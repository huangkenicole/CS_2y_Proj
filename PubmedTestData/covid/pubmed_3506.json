        "COVID-19 (Virus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-- CoV-2)) is a pandemic disease characterized by respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus. It has spread worldwide after an outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 15 million people globally. The disease severity and mortality increased in patients with heart-related comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease patients are more susceptible and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Early screening and management of these patients prevent or ameliorate adverse outcomes. Several treatments have been used to combat these effects, as previously seen in MERS and SARS. This review will cover the association of cardiovascular diseases with COVID 19. It showed that cardiovascular diseases are common in patients with COVID- 19. Increased attention to highlight the gaps should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients."
