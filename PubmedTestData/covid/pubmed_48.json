        "Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease."
