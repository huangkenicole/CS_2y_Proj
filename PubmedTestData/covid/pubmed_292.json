        "Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highjacks epithelial cells and infiltrates the lung, as well as other organs and tissues, is essential for developing treatment strategies and vaccines against this highly contagious virus. Another major goal is to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV- 2 bypasses the innate immune system and induces a cytokine storm, and its effects on mortality. Currently, SARS- CoV-2 is thought to evade innate antiviral immunity, undergo endocytosis, and fuse with the host cell membrane by exploiting ACE2 receptors and the protease TMMPRSS2, with cathepsin B/L as alternative protease, for entry into the epithelial cells of tissues vulnerable to developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. However, the incorporation of new and unique binding sites, i.e., O-linked glycans, and the preservation and augmentation of effective binding sites (N-linked glycans) on the outer membrane of SARS-CoV-2 may represent other strategies of infecting the human host. Here, I will rationalize the possibility that other host molecules-i.e., sugar molecules and the sialic acidsN-glycolylneuraminic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and their derivates could be viable candidates for the use as virus receptors by SARS-CoV-2 and/or serve as determinants for the adherence on ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2."
