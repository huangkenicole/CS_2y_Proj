        "Currently, the most accurate way to diagnose an active SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is through detection of viral RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. While RT-PCR tests are the most sensitive for identifying infection, there are significant limitations, such as global access to sufficient test kits, turnaround times (TAT) from specimen collection to test result is often greater than 24\u00a0h and the need for skilled operators in accredited laboratories requiring specialized equipment. A rapid test performed at the point of care (POC) could provide a result within an approximate time of 30\u00a0min post specimen collection, be performed by a health care worker and comprise a simple workflow, improving both turnaround time and potentially decreasing costs (e.g., transport, cold-chain, skilled laboratory staff, complex equipment). Determining the performance of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests is, however, easier to assess than antigen-based POCT, as residual clinical specimens (swabs in universal transport media [UTM]) are readily available in laboratory environments, and do not require patient informed consent. Evaluating the performance of POCT requires informed-consent driven studies, with patients required to provide a standard of care specimen as well as study evaluation specimens, which is often not acceptable as nasopharyngeal swabbing can be invasive, clinical field trials are costly and time consuming. Many institutions and regulatory bodies also require preliminary data prior to use in field settings. Therefore, we have developed a method to determine the performance of antigen based POCT that can be used by implementers in national healthcare programs, regulators and rapid test developers. The method investigates both quantitative and qualitative parameters, with the latter providing insights into the capability for implementation and national program uptake."
