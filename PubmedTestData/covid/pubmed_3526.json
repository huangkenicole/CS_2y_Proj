        "The COVID-19 pandemic caused downtrends in both blood collections and blood usage. Rapidly visualizing the impact of the pandemic and newly implemented hospital policies on usage could potentially inform blood ordering practices to help avoid wastage.",
        "Blood usage data were obtained from the laboratory information system. An R-based workflow was written in R Markdown for analysis and visualization. Reports were generated daily and shared with blood bank leadership. Selected reports were shared with institutional leadership, other departments, and collaborating blood suppliers.",
        "Mean daily transfusions dropped 42% from 3/9-13 to 3/16-20, with a significant decrease in usage of red cells, plasma, and cryoprecipitate. The greatest decline in use was seen in the general operating rooms, whereas outpatient transfusions remained steady. Weekly total blood usage decreased through the end of March into April and returned to normal levels in May.",
        "During two 5-weekday periods of changing hospital policies, overall blood usage decreased by almost half. Visualization of usage by hospital location showed a large decrease in general operating room usage after cancellation of elective procedures. This data visualization has informed decisions to modify standing product orders during an initial period of decreased usage as well as return to normal orders in later months."
