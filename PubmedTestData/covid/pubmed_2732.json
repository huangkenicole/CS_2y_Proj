        "To determine anti-SARS-Cov2 antibodies and T-cell immunity in convalescent people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and/or pwMS vaccinated against Covid-19, depending on the disease modifying therapy, and in comparison to healthy controls (HC).",
        "75 participants were enrolled: Group 1-29 (38.7%) COVID-19 convalescent participants; Group 2-34 (45.3%) COVID-19 vaccinated; Group 3-12 (16.0%) COVID-19 convalescent participants who were later vaccinated against COVID-19. Cellular immunity was evaluated by determination of number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells secreting TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and IL2 after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides.",
        "pwMS treated with ocrelizumab were less likely to develop humoral immunity after COVID-19 recovery or vaccination. No difference was observed in the cellular immunity in all studied parameters between pwMS treated with ocrelizumab compared to HC or pwMS who were treatment na\u00efve or on first line therapies. These findings were consistent in convalescent, vaccinated, and convalescent+vaccinated participants. COVID-19 vaccinated convalescent pwMS on ocrelizumab compared to COVID-19 convalescent HC who were vaccinated did not show statistically difference in the rate of seroconversion nor titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",
        "Presence of cellular immunity in pwMS on B-cell depleting therapies is reassuring, as at least partial protection from more severe COVID-19 outcomes can be expected."
