        "For biologic scientists, as for the society in general, the year 2020 was one that few will soon forget. However, in the realm of science, it is possible that it won't be remembered purely, or even mainly, for the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the many discoveries related to its causative agent. Even as non-SARS-related research was brought to a near standstill for much of the year, we may in time come to recognize that revolutionary work in other areas of biology was emerging unnoticed under the shadow of the virus."
