        "The aim of this online workshop is to familiarize biomedical faculties students with the principle of RT-PCR method. The following assumption is made, students participating in the workshop: are already familiar with the principle of PCR reaction, can distinguish PCR from RT-PCR, know the basic possibilities of using the above techniques. During the online workshop participants are supposed to learn the interpretation of PCR and RT-PCR results and to understand the crucial importance of controlling the reaction conditions. The workshop involves active students' learning, critical analysis of the data, group discussion, brainstorming method, involvement of e-tools such as pool everywhere or e-learning platforms, as well as interpreting the real-life example results that allows putting the topic in the proper future work-related tasks. The final part of the workshop focuses on the analysis of the RT-PCR results performed in order to confirm or exclude the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in potentially infected individuals. The students are expected to see the practical/work-related part of the knowledge gained during the workshop."
