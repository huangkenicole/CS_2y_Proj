        "The COVID-19 pandemic is a lethal virus outbreak by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has severely affected human lives and the global economy. The most vital part of the research and development of therapeutic agents is to design drug products to manage COVID-19 efficiently. Numerous attempts have been in place to determine the optimal drug dose and\u00a0combination of drugs\u00a0to treat the disease on a global scale. This article documents the information available on SARS-CoV-2 and its life cycle, which will aid in the development of the potential\u00a0treatment options. A consolidated summary of several natural and repurposed drugs to manage COVID-19 is depicted\u00a0with summary of\u00a0current vaccine development. People with high age, comorbity\u00a0and concomitant illnesses such as overweight, metabolic disorders, pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, renal failure, fatty liver\u00a0and neoplastic disorders are more prone to create serious COVID-19 and its consequences. This article also presents an overview of\u00a0post-COVID-19 complications in patients."
