        "Novel data reveal a causal role for increased BMI in the development of severe COVID-19 (ref.). Solid scientific evidence indicates that there is a linearly increased risk of hospital admission or death due to COVID-19 at a BMI >23\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup>, particularly in younger people. Novel data indicate not only that hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance might drive immunosenescence, but also that hyperinsulinaemia might promote increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated COVID-19 (ref.). Studies indicate that obesity and impaired metabolic health might increase the risk of vaccine-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections<sup>\u2013</sup>."

Novel data indicate that these risk factors might also promote vaccine-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated people. Here, these relationships are discussed and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 that are related to obesity and impaired metabolic health are addressed."
