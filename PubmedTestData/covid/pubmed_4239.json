        "COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the world, affecting a large percentage of the population. When lifting certain mandatory measures for an economic restart, robust surveillance must be established and implemented, with nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 as an essential component.",
        "We tried to develop a one-tube detection platform based on RT-RPA (Reverse Transcription and Recombinase Polymerase Isothermal Amplification) and DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) technology, termed OR-DETECTR, to detect SARS-CoV-2. We designed RT-RPA primers of the RdRp and N genes following the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence. We optimized reaction components so that the detection process could be carried out in one tube. Specificity was demonstrated by detecting nucleic acid samples from pseudoviruses from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1). Clinical samples were used to validate the platform and all results were compared to rRT-PCR. RNA standards and pseudoviruses diluted by different gradients were used to demonstrate the detection limit. Additionally, we have developed a lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR for detecting COVID-19.",
        "The OR-DETECTR detection process can be completed in one tube, which takes approximately 50\u00a0min. This method can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1), with a low detection limit of 2.5 copies/\u00b5l input (RNA standard) and 1 copy/\u00b5l input (pseudovirus). Results of six samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients, eight samples from patients with fever but no SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one mixed sample from 40 negative controls showed that OR-DETECTR is 100% consistent with rRT-PCR. The lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR can be used for the detection of COVID-19, and the detection limit is 2.5 copies/\u00b5l input.",
        "The OR-DETECTR platform for the detection of COVID-19 is rapid, accurate, tube closed, easy-to-operate, and free of large instruments."
