        "The Coronavirus disease with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (COVID-19) and its diverse courses of disease from mild to critical illness frequently is not only an acute disease, but will - in a proportion of those affected - lead to organ structure and body function deficits that still exist or become apparent after the acute stage of disease. When clinically relevant symptoms or functional deficits (impairments) are documented more than four weeks after COVID-19 onset, the syndrome is called \"Long-COVID\", from 12 weeks after onset onwards \"Post-COVID\".In such cases and when everyday life functioning or return to work are affected by persisting deficits specialized rehabilitation treatment is indicated. An individual medical, frequently multi-professional diagnostic evaluation is mandatory in that situation: For adequate treatment, it is important to identify and objectify the individually underlying health conditions based on knowledge about the diverse potential consequences of COVID-19, to assess type and severity of functional consequences (impairments, activity limitations, and restrictions of participation) of Long-/Post-COVID individually, and then to decide on the treatment necessities and plans. With regard to rehabilitation, need and decision for either pulmonary, neurological, cardiac, or psychosomatic rehabilitation depends on the individual medical presentation."
