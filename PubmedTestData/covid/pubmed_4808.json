        "We collected COVID-19 epidemiological and epidemic control measures-related data in mainland China during the period January 1 to February 19, 2020, and empirically tested the practical effects of the epidemic control measures implemented in China by applying the econometrics approach. The results show that nationally, both traffic control and social distancing have played an important role in controlling the outbreak of the epidemic, however, neither of the two measures have had a significant effect in low-risk areas. Moreover, the effect of traffic control is more successful than that of social distancing. Both measures complement each other, and their combined effect achieves even better results. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the measures currently in place in China, however, we would like to emphasize that control measures should be more tailored, which implemented according to each specific city's situation, in order to achieve a better epidemic prevention and control."
