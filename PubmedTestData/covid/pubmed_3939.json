        "Human behaviour, economic activity, vaccination, and social distancing are inseparably entangled in epidemic management. This study aims to investigate the effects of various parameters such as stay-at-home restrictions, work hours, vaccination, and social distance on the containment of pandemics such as COVID-19.",
        "To achieve this, we have developed an agent based model based on a time-dynamic graph with stochastic transmission events. The graph is constructed from a real-world social network. The edges of graph have been categorized into three categories: home, workplaces, and social environment. The conditions needed to mitigate the spread of wild-type COVID-19 and the delta variant have been analyzed. Our purposeful agent based model has carefully executed tens of thousands of individual-based simulations. We propose simple relationships for the trade-offs between effective reproduction number (<i>R</i> <sub>e</sub>), transmission rate, working hours, vaccination, and stay-at-home restrictions.",
        "We have found that the effect of a 13.6% increase in vaccination for wild-type (WT) COVID-19 is equivalent to reducing four hours of work or a one-day stay-at-home restriction. For the delta, 20.2% vaccination has the same effect. Also, since we can keep track of household and non-household infections, we observed that the change in household transmission rate does not significantly alter the <i>R</i> <sub>e</sub>. Household infections are not limited by transmission rate due to the high frequency of connections. For the specifications of COVID-19, the <i>R</i> <sub>e</sub> depends on the non-household transmissions rate.",
        "Our findings highlight that decreasing working hours is the least effective among the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results suggest that policymakers decrease work-related activities as a last resort and should probably not do so when the effects are minimal, as shown. Furthermore, the enforcement of stay-at-home restrictions is moderately effective and can be used in conjunction with other measures if absolutely necessary."
