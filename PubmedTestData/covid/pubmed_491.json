      "AbstractText": [
        "We study geographical epidemic scales and patterns and positivity trends of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics in mass antigen testing in Slovakia in 2020. The observed test positivity was exponentially distributed with a long scale exponential spatial trend, and its characteristic correlation length was approximately 10 km. Spatial scales also play an important role in test positivity reduction between two consecutive testing rounds. While test positivity decreased in all counties, it increased in individual municipalities with low test positivity in the earlier testing round in a way statistically different from a mean-reversion process. Also, non-residents testing influences the mass testing results as test positivity of non-residents was higher than of residents when testing was offered only in municipalities with the highest positivity in previous rounds. Our results provide direct guidance for pandemic geographical data surveillance and epidemic response management."
