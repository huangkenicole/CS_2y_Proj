        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u00a0(SARS-CoV-2) variants and re-emergence of other respiratory viruses highlight the need to understand the presentation of and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric populations over time. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, and epidemiological risk factors associated with ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and determine if factors differ by variant type. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of outpatient children undergoing SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing\u00a0between November 2020 and January 2022. Test-positive were compared with test-negative children to evaluate symptoms, exposure risk, demographics, and comparisons between Omicron, Delta, and pre-Delta time periods. Among 2264 encounters, 361 (15.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The cohort was predominantly Hispanic (51%), 5-11 years (44%), and 53% male; 5% had received two coronavirus disease 2019\u00a0(COVID-19) vaccine doses. Factors associated with a positive test include loss of taste/smell (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.71, [95% confidence interval,\u00a0CI: 2.99-15.08]), new cough (aOR: 2.38, [95%\u00a0CI: 1.69-3.36]), headache (aOR: 1.90, [95% CI: 1.28-2.81), fever (aOR:\u00a01.83, [95%\u00a0CI: 1.29-2.60]), contact with a positive case (aOR: 5.12, [95%\u00a0CI: 3.75-6.97]), or household contact (aOR: 2.66, [95% CI: 1.96-3.62]). Among positive children, loss of taste/smell was more predominant during the Delta versus Omicron and pre-Delta periods (12% vs. 2% and 3%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.0017), cough predominated during Delta/Omicron periods more than the pre-Delta period (69% and 65% vs. 41%, p\u2009=\u20090.0002), and there were more asymptomatic children in the pre-Delta period (30% vs. 18% and 10%, p\u2009=\u20090.0023). These findings demonstrate that the presentation of COVID-19 in children and most susceptible age groups has changed over time."
