      "AbstractText": [
        "To evaluate the impact of testing asymptomatic cancer patients, we analyzed all tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) before and during radiotherapy at a\u00a0tertiary cancer center throughout the second wave of the pandemic in Germany.",
        "Results of all real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV\u20112 performed at our radio-oncology department between 13\u00a0October 2020 and 11\u00a0March 2021 were included. Clinical data and anamnestic information at the time of testing were documented and examined for (i)\u00a0the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and (ii)\u00a0virus-related anamnesis (high-risk [prior positive test or contact to a\u00a0positive tested person within the last 14\u00a0days] or low-risk [inconspicuous anamnesis within the last 14\u00a0days]).",
        "A total of 1056 SARS-CoV\u20112 tests in 543\u00a0patients were analyzed. Of those, 1015 tests were performed in asymptomatic patients and 41\u00a0tests in patients with COVID-19-associated symptoms. Two of 940 (0.2%) tests in asymptomatic patients with low-risk anamnesis and three of 75 (4.0%) tests in asymptomatic patients with high-risk anamnesis showed a\u00a0positive result. For symptomatic patients, SARS-CoV\u20112 was detected in three of 36 (8.3%) low-risk and three of five (60.0%) high-risk tests.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation between individual risk factors and positivity rates of SARS-CoV\u20112 tests in cancer patients. The data demonstrate that clinical and anamnestic assessment is a\u00a0simple and effective measure to distinctly increase SARS-CoV\u20112 test efficiency. This might enable cancer centers to adjust test strategies in asymptomatic patients, especially when test resources are scarce."
