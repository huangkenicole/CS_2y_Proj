        "As a beta-coronavirus, Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused one of the most significant historical pandemics, as well as various health and medical challenges. Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed.",
        "To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection.",
        "SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt.",
        "Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness."
