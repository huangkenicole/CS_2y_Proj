      "AbstractText": [
        "Implementing a specific cloud resource to analyze extensive genomic data on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a challenge when resources are limited. To overcome this, we repurposed a cloud platform initially designed for use in research on cancer genomics (https://cgc.sbgenomics.com) to enable its use in research on SARS-CoV-2 to build Cloud Workflow for Viral and Variant Identification (COWID). COWID is a workflow based on the Common Workflow Language that realizes the full potential of sequencing technology for use in reliable SARS-CoV-2 identification and leverages cloud computing to achieve efficient parallelization. COWID outperformed other contemporary methods for identification by offering scalable identification and reliable variant findings with no false-positive results. COWID typically processed each sample of raw sequencing data within 5\u00a0min at a cost of only US$0.01. The COWID source code is publicly available (https://github.com/hendrick0403/COWID) and can be accessed on any computer with Internet access. COWID is designed to be user-friendly; it can be implemented without prior programming knowledge. Therefore, COWID is a time-efficient tool that can be used during a pandemic."
