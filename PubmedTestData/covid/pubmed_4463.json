        "High antibody titers have been found to correlate with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Therefore, antibody titers may be higher in older adults, whose disease is known to have a more severe course than younger ones. This study aimed to compare the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody level in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test\u00a0positive older adults with young. Patients aged \u226518 with positive RT-PCR and checked serum IgG antibodies between November 1, 2020 and January 13, 2021 were included. The IgG antibody levels and the time between RT-PCR positivity with the antibody levels were recorded. A total of 1071 patients were divided into two groups as Group 1\u2009<60 years old (n\u2009=\u2009902) and\u00a0Group 2\u2009\u226560 years old (n\u2009=\u2009169). The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers were higher in Group 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.001). This height was present in the first 3 months after positive RT-PCR. While the antibody titers were compared by dividing Group 2 into the three groups according to age ranges (60-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years), the antibody titer was higher in \u226580 years patients (p\u2009=\u20090.044). High COVID-19 IgG antibody levels may be associated with the severity of the disease. Also, the humoral immunity advantage was seen in the first 3 months in the older patients, which suggests that older adults with COVID-19 may develop reinfection in the long term."
