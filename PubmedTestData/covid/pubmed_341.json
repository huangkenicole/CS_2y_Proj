        "Although extensive research is being done to combat SARS-CoV-2, we are yet far away from a robust conclusion or strategy. With an increased amount of vaccine research, nanotechnology has found its way into vaccine technology. Researchers have explored the use of various nanostructures for delivering the vaccines for enhanced efficacy. Apart from acting as delivery platforms, multiple studies have shown the application of inorganic nanoparticles in suppressing the growth as well as transmission of the virus. The present review gives a detailed description of various inorganic nanomaterials which are being explored for combating SARS-CoV-2 along with their role in suppressing the transmission of the virus either through air or by contact with inanimate surfaces. The review further discusses the use of nanoparticles for development of an antiviral coating that may decrease adhesion of SARS-CoV-2. A separate section has been included describing the role of nanostructures in biosensing and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The role of nanotechnology in providing an alternative therapeutic platform along with the role of radionuclides in SARS-CoV-2 has been described briefly. Based on ongoing research and commercialization of this nanoplatform for a viral disease, the nanomaterials show the potential in therapy, biosensing, and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2."
