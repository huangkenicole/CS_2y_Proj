        "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has seriously affected public health and social stability. The main route of the transmission is droplet transmission, where the oral cavity is the most important entry point to the body. Due to both the direct harmful effects of SARS-CoV-2 and disordered immune responses, some COVID-19 patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure. Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating around the world. Currently, there is no internationally approved precise treatment for COVID-19. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can traffic and migrate towards the affected tissue, regulate both the innate and acquired immune systems, and participate in the process of healing. Here, we will discuss and investigate the mechanisms of immune disorder in COVID-19 and the therapeutic activity of MSCs, in particular human gingiva mesenchymal stem cells."
