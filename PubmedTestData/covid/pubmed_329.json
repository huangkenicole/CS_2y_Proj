        "Globally, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as threat to life and economy. Researchers are trying to find a cure against this pathogen but without much success. Several attempts have been made to understand the atomic level details of SARS-CoV-2 in the past few months. However, one review with all structural details for drug and vaccine development has been missing. Hence, this review aims to summarize key functional roles played by various domains of SARS-CoV-2 genome during its entry into the host, replication, repression of host immune response and overall viral life cycle. Additionally, various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for finding a potent inhibitor have also been highlighted. To mitigate this deadly virus, an understanding of atomic level information, pathogenicity mechanisms and functions of different proteins in causing the infection is imperative. Thus, these structural details would finally pave the way for development of a potential drug/vaccine against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2."
