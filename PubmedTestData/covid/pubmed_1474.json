        "While the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continuing, it may become worse in the coming winter months with a high potential for the emergence and spread of escape variants of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) from bats may also cause outbreaks of emerging coronavirus diseases in the future. These predictions call for the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging coronavirus disease epidemics. In this review, we describe advances and challenges in the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against lineage B betacoronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV-Bs), including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and SARSr-CoVs, as well as peptide-based pan-CoV fusion inhibitors and their potential in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections."
