        "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among children and adolescents against SARS-CoV-2 variants. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies published on or before June 20, 2023. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents (\u2264\u200918\u00a0years of age) were included. Data extraction, quality assessment, and analysis were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Ten studies were included, comprising five cohort studies (527,778 participants) and four case-control studies (1,477,422 participants). The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 variants was 68% (95% CI\u2009=\u200960-74%). In terms of age, the VE was higher in adolescents aged 12-18\u00a0years [69%(95% CI\u2009=\u200961-75%)] than in children aged 5-11\u00a0years [44%(95% CI\u2009=\u20091-68%)]. \"Fully vaccinated\" may offer greater protection than \"partially vaccinated,\" with a VE of 71% (95%CI\u2009=\u200959-79%) and 66% (95%CI\u2009=\u200951-76%), respectively. \u00a0 \u00a0Conclusion: This meta-analysis presents moderate-quality evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine is effective in safeguarding children and adolescents from the SARS-CoV-2 variant. Being fully vaccinated may offer greater protection than being partially vaccinated. Nevertheless, additional high-quality controlled trials are required to verify this finding. What is Known: \u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines worldwide. Children and adolescents are a unique population for vaccination, and the effectiveness of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants in this age group is of concern. What is New: \u2022 The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in protecting children and adolescents against the SARS-CoV-2 variant. Being fully vaccinated may offer greater protection than being partially vaccinated."
