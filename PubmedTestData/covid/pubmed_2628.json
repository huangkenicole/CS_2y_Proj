        "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the greatest current threat to global public health. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1\u03b1 is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1\u03b1 are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called \"hypoxic conditioning\" to activate HIF-1\u03b1-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, we would propose further investigations into the hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms, from which novel targeted therapies can be developed for the improved management of COVID-19."
