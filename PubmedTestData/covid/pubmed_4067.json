      "AbstractText": [
        "The world is now apparently at the last/recovery stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, starting from 29 December 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the progression of time, several mutations have taken place in the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, which have generated variants of concern (VOC). Therefore, combatting COVID-19 has required the development of COVID-19 vaccines using several platforms. The immunity induced by those vaccines is vital to study in order to assure total protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. Indeed, understanding and identifying COVID-19 protection mechanisms or the host immune responses are of significance in terms of designing both new and repurposed drugs as well as the development of novel vaccines with few to no side effects. Detecting the immune mechanisms for host protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is crucial for the development of novel COVID-19 vaccines as well as to monitor the effectiveness of the currently used vaccines worldwide. Immune memory in terms of the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) during reinfection is also very crucial to formulate the vaccine administration schedule/vaccine doses. The response of antigen-specific antibodies and NAbs as well as T cell responses, along with the protective cytokine production and the innate immunity generated upon COVID-19 vaccination, are discussed in the current review in comparison to the features of naturally induced protective immunity."
