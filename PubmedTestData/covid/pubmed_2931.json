      "AbstractText": [
        "At present, the RT-PCR test remains the gold standard for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence demonstrating that this technique may generate false-negative results. Here, we aimed to compare the new mass spectrometry-based assay MassARRAY<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 Panel with the RT-PCR diagnostic test approved for clinical use. The study group consisted of 168 suspected patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection. After simultaneous analysis by RT-PCR and mass spectrometry methods, we obtained discordant results for 17 samples (10.12%). Within fifteen samples officially reported as presumptive positive, 13 were positive according to the MS-based assay. Moreover, four samples reported by the officially approved RT-PCR as negative were positive in at least one MS assay. We have successfully demonstrated superior sensitivity of the MS-based assay in SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing that MALDI-TOF MS seems to be ideal for the detection as well as discrimination of mutations within the viral genome."
