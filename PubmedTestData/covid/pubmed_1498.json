      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in the death of over 18\u2005000 Canadians and has impacted the lives of all Canadians. Many Canadian research groups have expanded their research programs to include COVID-19. Over the past year, our knowledge of this novel disease has grown and has led to the initiation of a number of clinical vaccine and drug trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we review SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) and the natural history of COVID-19, including a timeline of disease progression after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We also review the pathophysiological effects of COVID-19 on the organ systems that have been implicated in the disease, including the lungs, upper respiratory tract, immune system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal organs, the liver, and the kidneys. Then we review general therapeutics strategies that are being applied and investigated for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19, including vaccines, antivirals, immune system enhancers, pulmonary supportive agents, immunosuppressants and (or) anti-inflammatories, and cardiovascular system regulators. Finally, we provide an overview of all current Health Canada authorized clinical drug and vaccine trials for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19."
