      "AbstractText": [
        "Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and, therefore, is the \"gold standard\" diagnostic method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to compare and analyze the detection performance of three different commercially available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits: Sansure Biotech, GeneFinder<sup>TM</sup>, and TaqPath<sup>TM</sup> on 354 randomly selected samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All PCR reactions were performed using the same RNA isolates and one real-time PCR machine. The final result of the three evaluated kits was not statistically different (<i>p</i> = 0.107), and also had a strong positive association and high Cohen's \u03ba coefficient. In contrast, the average Ct values that refer to the ORF1ab and N gene amplification were significantly different (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively), with the lowest obtained by the TaqPath<sup>TM</sup> for the ORF1ab and by the Sansure Biotech for the N gene. The results show a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of the three assays is comparable. However, the SanSure Biotech kit showed a bit better diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the imperative for improvement should address the determination of cut-off Ct values and rapid modification of the primer sets along with the appearance of new variants."
