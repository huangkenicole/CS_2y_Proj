        "With the increasing number of immunoinflammatory complexities, cancer patients have a higher risk of serious disease outcomes and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection which is still not clear. In this study, we aimed to identify infectome, diseasome and comorbidities between COVID-19 and cancer via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to identify the synergistic severity of the cancer patient for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized transcriptomic datasets of SARS-CoV-2 and different cancers from Gene Expression Omnibus and Array Express Database to develop a bioinformatics pipeline and software tools to analyze a large set of transcriptomic data and identify the pathobiological relationships between the disease conditions. Our bioinformatics approach revealed commonly dysregulated genes (MARCO, VCAN, ACTB, LGALS1, HMOX1, TIMP1, OAS2, GAPDH, MSH3, FN1, NPC2, JUND, CHI3L1, GPNMB, SYTL2, CASP1, S100A8, MYO10, IGFBP3, APCDD1, COL6A3, FABP5, PRDX3, CLEC1B, DDIT4, CXCL10 and CXCL8), common gene ontology (GO), molecular pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infections and cancers. This work also shows the synergistic complexities of SARS-CoV-2 infections for cancer patients through the gene set enrichment and semantic similarity. These results highlighted the immune systems, cell activation and cytokine production GO pathways that were observed in SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as breast, lungs, colon, kidney and thyroid cancers. This work also revealed ribosome biogenesis, wnt signaling pathway, ribosome, chemokine and cytokine pathways that are commonly deregulated in cancers and COVID-19. Thus, our bioinformatics approach and tools revealed interconnections in terms of significant genes, GO, pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infections and malignant tumors."
