        "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started more than 3 years ago, but the containment of the spread is still a challenge. Screening is imperative for informed decision making by government authorities to contain the spread of the virus locally. The access to screening tests is disproportional, due to the lack of access to reagents, equipment, finances or because of supply chain disruptions. Low and middle-income countries have especially suffered with the lack of these resources. Here, we propose a low cost and easily constructed biosensor device based on localized surface plasmon resonance, or LSPR, for the screening of SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor device, dubbed \"sensor\" for simplicity, was constructed in two modalities: (1) viral detection in saliva and (2) antibody against COVID in saliva. Saliva collected from 18 patients were tested in triplicates. Both sensors successfully classified all COVID positive patients (among hospitalized and non-hospitalized). From the COVID negative patients 7/8 patients were correctly classified. For both sensors, sensitivity was determined as 100% (95% CI 79.5-100) and specificity as 87.5% (95% CI 80.5-100). The reagents and equipment used for the construction and deployment of this sensor are ubiquitous and low-cost. This sensor technology can then add to the potential solution for challenges related to screening tests in underserved communities."
