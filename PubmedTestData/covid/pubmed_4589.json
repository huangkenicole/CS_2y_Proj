      "AbstractText": [
        "Most rhinologic procedures, particularly endoscopic sinonasal procedures, are liable to produce aerosols. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co V-2) transmits via respiratory droplets, but the degree of its spread through airborne routes by aerosol is unclear.",
        "The aim of this article is to counsel rhinologists on how to modify their conventional practice during the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritising the need of procedures, identifying aerosol- generating procedures and using precise personal protection equipment for various endonasal procedures.",
        "We did a review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed, ENT Cochrane, DOAJ and Web of Science databases using the keywords nasal endoscopy, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, aerosol generating medical procedures and rhinology to formulate guidelines for the safety of healthcare workers.",
        "The review included evidence from 28 articles from the otorhinolaryngology, surgery, infectious disease, head and neck surgery and cancer biology literature. We have provided recommendations and relevant information for rhinologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the available studies and data, to warrant high-quality patient care and requisite levels of infection prevention during rhinology procedures.",
        "In rhinology, marked care is advised during nasal packing, electrocauterisation and use of high-speed rotating devices in potentially infected tissue as they are considerable aerosol- producing procedures. The choice of personal protective equipment is based on the risk of exposure and possible modes of aerosol generation."
