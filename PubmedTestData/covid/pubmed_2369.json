        "Bat coronaviruses (CoVs) are extremely prevalent throughout the globe and exhibit a wide range of genetic diversity. Currently, little is known about the susceptibility of New World bats to severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. Also, there is limited information about the genetic diversity of other CoVs in the New World bats. The determination of genetic diversity of bat CoVs through continuous surveillance is essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of new CoVs and their impacts on the health of both humans and animals. In this study, 491 guano specimens collected from New World bats and 37 specimens collected from Old World bats during July 2020 to July 2021 were tested for SARS-COV-2 and other CoVs using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) panel and pan-coronavirus PCR that target a highly conserved region of CoVs. No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found in the tested specimens. An alpha CoV was detected in a single specimen from a big brown bat (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>). This information was used by wildlife agencies and rehabilitation facilities to permit the release of bats during the pandemic while mitigating the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 among North American bats and other wild animal populations."
