        "This systematic review is conducted to explore available information on clinical presentations, laboratory finding and outcomes of SARS-COV-2 in liver transplant patients.",
        "We searched four databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and liver transplantation and collected both case reports and case series on liver transplantation published up to the end of September 2020.",
        "After initial screening of irrelevant articles, 25 studies were included and analyzed in this review. Among the 59 patients included, 78.3% were over 50 years old, and 71.6% were males. The majority of patients (93.3%) were hospitalized. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (72.9%) followed by dyspnea and cough (54.2%). The majority of patients revealed a high level of CRP (64.3%). Moreover, high level ALT, AST and ALP were reported in 64.3, 37.5, 30.5 and 22.2% of patients. A total, 9(15.3%), of cases died as a result of complications of COVID-19. Chest radiographs were reported in 72.9%(43/59) of cases that 94% demonstrated radiologic evidence of abnormality.",
        "The results demonstrated that the most prevalent symptoms and signs were fever, dyspnea and cough. Moreover, most patients were males and hospitalized. The rate of mortality and high level of CRP, ALT/AST and ALP is similar within the non-immune suppressed and general population. However, early detection of high level of serum CRP, ALT/AST and ALP combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom and finding of CT scan may be used as an index for the presence and severity of the disease."
