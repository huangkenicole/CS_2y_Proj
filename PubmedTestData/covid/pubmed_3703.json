        "COVID-19 infection can cause damage to various systems, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological, both during the course of the disease and in the period after recovery, caused by the effects of so-called \"Long COVID.\" Cardiovascular complications caused by COVID-19 infection are not yet fully understood and characterized. Cardiovascular complications caused by COVID-19 include pericarditis, myocarditis, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, and thromboembolic disease. The pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 are still being studied. More severe COVID-19 cases with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) have frequent involvement of cardiovascular damage. In addition, recent evidence shows that months later, individuals who have had a COVID-19 infection may be at a greater risk of suffering heart disease than individuals who have not had the infection. In this brief literature review, we summarize the current evidence in the literature on cardiovascular damage caused by COVID-19, during the period of infection and in the long COVID, and possible concomitant risk factors, which may play an important role."
