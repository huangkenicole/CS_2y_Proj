        "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 seem to show reduced clinical severity compared with earlier variants. Therefore, we aimed to assess and classify the cause of hospitalization for patients with COVID-19 identified with these Omicron variants in our hospital.",
        "A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients identified with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant between December 23, 2021, and February 27, 2022. Patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) upon clinical admission or during clinical admission were classified into four categories: (1) primary COVID-19, (2) admission-contributing COVID-19, (3) incidental COVID-19, and (4) undetermined COVID-19.",
        "We classified 172 COVID-19 Omicron patient admissions, including 151 adult and 21 pediatric patients. Of the adult patients, 45% were primary COVID-19 cases, 21% were admission-contributing, 31% were incidental, and 3% were undetermined. Of the pediatric patients, 19% were primary COVID-19 cases, 29% were admission-contributing, 38% were incidental, and 14% were undetermined.",
        "In the evolving landscape of COVID-19, the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. The different patient categories should be considered in public health policy decision-making and when informing the general public."
