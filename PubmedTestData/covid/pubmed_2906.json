      "AbstractText": [
        "The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, has led to more than 170 million confirmed cases in 223 countries and regions, claiming 3,872,457 lives. Some patients with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms despite severe respiratory failure, which greatly increases the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment. It is therefore necessary to identify biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, screen novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as to explore potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the current published literature on COVID-19. We find that the comprehensive application of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of COVID-19. Multi-omics analysis platforms are expected to revolutionize the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. This review aims to provide a reference for diagnosis, surveillance and clinical decision making related to COVID-19."
