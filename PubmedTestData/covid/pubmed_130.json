        "<b>Introduction:</b> Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major pandemic and continuously emerging due to unclear prognosis and unavailability of reliable detection tools. Older adults are more susceptible to COVID-19 than children showing mature Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), low concentration of immune targets, and comorbid conditions. Several detection platforms have been commercialized to date and more are in pipeline, however, the rate of false-positive results and rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is increasing. Additionally, physiological, and geographical variations of affected individuals are also calling for diagnostic methods optimization.<b>Areas Covered:</b> Extensive information related to the optimization and usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods based on sensitivity and specificity as definitive and feasible investigative tools is discussed. Moreover, an option of combining laboratory diagnostic methods to improve diagnostic strategies is also proposed and discussed in the comparative section of optimization studies.<b>Expert Opinion:</b> The review article explains the importance of optimization strategies for SARS-CoV-2 detection in children and older adults. There are advancements in COVID-19 detection\u00a0including CRISPR-based, electrochemical, and optical-based sensing systems. However, the lack of sufficient studies on a comparative evaluation of standardized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods among children and older adults, limit the authentication of commercialized kits."
