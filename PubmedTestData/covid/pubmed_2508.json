        "SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing major havoc worldwide with its efficient transmission and propagation. To track the emergence as well as the persistence of mutations during the early stage of the pandemic, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole proteome sequences has been performed by considering manually curated 31,389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the 7 highly recurring (percentage frequency\u226510%) mutations (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp6:L37F, Nsp12:P323L, Spike:D614G, ORF3a:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R), N protein:R203K and N protein: G204R are co-occurring (dependent) mutations. Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G often appear simultaneously. The highly recurring Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L and Nsp6:L37F as well as moderately recurring (percentage frequency between \u22651 and <10%) ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S mutations have led to4 major clades in addition to a clade that lacks high recurring mutations. Further, the occurrence of ORF3a:Q57H&Nsp2:T85I, ORF3a:Q57H and N protein:R203K&G204R along with Nsp12:P323L&Spike:D614G has led to 3 additional sub-clades. Similarly, occurrence of Nsp6:L37F and ORF3a:G251V together has led to the emergence of a sub-clade. Nonetheless, ORF8:L84S does not occur along with ORF3a:G251V or Nsp6:L37F. Intriguingly, ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S are found to occur independent of Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G mutations. These clades have evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and have disseminated across several countries. Further, Nsp10 is found to be highly resistant to mutations, thus, it can be exploited for drug/vaccine development and the corresponding gene sequence can be used for the diagnosis. Concisely, the study reports the SARS-CoV-2 antigens diversity across the globe during the early stage of the pandemic and facilitates the understanding of viral evolution."
