        "The studies to prevent the Corona virus, which is a huge epidemic nowadays and causes the death of many people, are of great importance. Drugs to be developed to prevent the proliferation and spread of it. The active substances of the drugs have been used to prevent the attack of the COVID-19. The natural phytochemicals obtained from the traditional medicine play a big role in the inhibition of functional structures in many harmful microscopic structures.",
        "The active role of the substances for protecting from the attack of COVID-19 have been calculated and determined by using docking.",
        "It has been clarified that drug active substances inhibit COVID-19. The selected active ingredients seem to have considerable inhibition effects for COVID-19. Molecular mechanical Poisson-Boltzman (MM-PSBA) calculations were used to analyse the selected molecules.",
        "This study is the first in terms of reducing the harmful effect of COVID-19 by providing effective results in a short time by guiding the experimental studies to reveal the inhibitory effect of COVID-19 (Tab. 3, Fig. 5, Ref. 25).
