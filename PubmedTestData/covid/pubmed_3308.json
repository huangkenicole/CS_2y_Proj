        "Data regarding the immunological memory and long-time kinetics of immunoglobulin (IgG) against viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein S1 receptor-binding domain (S1RBD) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are lacking.\u00a0All consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our Clinic between March 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020, who were tested at hospital admission for anti-S1RBD and anti-NP IgG were\u00a0enrolled. Serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the use of two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent\u00a0assays. Results are expressed as optical density measurements at 450\u2009nm (OD<sub>450</sub> ).\u00a0Overall, 111 patients were included; the median (q1-q3) age was 57 (49-73) years, 59 (53%) males. According to disease severity, 31 (28%), 47 (42%), and 33 (30%) patients were considered affected by mild/moderate, severe, and critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. During hospitalization, patients with the critical disease showed a higher peak value of both anti-NP (median OD<sub>450</sub> : 3.66 vs. 3.06 vs. 3.00 respectively, p\u2009=\u2009.043) and anti-S1RBD IgG (median OD<sub>450</sub> : 2.33 vs. 1.6 vs. 0.91, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.001). By testing 48 subjects\u00a06 months or above from discharge, a significant decrease of anti-NP IgG was observed (r: -0.5838; p\u2009<\u2009.0001), whereas anti-S1RBD IgG showed only a modest reduction (r: -0.1507; p\u2009=\u2009.0647). Accordingly, 10 (21%) and 2 (4%) patients had a negative serological status for anti-NP and anti-S1RBD IgG, respectively; no association with clinical severity was found.\u00a0IgGs against SARS-CoV-2 persisted several months after discharge, regardless of disease severity, suggesting that vaccination could be a valid strategy to fight the pandemic."
