      "AbstractText": [
        "Early confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is a key point in the timely management of infected patients and contact persons. Routine diagnostics of COVID-19 cases relies on RT-PCR detection of two or three unique sequences of the virus. A serious problem for the laboratories is how to interpret inconclusive samples which are positive for only one of the SARS-CoV-2 specific genes.",
        "A total of 16364 naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested with SARS-CoV-2 Real-TM kit (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy) between May and September 2020. We retrospectively analyzed their amplification plots to determine the number of inconclusive samples. We also reviewed the medical records to summarize the patient's COVID-19 testing history and basic demographic characteristics.",
        "We obtained 136 (0.8%) inconclusive samples with amplification signal only for the N-gene. Thirty-nine of the samples were excluded from further analysis as no additional data were available for them. Of the rest of the samples, the majority- 48% (95% CI 38-59%) had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, 14% (95% CI 8-23%)-a subsequent history of positivity and 37% (95% CI 28-48%) were considered as false positive.",
        "A substantial proportion of the inconclusive results should be considered as positive samples at the beginning or the end of the infection. However, the number of false-positive results is also significant and each patient's result should be analyzed separately following the clinical symptoms and epidemiological data."
