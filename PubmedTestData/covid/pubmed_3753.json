        "Coronaviruses and influenza viruses have similarities and differences. In order to comprehensively compare them, their genome sequencing data were examined by principal component analysis. Coronaviruses had fewer variations than a subclass of influenza viruses. In addition, differences among coronaviruses that infect a variety of hosts were also small. These characteristics may have facilitated the infection of different hosts. Although many of the coronaviruses were conservative, those repeatedly found among humans showed annual changes. If SARS-CoV-2 changes its genome like the Influenza H type, it will repeatedly spread every few years. In addition, the coronavirus family has many other candidates for new pandemics."
