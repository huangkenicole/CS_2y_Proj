        "The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 dominated the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high viral replication capacity and immune evasion, causing massive outbreaks of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Currently, variant identification is performed mainly by sequencing. However, the high requirements for equipment and operators as well as its high cost have limited its application in underdeveloped regions. To achieve an economical and rapid method of variant identification suitable for undeveloped areas, we applied an amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) based on PCR for the detection of novel coronavirus variants. The results showed that this method could be finished in 90\u00a0min and detect as few as 500 copies/mL and not react with SARS-Coronavirus, influenza <i>A H1N1(2009)</i>, and other cross-pathogens or be influenced by fresh human blood, \u03b1- interferon, and other interfering substances. In a set of double-blind trials, tests of 262 samples obtained from patients confirmed with Delta variant infection revealed that our method was able to accurately identify the Delta variant with high sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, the ARMS-PCR method applied in Delta variant identification is rapid, sensitive, specific, economical, and suitable for undeveloped areas. In our future study, ARMS-PCR will be further applied in the identification of other variants, such as Omicron."
