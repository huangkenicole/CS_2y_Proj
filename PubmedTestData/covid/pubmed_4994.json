        "Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). The disease resulted in global morbidity and mortality that led to considering as pandemic. The human body response to COVID-19 infection was massively different from being asymptomatic to developing severe symptoms. Host genetic factors are thought to be one of the reasons for these disparities in body responses. Few studies have suggested that Apolipoprotein Epsilon (Apo E) is a candidate gene for playing roles in the development of the disease symptoms. This work aims to find an association between different Apo E genotypes and alleles to COVID-19 infection comparing a general population and a group of COVID-19 patients. For the first time, the results found that Apo E4 is associated with COVID-19 disease in a Kurdish population of Iraq. Further study is required to reveal this association in different ethnic backgrounds all over the world."
