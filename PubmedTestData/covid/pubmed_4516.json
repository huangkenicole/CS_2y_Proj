        "The Omicron variant differs from earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the way it enters host cells and grows <i>in vitro</i>. We therefore reevaluated its diagnosis using saliva, nasopharyngeal swab (NPs), and anterior nasal swab (ANs) specimens from 202 individuals (64.9% symptomatic) tested at the Toulouse University Hospital SARS-CoV-2 drive-through testing center. All tests were done with the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit. Overall, 92 subjects (45.5%) had one or more positive specimens. Global sensitivities of saliva, NPs, and ANs were 94.6%, 90.2%, and 82.6%, respectively. Saliva provided significantly greater sensitivity among symptomatic patients tested within 5\u2009days of symptom onset (100%) than did ANs (83.1%) or NPs (89.8%). We obtained follow-up samples for 7/20 individuals with discordant results. Among them, 5 symptomatic patients were diagnosed positive on saliva sample only, soon after symptom onset; NPs and ANs became positive only later. Thus, saliva samples are effective tools for the detection of the Omicron variant. In addition to its many advantages, such as improved patient acceptance and reduced cost, saliva sampling could help limit viral spread through earlier viral detection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of the global strategy for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, numerous studies have evaluated the diagnostic sensitivity of different respiratory and oral specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The pandemic has been since dominated by the emergence of new variants, the latest being the Omicron variant characterized by numerous mutations and changes in host tropism <i>in vitro</i> that might affect the diagnostic performance of tests depending on the sampling location. In this prospective study, we evaluated the clinical performance of NPs, ANs, and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis during the Omicron wave. Our results highlight the effectiveness of saliva-based RT-PCR for the early detection of the Omicron variant. These findings may help to refine guidelines and support the use of a highly sensitive diagnostic method that allows earlier diagnosis, when transmission is the most critical."
