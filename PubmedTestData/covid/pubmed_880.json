        "After the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 and the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections all over the world, researchers are struggling to investigate effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this infection. Targeting viral small molecules that are involved in the process of infection is a promising strategy. Since many host factors are also used by SARS-CoV-2 during various stages of infection, down-regulating or silencing these factors can serve as an effective therapeutic tool. Several nucleic acid-based technologies including short interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, DNAzymes, and ribozymes have been suggested for the control of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other respiratory viruses. The antisense technology also plays an indispensable role in the treatment of many other diseases including cancer, influenza, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In this review, we summarised the potential applications of antisense technology for the treatment of coronaviruses and specifically COVID-19 infection."
