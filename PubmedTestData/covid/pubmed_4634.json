        "There is an urgent need for new animal models of SARS CoV-2 infection to improve research and drug development. This brief commentary examines the deficits of current models and proposes several improved alternates. The existing single transgene mouse models poorly mimic the clinical features of COVID-19; those strains get a milder disease than human COVID-19 disease. Many of the current transgenic models utilize random integration of several copies of single ACE2 transgenes, resulting in unnatural gene expression and exhibit rapid lethality. We suggest preparing precision knock-in of selected human mini genes at the mouse initiation codon and knock-out of the mouse homolog as a better option. Three genes critical for infection are suggested targets, ACE2 (the viral cellular receptor), its co-infection protease TMRPSS2, and the primary antibody clearance receptor Fc\u03b3RT. To offer the best platform for COVID 19 research, preparation of single, double, and triple humanized combinations offers the researcher the opportunity to better understand the contributions of these receptors, coreceptors to therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we propose to create the humanized strains in the C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2 responders, respectively, and allow modeling of the variability seen in human pathology including lung pathology and late sequelae of COVID-19 disease (BALB/c). We suggest the need to do a thorough characterization of both the short-term and long-term effects of SAR-CoV-2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, hematologic, and immunologic levels. We expect the multiply humanized strains will be superior to the single-gene and multiple-gene-copy transgenic models available to date. These mouse models will represent state-of-the-art tools for investigating mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity and developing vaccines and drugs."
