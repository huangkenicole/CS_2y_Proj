      "AbstractText": [
        "Since the COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019, there have been several reports of patients succumbing to neurological complications. Early reports were suggestive of a possibility, while by early 2020 it was clearly evident that although SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system, the brain is one of the most affected organs post-recovery. Although it may be premature to comment on the long-term effects of COVID-19 in brain, some reliable predictions can be made based on the data currently available. Further, exploring the CNS connections of SARS-CoV-2 is of keen interest for neuroscience researchers. As soon as the virus enters the nasal region, it is exposed to the olfactory nervous system which is interlinked with the visual system, and hence we explore the mechanism of entry of this virus into CNS, including brain, olfactory and retinal nervous systems. In this review, we have thoroughly reviewed reports about both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with respect to their ability to breach the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers. We have compiled different neurological conditions resulting from COVID-19 and looked into viral infections related to COVID-19 to understand how the virus may gain control of the olfactory and visual systems. Once the dust settles on the pandemic, it would be interesting to explore the extent of viral infection in the CNS. The longterm effects of this virus in the CNS are not yet known, and several scientific research papers evolving in this field will throw light on the same."
