      "AbstractText": [
        "Since the initial reports of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unidentified origin in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus that causes this disease - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has spread throughout the world, igniting the twenty-first century's deadliest pandemic. Over the past 12 months, a dizzying array of information has emerged from numerous laboratories, covering everything from the putative origin of SARS-CoV-2 to the development of numerous candidate vaccines. Many immunologists quickly pivoted from their existing research to focus on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and, owing to this unprecedented convergence of efforts on one viral infection, a remarkable body of work has been produced and disseminated, through both preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. Here, we take readers through the timeline of key discoveries during the first year of the pandemic, which showcases the extraordinary leaps in our understanding of the\u00a0immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and highlights gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future investigations."

  "CoiStatement": "The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, naming F.K. as co-inventor. The authors would also like to note the following, which could be perceived as a conflict of interest for F.K.: he has previously published work on influenza virus vaccines with S. Gilbert (University of Oxford), has consulted for Curevac, Merck and Pfizer (before 2020), is currently consulting for Avimex (Mexico) and Seqirus (Australia), his laboratory is collaborating with Pfizer on animal models of SARS-CoV-2, his laboratory is collaborating with N. Pardi at the University of Pennsylvania on mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, his laboratory was working in the past with GlaxoSmithKline on the development of influenza virus vaccines, and two of his mentees have recently joined Moderna. A.I. served as a consultant for Adaptive Biotechnologies. T.C. declares no competing interests."
