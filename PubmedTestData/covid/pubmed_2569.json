        "Faced with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), high-throughput respiratory tests are in high demand. We evaluated the clinical performance of the\u00a0GSD NovaPrime\u00ae\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 RTq-PCR assay, a new assay that detects\u00a02 specific RNA sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. It was assessed using 99 nasopharyngeal samples and compared in parallel with the Allplex\u00ae assay. Among those samples, 72 and 27 were included in the positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement analyses, respectively. In case of discordance, samples were reanalyzed with another amplification technique, the Aptima\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay. Cross-reactivity, including specimens positive for another respiratory virus and collected before the COVID-19 outbreak, was also evaluated (n\u00a0=\u00a032). Based on the patients' clinical history, the Ct (cycle threshold) values obtained, and the results of the Aptima\u00ae assay, the clinical performances were deemed satisfactory, with the PPA reaching a minimum percentage of 87.5% and the NPA reaching 100%. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was observed."
