        "Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infections are driven by the emergence of various variants, with differential propensities to escape immune containment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RNA genome result in altered protein structures and when these changes occur in the <i>S</i>-gene, encoding the spike protein, the ability of the virus to penetrate host cells to initiate an infection can be significantly altered. As a result, vaccine efficacy and prior immunity may be diminished, potentially leading to new waves of infection. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants using a rapid and scalable approach will be paramount for continued monitoring of new infections. In this study, we developed minor groove-binding (MGB) probe-based qPCR assays targeted to specific SNPs in the <i>S</i>-gene, which are present in variants of concern (VOC), namely the E484K, N501Y, G446S and D405N mutations. A total of 95 archived SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens collected in Johannesburg, South Africa between February 2021 and March 2022 were assessed using these qPCR assays. To independently confirm SNP detection, Sanger sequencing of the relevant region in the <i>S</i>-gene were performed. Where a PCR product could be generated and sequenced, qPCR assays were 100% concordant highlighting the robustness of the approach. These assays, and the approach described, offer the opportunity for easy detection and scaling of targeted detection of variant-defining SNPs in the clinical setting."
