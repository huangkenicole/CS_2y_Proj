      "AbstractText": [
        "Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) has triggered pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute infectious respiratory disease that first became epidemic in Wuhan (China) and is now spreading worldwide. Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are very similar viruses genomically and structurally, the huge number of severe cases and deaths now being caused by 2019-nCoV infections has understandably prompted intense research on the receptor used by it to enter human cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, now appears likely to mediate 2019-nCoV entry into human cells. In this review, we describe the roles performed by ACE2 as an enzymatic catalyst and as a receptor for this novel coronavirus. We also summarize the latest research pertaining to the changes noted in ACE2 expression after viral binding, and the relationships relating to virus transmission and population susceptibility to it. Lastly, we speculate on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and provide a useful reference for drug development against this aggressive virus."
