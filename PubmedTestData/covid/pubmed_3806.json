        "To describe the factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mild-to-moderate patients attending for assessment. This observational study was conducted in a Model 4 tertiary referral center in Ireland. All patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 assessment over a 4-week period were included. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, and mortality) were collected. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were assessed. These patients were predominantly female (62%) with a median age of 50\u2009years (SD 16.9). Nineteen (6.8%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 detected. Dysgeusia was associated with a 16-fold increased prediction of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p\u2009=\u2009.001; OR, 16.8; 95% CI, 3.82-73.84). Thirteen patients with SARS-COV-2 detected (68.4%) were admitted, in contrast with 38.1% (99/260) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 non-detectable or not tested (p\u2009=\u2009.001). Female patients were more likely to be hospitalized (p\u2009=\u2009.01) as were current and ex-smokers (p\u2009=\u2009.05). We describe olfactory disturbance and fever as the main presenting features in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients are more likely to be hospitalized with increased length of stay; however, they make up a minority of the patients assessed. \"Non-detectable\" patients remain likely to require prolonged hospitalization. Knowledge of predictors of hospitalization in a \"non-detectable\" cohort will aid future planning and discussion of patient assessment in a SARS-CoV-2 era."
