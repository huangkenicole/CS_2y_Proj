        "Patients with hematological malignancies with immunodeficiency are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrospective summarized clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients with hematological malignancies, shared treatment experiences, and analysis prognostic factors. Fourteen patients were enrolled. The median duration of viral shedding was 27.5\u2009days in survivors. The median duration of time to death was 13\u2009days in non-survivors. Non-survivors tend to present lower neutrophil count, more imaging finding of bilateral diffuse patch opacities, more undergoing intensive chemotherapy or immunosuppression. Laboratory and image findings were atypical and diverse. COVID-19 inpatients undergoing intensive chemotherapy or immunosuppression might have increased risk of death. The diagnostic value of specific antibody detection is limited. Therefore, adult COVID-19 inpatients with hematological malignancies present atypical, severe symptoms, decreased virus clearance ability, abnormal antibody response and poor outcome. During the epidemic, the pros and cons need to be carefully weighed while selecting the treatment methods."
