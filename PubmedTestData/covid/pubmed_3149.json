        "COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused an ongoing global pandemic with economic and social disruption. Moreover, the virus has persistently and rapidly evolved into novel lineages with mutations. The most effective strategy to control the pandemic is suppressing virus spread through early detection of infections. Therefore, developing a rapid, accurate, easy-to-use diagnostic platform against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains necessary. Here, we developed an ultra-sensitive label-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based aptasensor as a countermeasure for the universal detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In this aptasensor platform, we discovered two DNA aptamers that enable binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via the Particle Display, a high-throughput screening approach. These showed high affinity that exhibited dissociation constants of 1.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0nM and 1.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0nM. We designed a combination with the aptamers and silver nanoforest for developing an ultra-sensitive SERS platform and achieved an attomolar (10<sup>-18</sup>\u00a0M) level detection limit with a recombinant trimeric spike protein. Furthermore, using the intrinsic properties of the aptamer signal, we demonstrated a label-free aptasensor approach, enabling use without the Raman tag. Finally, our label-free SERS-combined aptasensor succeeded in detecting SARS-CoV-2 with excellent accuracy, even in clinical samples with variants of concern, including the wild-type, delta, and omicron variants."
