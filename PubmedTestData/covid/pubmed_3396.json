        "Due to the importance of early outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalization and disease progression, we examined the effects of hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, which were initiated in early period, on the clinical course of COVID-19 outpatients.",
        "Data of confirmed COVID-19 outpatients over a 4-month period were analyzed retrospectively. Public Health Management System (HSYS) was used for the case-based follow-up. Patients on antiviral therapy for at least five days, including hydroxychloroquine and / or favipiravir and patients who were followed-up for 30 days were included in this analysis.",
        "We enrolled 1489 patients in this study. Overall, 775 (52%) patients were male and a mean age of patients was 38.9 \u00b1 11.1 years. Of these patients, 537 of them were received favipiravir, 545 of them were received hydroxychloroquine and 407 of them were received both favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms improvement on the 14th day of follow-up was 1.8 times higher in the group of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine compared to patients who received favipiravir (p = 0.003). On the 3rd day of follow- up, PCR negativity rate was higher in patients who received hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.004). Hospitalization rates were similar in patients receiving favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.144). However, in the presence of pneumonia at the time of diagnosis, the hospitalization rate was 6.6 times higher in patients who received favipiravir than those who received hydroxychloroquine.",
        "The subgroups of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and/or favipiravir did not have similar disease severities in our study. Therefore, further studies with homogeneous patient groups to be arranged prospectively are needed."
