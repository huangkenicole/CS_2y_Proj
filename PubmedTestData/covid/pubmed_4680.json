        "SARS-COV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in Wuhan in December 30, 2019, and is a family of SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), that is, coronavirus family. After infection with SARS-COV-2, patients often experience fever, cough, gas prostration, dyspnea and other symptoms, which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and even death. The SARS-COV-2 virus is particularly infectious and has led to a global infection crisis, with an explosion in the number of infections. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of the virus plays a vital role. At present, many detection methods are limited in their wide application due to their defects such as high preparation cost, poor stability and complex operation process. Moreover, some methods need to be operated by professional medical staff, which can easily lead to infection. In order to overcome these problems, a Surface molecular imprinting technology (SM-MIT) is proposed for the first time to detect SARS-COV-2 virus. For this SM-MIT method, this review provides detailed detection principles and steps. In addition, this method not only has the advantages of low cost, high stability and good specificity, but also can detect whether it is infected at designated points. Therefore, we think SM-MIT may have great potential in the detection of SARS-COV-2 virus."
