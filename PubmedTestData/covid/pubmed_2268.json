        "There have been over seven million cases and almost 413\u2009372 deaths globally due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated disease COVID-19, as of 11 June 2020. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, and\u00a0may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A\u00a0kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this\u00a0is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent reports available regarding the host-pathogen interaction, morphological and genomic structure of the virus, and the diagnostic techniques as well as the available potential therapeutics against COVID-19."
