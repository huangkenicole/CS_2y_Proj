        "Current national COVID\u201019 vaccination guidelines and recommendations focus vaccine guidance on patients with cancer. In this COVID\u201019 vaccination race, \u201ccocoon vaccination\u201d strategies, which include informal caregivers and household contacts as priority groups for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccination, could be an additional strategy used to protect patients with cancer who may have limited immune responses to current vaccinations. Medical systems specializing in cancer care should support education and vaccination campaigns which target informal caregivers and household contacts in addition to cancer patients."
