        "To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in tears of patients with COVID-19 in the early symptomatic stages and to compare two different sampling methods.",
        "In this cross-sectional study, tears sampling was performed in COVID-19 patients admitted within the first 7\u00a0days of symptom onset. The samples were collected with both conjunctival swabs and Schirmer strips. Each specimen was analyzed via RT-PCR. The viral load was evaluated in terms of the cycle threshold value. Ocular and systemic symptoms and comorbidities of the patients were also recorded.",
        "Forty patients were included. The average time from the initiation of symptoms was 3.15\u00a0days. Unilateral conjunctivitis has been observed in 5% of patients and foreign body sensation in 7.5% of patients. No viral RNA was detected in the tear samples of the patients with ocular findings. The positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 in tears was 2.5% (n\u2009=\u20091). None of the samples collected by Schirmer test strips yielded positive polymerase chain reaction result for SARS-COV-2. The Ct value of the positive conjunctival swab was 36.03 and the nasopharyngeal Ct value of the same patient was 25.68.",
        "The SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding rate has been determined as 2.5% in the tears of early symptomatic stage COVID-19 patients. The viral load of the tears was lower than the naso-oropharynx. The conjunctival swab method is recommended in tear collection to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR analysis in low viral load tears."
