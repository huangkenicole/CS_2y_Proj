        "COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to compact the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\u00a0and have been administered to people all over the world. These\u00a0vaccines have been quite effective in reducing the possibility of severe illness, hospitalization and death. However, the recent emergence of Variants of Concern specifically the delta variant, B.1.617.2, had resulted in additional waves of the pandemic.",
        "We aim to review the literature to understand the transmission and disease severity, and determine the efficacy of the current COVID-19\u00a0vaccines. We searched Pubmed, Scopus, and Embase till August 4th 2021, and used the search terms \"delta variant\", \"vaccinations\",\" breakthrough infections\", and \"neutralizing antibody\". For the meta-analysis, 21 studies were screened in particular and five articles (148,071 cases) were included in the study, and only four were analyzed in the meta-analysis.",
        "In\u00a0this review, both in vitro and in vivo studies showed significant reductions in neutralization rates against delta variants for vaccinated individuals and convalescent patients with prior history of COVID-19.\u00a0However,\u00a0There was a lower incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to Delta variant was found after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines.",
        "In fully vaccinated individuals, symptomatic infection with the delta variant was significantly reduced, and therefore, vaccinations play an important role to assist the fight against delta variant."
