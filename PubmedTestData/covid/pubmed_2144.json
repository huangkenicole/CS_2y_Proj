        "During the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was introduced without a full understanding of the assays performance or the antibody kinetics following infection with SARS-CoV-2.",
        "We performed an evaluation of 2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with a more detailed look into the effect of immune status on antibody sensitivity.",
        "Both assays demonstrated 100% specificity. The overall sensitivity of the Roche was 92.1% at \u226514 days and 94.8% at \u226521 days, and the overall sensitivity of the Abbott was 94.4% at \u226514 days and 98.2% at \u226521 days. 7/41 (17%) of patients included in this cohort were immunocompromised. Seroconversion was seen less commonly in the immunocompromised (4/7 [57.1%] seroconverted) and after excluding these patients 100% sensitivity was seen in both assays at \u226521 days.",
        "Performance of both assays in the immunocompetent appeared excellent after 21 days postsymptom onset. Both assays are highly specific."
