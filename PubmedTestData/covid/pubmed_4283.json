        "At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raging worldwide, and the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 seriously threatens the life and health of all humankind. There is no specific medicine for novel coronavirus yet. So, laboratory diagnoses of novel coronavirus as soon as possible and isolation of the source of infection play a vital role in preventing and controlling the epidemic. Therefore, selecting appropriate detection techniques and methods is particularly important to improve the efficiency of disease diagnosis and treatment and to curb the outbreak of infectious diseases. In this paper, virus nucleic acid, protein, and serum immunology were reviewed to provide a reference for further developing virus detection technology to provide better prevention and treatment strategies and research ideas for clinicians and researchers."
