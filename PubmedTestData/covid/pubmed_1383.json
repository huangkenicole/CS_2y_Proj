        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus causing serious human disease to spread across the world in the past 20 years, after SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. As of mid-September 2020, more than 200 countries and territories have reported 30 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, including 950,000 deaths. Supportive treatment remains the mainstay of therapy for COVID-19. The World Health Organization reported that four candidate drugs, including remdesivir, are ineffective or have little effect on COVID-19. According to China News, 90 % of Chinese patients with COVID-19 use traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with an effectiveness rate of 80 %, and no deterioration in patient condition. We have compiled the direct evidence of TCM treatment for COVID-19 as of December 31, 2020. We describe the advantages of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 based on clinical evidence and the required methods for its clinical use. TCM can inhibit virus replication and transcription, prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 and the host, and attenuate the cytokine storm and immune deficiency caused by the virus infection. The cooperation of many countries is required to establish international guidelines regarding the use of TCM in patients with severe COVID-19 from other regions and of different ethnicities. Studies on the psychological abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, and medical staff, is lacking; it is necessary to provide a complete chain of evidence to determine the efficacy of TCM in the related prevention, treatment, and recovery. This study aims to provide a reference for the rational use of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19."
