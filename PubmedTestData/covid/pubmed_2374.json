        "The management of discharge COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA is challenging. However, there are fewer scientific dissertations about the risk of recurrent positive. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between SARS-COV-2 RNA positive duration (SPD) and the risk of recurrent positive.",
        "This case-control multi-center study enrolled participants from 8 Chinese hospital including 411 participants (recurrent positive 241). Using unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, generalized additive model with a smooth curve fitting, we evaluated the associations between SPD and risk of recurrent positive. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed to explore the potential interactions.",
        "Among recurrent positive patients, there were 121 females (50.2%), median age was 50\u00a0years old [interquartile range (IQR): 38-63]. In non-adjusted model and adjusted model, SPD was associated with an increased risk of recurrent positive (fully-adjusted model: OR\u2009=\u20091.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, P\u2009=\u20090.001); the curve fitting was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.286). Comparing with SPD\u2009<\u200914\u00a0days, the risk of recurrent positive in SPD\u2009>\u200928\u00a0days was risen substantially (OR\u2009=\u20093.09, 95% CI: 1.44-6.63, P\u2009=\u20090.004). Interaction and stratified analyses showed greater effect estimates of SPD and risk of recurrent positive in the hypertension, low monocyte count and percentage patients (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.008, 0.002, 0.036, respectively).",
        "SPD was associated with a higher risk of recurrent positive and especially SPD\u2009>\u200928\u00a0day had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of re-positive as compared with SPD\u2009<\u200914\u00a0day. What's more, the risk may be higher among those with hypertension and lower monocyte count or percentage."
