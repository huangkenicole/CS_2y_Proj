        "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its complications have demonstrated the devastating impact of a new infectious pathogen. The organisational change promulgated by the isolation of affected communities is of extreme importance to achieve effective containment of the contagion and good patient care. The epidemiological study of the population of a small rural community in the North East of Italy revealed how much the virus had circulated during Spring, 2020, and how contagion has evolved after a prolonged lockdown. In the 1st phase, NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing) was performed in cases with more or less severe symptoms and a study was performed to trace the infection of family members. Only 0.2% of the population tested positive on NAAT, via nasopharyngeal swab during this 1st phase. In the 2nd phase a random sample of the general population were tested for circulating anti-Sars-Cov-2 immunoglobulins. This showed that approximately 97.9% of the population were negative, while 2.1% (with positive IgG at a distance) of the population had contracted the virus in a mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic form. The main symptom in subjects who developed immunity was fever. Antibodies were found in subjects with forced coexistence with quarantined or infected subjects. The mutual spatial distance by categories has shown higher relative prevalence of IgG positive and IgM negative cases in close proximity but also far from the infected, with respect to an intermediate distance. This suggests that subjects living in thinly populated areas could come in contact with the virus more likely due to intentional/relational proximity, while those living nearby could also be infected through random proximity."
