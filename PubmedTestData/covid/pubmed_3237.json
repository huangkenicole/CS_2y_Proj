        "To evaluate if reduced muscle mass, assessed with Computed Tomography (CT), is a predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.",
        "In this Institution Review Board approved study, we retrospectively evaluated COVID-19 patients treated in our tertiary center from March to November 2020 who underwent an unenhanced chest CT scan within three weeks from hospitalization.We recorded the mean Hounsfield Unit (Hu) value of the right paravertebral muscle at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, the hospitalization unit (ICU and COVID-19 wards), clinical symptoms, Barthel Index, and laboratory findings.Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess if muscle loss (Hu<30) is a predictor of ICU admission and outcome.Fisher's exact and Student's tests were applied to evaluate if differences between patients with and without muscle loss occurred (p<0.05).",
        "One-hundred-fifty patients matched the inclusion criteria (46 females; mean age\u00b1SD 61.3\u00b115 years-old), 36 treated in ICU. Patients in ICU showed significantly lower Hu values (29\u00b124 vs 39.4\u00b112, p = 0.001). Muscle loss was a predictor of ICU admission (p = 0.004).Patients with muscle loss were significantly older (73.4\u00b110 vs 56.4\u00b114 years), had lower Barthel Index scores (54.4\u00b133 vs 85.1\u00b126), red blood-cell count (3.9\u00b11 vs 4.6\u00b11\u00d71012L-1), and Hb levels (11.5\u00b12 vs 13.2\u00b12g/l) as well as higher white blood-cell count (9.4\u00b17 vs 7.2\u00b14\u00d7109L-1), C-reactive protein (71.5\u00b171 vs 44\u00b148U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (335\u00b1163 vs 265.8\u00b1116U/L) (p<0.05, each).",
        "Muscle loss seems to be a predictor of ICU hospitalization in COVID-19 patients and radiologists reporting chest CT at admission should note this finding in their reports."
