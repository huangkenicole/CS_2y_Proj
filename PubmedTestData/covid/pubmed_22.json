        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201119) outbreak, which has caused >46\u00a0millions confirmed infections and >1.2\u00a0million coronavirus related deaths, is one of the most devastating worldwide crises in recent years. Infection with COVID\u201119 results in a fever, dry cough, general fatigue, respiratory symptoms, diarrhoea and a sore throat, similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The causative agent of COVID\u201119, SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, is a novel coronavirus strain. To date, remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for use in the management of infection. Additionally, several efficient diagnostic tools are being actively developed, and novel drugs and vaccines are being evaluated for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against COVID\u201119, or in the prevention of infection. The present review highlights the prevalent clinical manifestations of COVID\u201119, characterizes the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 viral genome sequence and life cycle, highlights the optimal methods for preventing viral transmission, and discusses possible molecular pharmacological mechanisms and approaches in the development of anti\u2011SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 therapeutic agents. In addition, the use of traditional Chinese medicines for management of COVID\u201119 is discussed. It is expected that novel anti\u2011viral agents, vaccines or an effective combination therapy for treatment/management of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection and spread therapy will be developed and implemented in 2021, and we would like to extend our best regards to the frontline health workers across the world in their fight against COVID\u201119."
