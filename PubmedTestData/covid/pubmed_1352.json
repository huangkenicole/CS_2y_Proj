        "Over six million people have died worldwide as a result of SARS-CoV-19 (Covid-19). Several major and minor variant waves of Covid-19 including the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) have infected patients in the last two years. These individual variants have been associated with different infectivity and death rates, and it is anticipated that other variants of significance will occur. As a result, the emergence and frequency of the different Covid-19 variants at various locations in the world are critically important to monitor. To date, sequencing of these variants has been the primary method to track the prevalence of the different variants, but this approach is relatively slow and expensive. In contrast, we have developed two qPCR methods that are sensitive, specific, and economical which can distinguish the Omicron variant from the other variants. The first qPCR method detects a specific base mutation in Omicron enabling improved amplification. The second method is based on designing a primer specific for the region in which a deletion and an insertion have occurred in the Omicron variant. While the first approach can be readily adapted to identify other variants with point mutations, the second method can identify emerging deletion/insertion mutations such as BA.2, a subvariant of the Omicron."
