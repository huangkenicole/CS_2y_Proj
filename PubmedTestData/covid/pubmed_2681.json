        "The outbreak of the newly discovered human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has disrupted the normal life of almost every civilization worldwide. Studies have shown that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 can affect multiple human organs and physiological systems, but the respiratory system remains the primary location for viral infection.",
        "We summarize how omics technologies are used in SARS-CoV-2 research and specifically review the current knowledge of COVID-19 from the aspect of human bronchial-pulmonary proteomics. Also, knowledge gaps in COVID-19 that can be fulfilled by proteomics are discussed.",
        "Overall, human bronchial-pulmonary proteomics plays an important role in revealing the dynamics, functions, tropism, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial for COVID-19 biomarker and therapeutic target discoveries. To more fully understand the impact of COVID-19, research from various angles using multi-omics approaches should also be conducted on the lungs as well as other organs."
