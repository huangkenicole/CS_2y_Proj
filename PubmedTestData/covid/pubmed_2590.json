        "Diarrhea, often severe, is a recognized and frequently early symptom during acute COVID-19 infection and may persist or develop for the first time in patients with long-COVID, with socioeconomic consequences. Diarrheal mechanisms in these cases are poorly understood. There is evidence for disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function and also for changes in the gut microbiome, which is critical for gut immunity and metabolism. Whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus has adverse effects on intestinal transport proteins is unclear. However, the ability of the virus to inhibit expression and activity of an aldosterone-regulated epithelial sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel (ENaC) present in human distal colon, which is responsible for Na<sup>+</sup> and water salvage, points to possible disruption of other intestinal transport proteins during COVID-19 infection. In this Perspective, we develop this idea by highlighting possible intestinal transport protein targets for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and discussing how their interactions might be explored in the laboratory."
