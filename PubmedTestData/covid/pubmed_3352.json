      "AbstractText": [
        "We evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, having the highest population density in the country, under real-world conditions.",
        "We evaluated the reduction in the effectiveness of mRNA and viral-vector COVID-19 vaccines against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a subpopulation from April 2021 to July 2021 who visited screening clinics in Seoul using a test-negative case-control study design. Moreover, we conducted a case-control study matching the ten-year-old age group, sex, healthcare workers, and five districts of Seoul, which are considered confounding factors.",
        "The full VE in the pre-delta-dominant period was 95.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.2-97.2); however, it decreased to 61.1% (95% CI: 53.2-67.6) during the delta-dominant period. Notably, we found that COVID-19 VE was significantly decreased in individuals aged \u226580 years (52.9%, 95% CI: -9.9-79.8), men (50.6 %, 95% CI: 39.4-59.8), and asymptomatic individuals (49.8%, 95% CI: 36.5-60.3) during the widespread SARS-CoV-2 delta variant circulation.",
        "Vaccine-mediated protection drastically declined during the delta-dominant period and in vulnerable groups. This study suggests the requirement for additional countermeasures, such as the administration of a booster vaccine, in vulnerable groups based on age, sex, and symptomatic manifestation."
