        "The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers high sensitivity, but has some drawbacks, such as the time required for the RNA extraction. Transcription reverse-transcription concerted reaction (TRC) Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i is easy to use and can be performed in about 40 minutes. TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i and real-time one-step RT-PCR using the TaqMan probe tests of cryopreserved nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were compared. The primary objective was to examine the positive and negative concordance rates. A total of 69 samples cryopreserved at -80\u00b0 C were examined. Of the 37 frozen samples that were expected to be RT-PCR positive, 35 were positive by the RT-PCR method. TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i detected 33 positive cases and 2 negative cases. One frozen sample that was expected to be RT-PCR positive was negative on both TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i and RT-PCR. In addition, one frozen sample that was expected to be RT-PCR positive was positive by the RT-PCR method and negative by TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i. Of the 32 frozen samples that were expected to be RT-PCR negative, both the RT-PCR method and TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i yielded negative results for all 32 samples. Compared with RT-PCR, TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i had a positive concordance rate of 94.3% and a negative concordance rate of 97.1%. TRC Ready<sup>\u00ae</sup> SARS-CoV-2 i can be utilized in a wide range of medical sites such as clinics and community hospitals due to its ease of operability, and is expected to be useful in infection control."
