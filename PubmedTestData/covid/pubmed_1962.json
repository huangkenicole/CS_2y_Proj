        "The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread all over the world. The large amount of information that appears every day requires comprehension and systematization. The immunological aspects of the virus-host interaction are the core issues in the effective treatment and prevention of COVID-19' development. The review analyzes the known pathways of the viral invasion and evasion, the mechanisms of the cytokine storm, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data from previous SARS and MERS epidemics is discussed here. We also address the therapeutic approaches based on the basic knowledge of immune response and the blood cells' immune functions, as well as the ways to reduce their hyperactivation. The use of interferon therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, anti-cytokine therapy, neutralizing antibodies, convalescent plasma, and mesenchymal stem cells, as well as prophylactic vaccines, is discussed."
