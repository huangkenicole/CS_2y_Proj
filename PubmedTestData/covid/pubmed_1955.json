        "We use event study models based on staggered summer vacations in Germany to estimate the effect of school reopenings after the summer of 2021 on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Estimations are based on daily counts of confirmed coronavirus infections across all 401 German counties. A central antipandemic measure in German schools included mandatory rapid testing multiple times per week. Our results are consistent with mandatory testing contributing to the containment of the viral spread. We find a short-term increase in infection rates right after summer breaks, indicating the uncovering of otherwise undetected (asymptomatic) cases through the testing. After a period of about 2 wk after school reopenings, the growth of case numbers is smaller in states that reopened schools compared with the control group of states still in summer break. The results show a similar pattern for older age groups as well, arguably as a result of detected clusters through the school testing. This means that under certain conditions, open schools can play a role in containing the spread of the virus. Our results suggest that closing schools as a means to reduce infections may have unintended consequences by giving up surveillance and should be considered only as a last resort."
