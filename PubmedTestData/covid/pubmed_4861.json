        "In 2020, a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) whose disease is called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported. This virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China and has infected 90,308 people per March 2, 2020. As of the end of October 2020, more than 40 million people have been infected, with the death toll reaching 1,150,000 worldwide. Apart from respiratory tract infections, patients infected with this virus may exhibit other symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. This means that the virus can be found in feces and anus, hence the anal swab can be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 infection. The results of the specimen test show that the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal swab positive detection rate is the highest and remains the gold standard for diagnosis. This sensitivity can also be influenced by the course of the disease that can infect the gastrointestinal tract so that anal PCR is performed for the diagnosis to detect the COVID-19 virus in patients."
