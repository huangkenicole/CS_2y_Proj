        "The pandemic of SARS CoV-2 has required urgent medical treatments for numerous patients. As no specific antiviral agents were available, different off-the-shelf alternatives have been explored.",
        "Here, we review the rationale behind the use of Favipiravir, and report of the specific studies supporting this treatment being conducted.",
        "Here we analyze the relevant literature to conclude about the present opportunities offered by this therapeutic agent.",
        "This antiviral drug approved influenza in Japan since 2014, has a demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 and is being investigated in several trials for SARS CoV-2. Signals of benefit were shown in a small trial for SARS CoV-2. However, in another small study, there was no advantage.",
        "Further studies, statistically more significant, are urgently needed to understand the best opportunities offered by this treatment."
