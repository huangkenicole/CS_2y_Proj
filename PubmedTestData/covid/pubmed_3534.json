      "AbstractText": [
        "An outbreak of the novel beta coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first came to light in December 2019, which has unfolded rapidly and turned out to be a global pandemic. Early prognosis of viral contamination involves speedy intervention, disorder control, and good-sized management of the spread of disease. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, considered the gold standard test for detecting nucleic acids and pathogen diagnosis, provides high sensitivity and specificity. However, reliance on high-priced equipped kits, associated reagents, and skilled personnel slow down sickness detection. Lately, the improvement of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat\u00a0(CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated protein)-based diagnostic systems has reshaped molecular diagnosis due to their low cost, simplicity, speed, efficiency, high sensitivity, specificity, and versatility, which is vital for accomplishing point-of-care diagnostics. We reviewed and summarized CRISPR-Cas-based point-of-care diagnostic strategies and research in these paintings while highlighting their characteristics and challenges for identifying SARS-CoV-2."
