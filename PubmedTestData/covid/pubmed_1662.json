        "Coronavirus disease is a potentially deadly disease and of significant apprehension for global communal health because of its lethality. Vaccines and antiviral medications are still under trial to prevent or treat human coronavirus (HCoV) till date. The virus HCoV originated in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes respiratory syndrome having distinctive pathogenesis and infections of the respiratory tract. A mechanism was projected for the evolution of SARS virus, and a handy association with bats was found. When this virus reaches the respective host system, the infection starts with spike protein binding to its complementary receptor of the host cell. The coronavirus spike protein's association with its host cell receptor complement is crucial in deciding the virus infectivity, tissue tropism and species variety. Recent studies show that SARS Coronavirus 2 or COVID-19 requires protease to get into cells, offering a new therapeutic target. Distinctive attention and exertions should be given to defending or reducing transmission in vulnerable populaces, including those directly associated with caregiving and treatment and also aged one. Researchers are planning to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, and in this approach are also considered developing a vaccine that sensitizes our immune system preventing from this pandemic. The present review focuses on the role of S-spike protein in COVID-19, which helps the virus intruding the enzyme ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2). Passive antibody therapy is an additional alternative to use blood donors from hale and hearty people who have already recovered from COVID-19 and therapeutic advancement in handling the COVID-19 pandemic."
