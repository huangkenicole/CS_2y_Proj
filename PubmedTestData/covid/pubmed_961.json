        "As expected, several new variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and have been detected around the world throughout this Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is no specific developed drug against COVID-19 and the challenge of developing effective antiviral strategies based on natural agents with different mechanisms of action becomes an urgent need and requires identification of genetic differences among variants. Such data is used to improve therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 variants. Nature is known to offer many biotherapeutics from animal venoms, algae and plant that have been historically used in traditional medicine. Among these bioresources, snake venom displays many bioactivities of interest such as antiviral, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antitumoral. COVID-19 is a viral respiratory sickness due to SARS-CoV-2 which induces thrombotic disorders due to cytokine storm, platelet hyperactivation and endothelial dysfunction. This review aims to: (1) present an overview on the infection, the developed thrombo-inflammatory responses and mechanisms of induced thrombosis of COVID-19 compared to other similar pathogenesis; (2) underline the role of natural compounds such as anticoagulant, antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents; (3) investigate the management of coagulopathy related to COVID-19 and provide insight on therapeutic such as venom compounds. We also summarize the updated advances on antiviral proteins and peptides derived from snake venoms that could weaken coagulopathy characterizing COVID-19."
