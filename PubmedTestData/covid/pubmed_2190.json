        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided a stage to illustrate that there is considerable value in obtaining rapid, whole-genome-based information about pathogens. This article describes the utility of a commercially available, automated severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) library preparation, genome sequencing, and a bioinformatics analysis pipeline to provide rapid, near-real-time SARS-CoV-2 variant description. This study evaluated the turnaround time, accuracy, and other quality-related parameters obtained from commercially available automated sequencing instrumentation, from analysis of continuous clinical samples obtained from January 1, 2021, to October 6, 2021. This analysis included a base-by-base assessment of sequencing accuracy at every position in the SARS-CoV-2 chromosome using two commercially available methods. Mean turnaround time, from the receipt of a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 testing to the availability of the results, with lineage assignment, was <3 days. Accuracy of sequencing by one method was 100%, although certain sites on the genome were found repeatedly to have been sequenced with varying degrees of read error rate."
