        "(1) Background. Exploring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 load and clearance from the upper respiratory tract samples is important to improving COVID-19 control. Data were collected retrospectively from a laboratory dataset on SARS-CoV-2 load quantified in leftover nasal pharyngeal swabs (NPSs) collected from symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals who tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the framework of testing activities for diagnostic/screening purpose during the 2020 and 2021 winter epidemic waves. (2) Methods. A Statistical approach (quantile regression and survival models for interval-censored data), novel for this kind of data, was applied. We included in the analysis SARS-CoV-2-positive adults >18 years old for whom at least two serial NPSs were collected. A total of 262 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and 784 NPSs were included: 193 (593 NPSs) during the 2020 winter wave (before COVID-19 vaccine introduction) and 69 (191 NPSs) during the 2021 winter wave (all COVID-19 vaccinated). We estimated the trend of the median value, as well as the 25th and 75th centiles of the viral load, from the index episode (i.e., first SARS-CoV-2-positive test) until the sixth week (2020 wave) and the third week (2021 wave). Interval censoring methods were used to evaluate the time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance (defined as Ct < 35). (3) Results. At the index episode, the median value of viral load in the 2021 winter wave was 6.25 log copies/mL (95% CI: 5.50-6.70), and the median value in the 2020 winter wave was 5.42 log copies/mL (95% CI: 4.95-5.90). In contrast, 14 days after the index episode, the median value of viral load was 3.40 log copies/mL (95% CI: 3.26-3.54) for individuals during the 2020 winter wave and 2.93 Log copies/mL (95% CI: 2.80-3.19) for those of the 2021 winter wave. A significant difference in viral load shapes was observed among age classes (<i>p</i> = 0.0302) and between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (<i>p</i> = 0.0187) for the first wave only; the median viral load value is higher at the day of episode index for the youngest (18-39 years) as compared to the older (40-64 years and >64 years) individuals. In the 2021 epidemic, the estimated proportion of individuals who can be considered infectious (Ct < 35) was approximately half that of the 2020 wave. (4) Conclusions. In case of the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the application of these statistical methods to the analysis of virological laboratory data may provide evidence with which to inform and promptly support public health decision-makers in the modification of COVID-19 control measures."
