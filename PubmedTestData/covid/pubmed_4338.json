        "An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). So far, there have been various approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection, each having its pros and cons. The current gold-standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which offers acceptable specificity and sensitivity, is the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). However, this method requires considerable cost and time to transport samples to specialized laboratories and extract, amplify, and detect the viral genome. On the other hand, antigen and antibody testing approaches that bring rapidity and affordability into play have lower sensitivity and specificity during the early stages of COVID-19. Moreover, the immune response is variable depending on the individual. Methods based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) can be used as an alternative approach to controlling the spread of disease by a high-sensitive, specific, and low-cost molecular diagnostic system. CRISPR-based detection systems (CRISPR-Dx) target the desired sequences by specific CRISPR-RNA (crRNA)-pairing on a pre-amplified sample and a subsequent collateral cleavage. In the present article, we have reviewed different CRISPR-Dx methods and presented their benefits and drawbacks for point-of-care testing (POCT) of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections at home or in small clinics."
