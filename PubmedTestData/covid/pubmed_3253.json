        "This study aimed to investigate COVID-19 spread among people experiencing homelessness (PEH), undocumented migrants (UMs), and shelter staff of homeless service sites. Another aim has been to prevent an outbreak among these populations. A San Gallicano Institute's initiative to sustain the health system in helping hard-to-reach populations, very often with no community medical care coverage.",
        "The San Gallicano Dermatological Institute performed active surveillance for COVID-19 on PEH and UMs living in Rome and Latina, Italy. The screening was performed with two swabs: real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen rapid tests.",
        "From June 2020 to January 2022, we performed 10,651 tests: 5,442 molecular swabs and 5,209 antigen rapid tests. A total of 3,503 individuals were screened. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.9% among the health and social workers and 5.7% among PEH and UMs. None of the people positive for COVID-19 had symptoms or signs of several illnesses. PEH and UMs who tested positive for COVID-19, asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, were transferred to a COVID Hotel or dedicated apartment for further clinical monitoring.",
        "People experiencing homelessness and undocumented migrants are often not registered in the National Health Service and, therefore, difficult to trace. These data could aid in estimating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among people experiencing homelessness, undocumented migrants, and shelter staff in two Italian cities."
