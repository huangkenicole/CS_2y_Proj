        "Recently, a corona virus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel corona virus (sevier acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2; SARS-CoV-2), rapidly spread throughout the world. It has been resulted an unprecedented public health crisis and has become a global threat. WHO declared it as a pandemic due to rapid transmission and severity of the disease. According to WHO, as of 22nd of August 2020, the disease spread over 213 countries of the world having 22,812,491 confirmed cases and 795,132 deaths recorded worldwide. In the absence of suitable antiviral drugs and vaccines, the current pandemic has created an urgent need for accurate diagnostic tools that would be helpful for early detection of the patients. Many tests including classical and high-throughput techniques have developed and obtained U.S. Food and drug administration (FDA) approval. However, efforts are being made to develop new diagnostic tools for detection of the disease. Several molecular diagnostic tests such as real-time-polymerase chain reaction, real-time isothermal loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP), full genome analysis by next-generation sequencing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technique and microarray-based assays along with other techniques such as computed tomography scan, biomarkers, biosensor, nanotechnology, serological test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), isolation of viral strain in cell culture are currently available for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. This review provides a brief overview of promising high-throughput techniques currently used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, along with their scope and limitations that may be used for effective control of the disease."
