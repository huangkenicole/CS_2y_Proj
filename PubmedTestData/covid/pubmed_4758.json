      "AbstractText": [
        "A lack of vitamin D is a potential risk factor for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Variants in the Vitamin D Receptor (<i>VDR</i>) gene, such as <i>Bgl</i>I rs739837 and <i>TaqI</i> rs731236, are associated with various viral infection progressions. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the <i>BglI</i> rs739837 and <i>TaqI</i> rs731236 polymorphisms and the mortality rate of COVID-19 based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. The genotyping of <i>BglI</i> rs739837 and <i>TaqI</i> rs731236 genotypes was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 1734 improved and 1450 deceased patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the rate of COVID-19 mortality was correlated with <i>TaqI</i> rs731236 TC and CC in the \u03b1 variant and with <i>TaqI</i> rs731236 CC in the Delta variant, whereas no relationship was found in the Omicron BA.5 variant. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 mortality was associated with <i>BglI</i> rs739837 GT and TT in the Omicron BA.5 variant, while there was no association between <i>BglI</i> rs739837 and COVID-19 mortality in the \u03b1 and Delta variants. The TG haplotype was more common in all SARS-CoV-2 variants, while the CT haplotype was associated with COVID-19 mortality in the Delta and Omicron BA.5 variants. In conclusion, this study indicated that the impacts of <i>BglI</i> rs739837 and <i>TaqI</i> rs731236 polymorphisms were related to SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, further research is still needed to approve our findings."
