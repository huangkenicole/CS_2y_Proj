        "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been a huge public health challenge that has led to significant morbidity and mortality across the globe. Given the high prevalence and continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, accurate and rapid point-of-care testing is critical.",
        "Knowledge of role of digital technology including smart and connected devices in rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is an evolving area of scientific investigation. This review discusses the importance of rapid at-home point-of-care testing, highlighting the possible role of smart and connected device-based molecular diagnostics for COVID-19.",
        "Accurate and rapid diagnostic modalities have the potential to improve accessibility and efficiency of diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and could be instrumental in timely implementation of appropriate therapeutic interventions as well as public health measures to mitigate spread of infection. With emerging challenges like newer viral variants, global vaccine shortages and vaccine hesitancy, accurate diagnostic testing with the ability to rapidly identify infection remains critical. Digital technologies are likely to become important tools in future of healthcare and technological advancements may play a crucial role in response to COVID-19 with the goal of ultimately overcoming this pandemic."
