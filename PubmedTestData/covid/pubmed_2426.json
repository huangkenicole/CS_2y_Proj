        "There are few reports of COVID-19 in neonates and most are suspected to be due to postnatal transmission. Vertical transmission has been proven in only a couple of cases so far.",
        "We describe early-onset, severe COVID-19 disease in a neonate with very strong evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
        "A COVID-19 suspected mother, who tested negative by RT-PCR for COVID, but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by serology, delivered a term baby. The neonate was kept in strict isolation. Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 on umbilical stump, placenta, and nasopharyngeal aspirate of the neonate, collected at birth were positive. On day 2, the neonate developed clinical features of COVID in the form of fever, poor feeding, and hyperbilirubenemia along with elevated inflammatory markers. Antibiotics were started empirically pending cultures. Blood, CSF, and urine cultures were sterile. Baby tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two more occasions before testing positive for antibodies and was discharged on day 21 of life.",
        "This report highlights a very strong possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from a mildly symptomatic, RT-PCR negative but antibody-positive mother with significant symptomatic, early-onset neonatal infection."
