        "Fast evolving of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has caused the spreading of COVID-19 disease rapidly around the globe. The mutation, especially in the gene encoding spike protein has helped the virus adapt and evade human immune system, as well as affect the efficacy of the immunizations and treatments. SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying D614G amino acid change at the spike protein is the most dominant strain in the pandemic. Therefore, efficient detection of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including D614G mutation is critical to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report a dual synthetic mismatches CRISPR/Cas12a (dsmCRISPR) method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation with high sensitivity and specificity. By targeting SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation, synthetic mismatch crRNAs were designed from -3 to +3 position around the mutation site. To improve the sensitivity and specificity, a synthetic mismatch primer with a 3'-terminal base complementary to the D614G point mutation and a mismatch next to 3'-terminal base was used to specifically amplify the D614G mutation site with higher annealing temperature. Using synthetic mismatch crRNA-(-1), a higher ratio (13.45) of the fluorescence between G614 and D614 was observed. When combined with mismatch primer to amplify D614G mutation, the fluorescence ratio of G614/D164 template detected was increased by 73.53% to 23.12. This method can detect the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation nucleic acid with high sensitivity, which was validated with synthetic SARS-CoV-2 D614G RNA. Therefore, the dsmCRIPSR method has significant potential to serve as a sensitive and specific assay for SARS-CoV-2 D614G detection and could be further extended for the detection of other SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest."
