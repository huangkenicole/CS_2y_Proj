        "The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Hubei, China, in December 2019, has had a profound impact on global public health. With the elucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus structure, genome type, and routes of infection, a variety of diagnostic methods have been developed for COVID-19 detection and surveillance. Although the pandemic has been declared over, we are still significantly affected by it in our daily lives in the post-pandemic era. Among the various diagnostic methods, nanomaterials, especially metallic nanomaterials, have shown great potential in the field of bioanalysis due to their unique physical and chemical properties. This review highlights the important role of metallic nanosensors in achieving accurate and efficient detection of COVID-19 during the pandemic outbreak and spread. The sensing mechanisms of each diagnostic device capable of analyzing a range of targets, including viral nucleic acids and various proteins, are described. Since SARS-CoV-2 is constantly mutating, strategies for dealing with new variants are also suggested. In addition, we discuss the analytical tools needed to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants in the current post-pandemic era, with a focus on achieving rapid and accurate detection. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions of metallic nanomaterial-based COVID-19 detection, which may inspire researchers to develop advanced biosensors for COVID-19 monitoring and rapid response to other virus-induced pandemics based on our current achievements."
