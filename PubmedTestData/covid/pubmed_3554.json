      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the need for the rapid generation of efficient vaccines for emerging disease. Virus-like particles, VLPs, are an established vaccine technology that produces virus-like mimics, based on expression of the structural proteins of a target virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus where the basis of VLP formation has been shown to be the co-expression of the spike, membrane and envelope structural proteins. Here we describe the generation of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs by the co-expression of the salient structural proteins in insect cells using the established baculovirus expression system. VLPs were heterologous ~100 nm diameter enveloped particles with a distinct fringe that reacted strongly with SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. In a Syrian hamster challenge model, non-adjuvanted VLPs induced neutralizing antibodies to the VLP-associated Wuhan S protein and reduced virus shedding and protected against disease associated weight loss following a virulent challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 variant). Immunized animals showed reduced lung pathology and lower challenge virus replication than the non-immunized controls. Our data suggest SARS-CoV-2 VLPs offer an efficient vaccine that mitigates against virus load and prevents severe disease."
