      "AbstractText": [
        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently caused the pandemic with a high progressive speed and has been considered as the global public health crisis in 2020. This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter.",
        "Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine.",
        "There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy."
