        "The aim of this study was to investigate the reinfection rates and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in their clinical specimens for COVID-19. Our data from the COVID-19 Laboratory of Istanbul University were analyzed for 27,240 cases between 27 March 2020 to 8 February 2022. Demographic characteristics, vaccination statuses, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were evaluated in cases with suspected reinfection, as determined by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a rate of 0.3% in clinical specimens. When comparing laboratory values, leukocyte counts were lower in the second and third infections compared with the first infection (<i>p</i> = 0.035), and neutrophil counts were lower in the second infection (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Symptoms varied, with coughing being common in the first infection and malaise being common in subsequent infections. These results suggest that it is important to continue to monitor reinfection rates and develop strategies to prevent reinfection. Our results also suggest that clinicians should be aware of the possibility of reinfection and monitor patients for recurrent symptoms."
