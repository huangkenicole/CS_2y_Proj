        "The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous damage to the social economy and people's health. Some major issues fighting COVID-19 include early and accurate diagnosis and the shortage of ventilator machines for critical patients. In this manuscript, we describe a novel solution to deal with COVID-19: portable biosensing and wearable photoacoustic imaging for early and accurate diagnosis of infection and magnetic neuromodulation or minimally invasive electrical stimulation to replace traditional ventilation. The solution is a closed-loop system in that the three modules are integrated together and form a loop to cover all-phase strategies for fighting COVID-19. The proposed technique can guarantee ubiquitous and onsite detection, and an electrical hypoglossal stimulator can be more effective in helping severe patients and reducing complications caused by ventilators."
