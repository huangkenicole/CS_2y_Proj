        "In less than two decades, three deadly zoonotic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, have emerged in humans, causing SARS, MERS, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented crisis in health care and social and economic development. It reinforces the cruel fact that CoVs are constantly evolving, possessing the genetic malleability to become highly pathogenic in humans. In this review, we start with an overview of CoV diseases and the molecular virology of CoVs, focusing on similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its highly pathogenic as well as low-pathogenic counterparts. We then discuss mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, emphasizing the host immune response. Finally, we summarize strategies adopted for the prevention and treatment of CoV diseases and discuss approaches to develop effective antivirals and vaccines."
