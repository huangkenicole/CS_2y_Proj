        "In under a year, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, leaving millions of survivors in its wake. The enormous number of people who survived acute illness but continue to have symptoms has highlighted the need for standardized evaluation of the post-COVID-19 patient. This review, based on the current literature and our experience, aims to guide the care of patients who have survived COVID-19.",
        "The literature on this topic is rapidly expanding and covers both pulmonary and nonpulmonary complications of COVID-19. Pulmonary complications include dyspnea with normoxia, organizing pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. Nonpulmonary complications include neurologic, cardiac, and thromboembolic disease. Special consideration should be taken for COVID-19 survivors of intensive care.",
        "The current review outlines the major clinical findings in post-COVID-19 patients and provides a guidelines to the evaluation and management of prolonged symptoms."
