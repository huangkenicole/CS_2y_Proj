        "In emergency departments, rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u00a0was important for arranging limited isolation resources and patient care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u00a0pandemic. STANDARD M10 SARS-CoV-2 (SD Biosensor) is a recently developed cartridge-based RT-PCR\u00a0that provides a turnaround time of 1\u2009h, which is shorter than that for conventional RT-PCR.\u00a0This study evaluated the clinical performance of STANDARD M10 in patients visiting an emergency department. From March to June 2022, two specimens were collected from patients visiting an emergency department. Each specimen comprised one nasopharyngeal and one oropharyngeal swab. Respective specimens underwent rapid RT-PCR\u00a0using STANDARD M10 and conventional RT-PCR\u00a0using Allplex SARS-CoV-2 (Seegene). When discordant results occurred, specimens undergoing the STANDARD M10 were retested with the Allplex to exclude specimen variations. Retest results replaced initial results of the Allplex. Clinical performance of STANDARD M10 was compared with Allplex. The study enrolled 1971 patients. COVID-19 prevalence was 6.2% based on the Allplex. Compared with the Allplex, overall agreement, positive percent agreement, and negative percent agreement of STANDARD M10 were 99.5% (95% CI: 99.1%-99.8%), 95.9% (95% CI: 90.8%-98.3%), and 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%-99.9%), respectively. Nine discordant results were all positive on droplet digital PCR, except for one specimen that was positive with STANDARD M10. The STANDARD M10 showed reliable diagnostic performance for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from patients visiting in emergency departments and is a useful tool in emergency healthcare systems because of its easy-to-use cartridge-based assay and short resulting time for detecting SARS-CoV-2."
