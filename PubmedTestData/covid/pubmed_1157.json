        "The prevalence and prognostic implications of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with MetS.",
        "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate every article published up to 1 September 2021, reporting data on MetS among COVID-19 patients. The pooled prevalence of MetS was calculated using a random effects model and presented using the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I<sup>2</sup> statistic.",
        "Six studies, enrolling 209.569 COVID-19 patients [mean age 57.2 years, 114.188 males (54.4%)] met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 20.5% of cases (95% CI: 6.7-47.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.03), with high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 98.9%). Pre-existing MetS was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term mortality (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.52-3.45, <i>p</i> < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 89.4%). Meta-regression showed a direct correlation with male gender (<i>p</i> = 0.03), hypertension (<i>p</i> < 0.001), DM (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and hyperlipidaemia (<i>p</i> = 0.04), but no effect when considering age (<i>p</i> = 0.75) and chronic pulmonary disease (<i>p</i> = 0.86) as moderators.",
        "MetS represents a major comorbidity in about 20% of COVID-19 patients and it is associated with a 230% increased risk of short-term mortality."
