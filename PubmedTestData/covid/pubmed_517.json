        "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is the latest pandemic which has thrown the world into an unprecedented social and economic uncertainties along with huge loss to humanity. Identification of the host factors regulating the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human host may help in the development of novel anti-viral therapies to combat the viral infection and spread. Recently, some research groups used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screening to identify the host factors critical for the SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection. A comparative analysis of these significant host factors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) identified fifteen proteins common in these studies. Apart from ACE2 (receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment), other common host factors were CSNK2B, GDI2, SLC35B2, DDX51, VPS26A, ARPP-19, C1QTNF7, ALG6, LIMA1, COG3, COG8, BCOR, LRRN2 and TLR9. Additionally, viral interactome of these host factors revealed that many of them were associated with several SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well. Interestingly, some of these host factors have already been shown to be critical for the pathogenesis of other viruses suggesting their crucial role in virus-host interactions. Here, we review the functions of these host factors and their role in other diseases with special emphasis on viral diseases."
