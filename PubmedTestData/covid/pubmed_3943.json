      "AbstractText": [
        "During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, nasopharyngeal swabs, combined throat and nose swabs and saliva samples have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 detection using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT). Literature on anterior nasal swabs is limited. We investigated a novel anterior nasal swab that has been designed to standardised self-collection, maximise sample uptake and improve user comfort. We used combined throat and nose swabs and neat saliva samples as the comparators.",
        "The overall positive percentage agreement between the Rhinoswab\u2122 and the combined throat and nose swab was 95.2 % at day 2 post participant recruitment and 93.3 % on day 4 post participant recruitment. This was favourable to the positive percentage agreement with saliva at the same time points.",
        "In our study the Rhinoswab\u2122 performed equally well in comparison to a combined throat and nose swab for the laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 using nucleic acid amplification techniques."
