        "A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was firstly identified in Wuhan by the end of 2019. China has\u00a0implemented a series of preventive measures to deter COVID-19 spread and its consequences\u00a0since the beginning of the epidemic. In China, the expansion of COVID-19 has been\u00a0slowed down\u00a0significantly through the effort of all contributors, including governments,\u00a0nongovernments, and\u00a0civil society. All collaborators have been actively involved in combating the epidemic, using their respective strengths to play their roles. China has\u00a0mitigated the number of cases due to the mobilization of the whole society and collaborators joining collective efforts and actions in solidarity to tackle and\u00a0conquer the virus. To date, China has\u00a0continued to implement actions to control any resurgence of new cases of COVID-19 and keep its population safe. The people's united effort against the virus has enhanced a great insight into China, and it might serve as a model to the global community in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0 in terms of coordination, solidarity, decisiveness, and leadership."
