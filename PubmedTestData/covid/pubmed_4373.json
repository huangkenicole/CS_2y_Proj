      "AbstractText": [
        "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a huge impact on the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 could possibly and potentially be transmitted to humans through cold-chain foods and packaging (namely good-to-human), although it mainly depends on a human-to-human route. It is imperative to develop countermeasures to cope with the spread of viruses and fulfil effective surveillance of cold-chain foods and packaging. This review outlined SARS-CoV-2-related cold-chain food incidents and current methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Then the needs, challenges and practicable countermeasures for SARS-CoV-2 detection, specifically for cold-chain foods and packaging, were underlined. In fact, currently established detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 are mostly used for humans; thus, these may not be ideally applied to cold-chain foods directly. Therefore, it creates a need to develop novel methods and low-cost, automatic, mini-sized devices specifically for cold-chain foods and packaging. The review intended to draw people's attention to the possible spread of SARS-CoV-2 with cold-chain foods and proposed perspectives for futuristic cold-chain foods monitoring during the pandemic."
