        "The clinical and virological course of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are lacking. We aimed to describe the clinical and virological characteristics of COVID-19 patients from 10 designated hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China. The factors associated with the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated.",
        "A total of 328 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiology and treatment data were collected. The associated factors of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were analyzed.",
        "The median duration of hospitalization was 16.0\u00a0days (interquartile range [IQR] 13.0-21.0\u00a0days). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, age\u2009>\u200960\u00a0years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.643, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.454-0.911, P\u2009=\u20090.013) was associated with the delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance, while the atomized inhalation of interferon \u03b1-2b could improve the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (HR, 1.357, 95% CI 1.050-1.755, P\u2009=\u20090.020). Twenty-six (7.9%) patients developed respiratory failure and 4 (1.2%) patients developed ARDS. Twenty (6.1%) patients were admitted to the ICU, while no patient was deceased.",
        "Our study found that age\u2009>\u200960\u00a0years was associated with the delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance, while treated with atomized inhalation of interferon \u03b1-2b could promote the clearance of SARS-CoV-2."
