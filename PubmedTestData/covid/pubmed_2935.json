      "AbstractText": [
        "During the COVID-19 outbreak, most hospitals deferred elective surgical procedures to allow space for the overwhelming number of COVID-19 patient admissions, expecting a decrease in routine blood component requirements. However, because transfusion support needs of COVID-19 patients are not well known, its impact on hospital blood supply is uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transfusion demand.",
        "Transfusion records during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1-April 30, 2020) were reviewed in our center to assess changes in blood requirements.",
        "During this period 636 patients received a total of 2934 blood components, which reflects a 17.6% reduction in transfusion requirements with regard to the same period of 2019, and blood donations in Madrid dropped by 45%. The surgical blood demand decreased significantly during the outbreak (50.2%). Blood usage in the hematology and oncology departments remained unchanged, while the day ward demand halved, and intensive care unit transfusion needs increased by 116%. A total of 6.2% of all COVID inpatients required transfusion support. COVID-19 inpatients consumed 19% of all blood components, which counterbalanced the savings owed to the reduction in elective procedures.",
        "Although only a minority of COVID-19 inpatients required transfusion, the expected reduction in transfusion needs caused by the lack of elective surgical procedures is partially offset by the large number of admitted patients during the peak of the pandemic. This fact must be taken into account when planning hospital blood supply."
