        "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution process has generated several variants due to its continuous mutations, making pandemics more critical. The present study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its emerging mutations in five directions. First, the significant mutations in the genome and S-glycoprotein were analyzed in different variants. Three linear models were developed with the regression line to depict the mutational load for S-glycoprotein, total genome excluding S-glycoprotein, and whole genome. Second, the continent-wide evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with their clades and divergence were evaluated. It showed the region-wise evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and their clustering event. The major clades for each variant were identified. One example is clade 21K, a major clade of the Omicron variant. Third, lineage dynamics and comparison between SARS-CoV-2 lineages across different countries are also illustrated, demonstrating dominant variants in various countries over time. Fourth, gene-wise mutation patterns and genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 variants across various countries are illustrated. High mutation patterns were found in the ORF10, ORF6, S, and low mutation pattern E genes. Finally, emerging AA point mutations (T478K, L452R, N501Y, S477N, E484A, Q498R, and Y505H), their frequencies, and country-wise occurrence were identified, and the highest event of two mutations (T478K and L452R) was observed."
