        "Demographics, immunological profiles, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and saliva samples collected on admission, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were assessed in children below 18 years with COVID-19.",
        "91 patients were included between March and August 20 20. NPS and saliva viral loads were correlated (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.315, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01). Symptomatic patients had significantly higher NPS and saliva viral loads than asymptomatic patients. Serial NPS and saliva viral load measurements showed that the log<sub>10</sub> NPS (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.532, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and saliva (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.417, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) viral loads for all patients were inversely correlated with the days from symptom onset with statistical significance. Patients with cough, sputum, and headache had significantly higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads. Higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads were associated with total lymphopenia, CD3 and CD4 lymphopenia (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05), and were inversely correlated with total lymphocyte (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.43), CD3 (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.55), CD4 (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.60), CD8 (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.41), B (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.482), and NK (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.416) lymphocyte counts (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05).",
