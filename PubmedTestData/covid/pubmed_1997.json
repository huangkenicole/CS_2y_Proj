        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose substantial risks to public health, worsened by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that may have a higher transmissibility and reduce vaccine effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on reproduction numbers of SARS-CoV-2 variants and provided pooled estimates for each variant."
