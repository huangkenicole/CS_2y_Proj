        "To assess, if the SARS-CoV-2 mutate in a similar pattern globally or has a specific pattern in any given population.",
        "We report, the insertion of TTT at 11085, which adds an extra amino acid, F to the NSP6 at amino acid position 38. The highest occurrence of TTT insertion at 11,085 position was found in UK derived samples (65.97%). The second and third highest occurrence of the mutation were found in Australia (8.3%) and USA (4.16%) derived samples, respectively. Another important discovery of this study is the C27945T mutation, which translates into the termination of ORF-8 after 17 amino acids, reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 can replicate without the intact ORF-8 protein. We found that the 97% of C27945T mutation of global occurrence, occurred in Europe and the USA derived samples.",
        "Two of the reported mutations (11085TTT insertion and C27945T nonsense), which seemed to reduce Type I interferon response are linked to specific geographical locations of the host and implicate region-specific mutations in the virus. The findings of this study signify that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to adapt differently to different populations."
