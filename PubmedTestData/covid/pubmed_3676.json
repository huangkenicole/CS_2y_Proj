        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel single-stranded RNA virus that has gripped humanity all over. It affects primarily the respiratory system, but is not limited to it, causing widespread involvement of many organ systems. The cases are still rising at an exponential rate and manifold trials are on to test different agents with the hope for potential limitation of spread and control of symptoms. Various classes of drugs have been tried; some with moderate success while many are yet to be proven to be of definite benefit. We have observed that the drugs used in dermatology practice are featured in more than a few of such studies. Here, we wish to highlight the ones that we are familiar with, which has featured at some point, in the management of this very challenging pandemic."
