      "AbstractText": [
        "In the initial few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, two distinct strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified (L and S strain) based on a tightly linked SNP between two widely separated nucleotides at location 8782 (ORF1ab T8517C) and position 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, codon S84L).",
        "A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively.",
        "The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence \u223c90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.",
        "TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution."
