        "As winter is approaching us, the possibility of respiratory tract infection is rising in the current scenario due to the lack of Covid-19 prophylaxis. So no one could be safe until everyone is safe. Researchers are looking for the vaccine to remove the need for social distancing, mask-wearing, and social gathering worldwide. We cannot say about the vaccine's effectiveness if the vaccine is available. Several drugs are being tested to save people's life from the pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin regarding COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that blocks the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mainly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice to those who require broader spectrum antibiotics if we do not use azithromycin. So significant research priority is needed to determine whether azithromycin is useful in the treatment of COVID-19."
