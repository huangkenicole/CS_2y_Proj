      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an enormous impact worldwide, and vaccination is believed to be the method that will control the pandemic. Several types of vaccines developed using different platforms have been authorized, but the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with different vaccines remain largely unclear.",
        "Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, Research Square, and SSRN were searched to investigate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity associated with heterologous vaccination.As of 30 June 2021, four trials including 1,862 participants were identified. Heterologous administration of BNT162b2 (BNT) in ChAdOx1 (ChAd)-primed participants (ChAd/BNT) showed noninferior immunogenicity to homologous BNT administration (both prime and booster were BNT vaccines, BNT/BNT) with tolerable reactogenicity and higher T cell responses. Compared with homologous ChAdOX1 vaccination (ChAd/ChAd), heterologous ChAd/BNT was found to elicit higher immunogenicity (ChAd/BNT vs. ChAd/ChAd, antibody titer ratio: 9.2).",
        "Our systematic review found robust immunogenicity and tolerable reactogenicity of heterologous administration of a BNT162b2 boost in ChAdOx1-primed participants. An additional benefit of stronger T cellular immunity was also observed. Heterologous vaccination is a reasonable and feasible strategy to combat COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to confirm the benefits and identify the optimal combinations, doses, and intervals."
