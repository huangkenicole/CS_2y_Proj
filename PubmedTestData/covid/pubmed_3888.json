        "Appropriate interpretation of various diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is critical, yet the association among rapid antigen tests, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and viral culture has not been fully defined. To determine whether rapid antigen testing correlates with the presence and quantity of replication-competent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in ambulatory adults, 626 adult participants were enrolled in a cross-sectional diagnostic study. Each participant had two anterior nasal swabs obtained for rapid antigen and RT-PCR testing and SARS-CoV-2 viral culture. The primary outcomes were the presence and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 growth in VeroE6-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells in asymptomatic and symptomatic ambulatory adults. In this cross-sectional study of 626 adult outpatients, the sensitivity of a single positive antigen test to identify replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 was 63.6% in asymptomatic and 91.0% in symptomatic participants. Viral culture titers were the highest at the onset of symptoms and rapidly declined by 7\u2009days after symptom onset. The positive agreement of the rapid antigen test with RT-PCR at a cycle threshold <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> less than 30 was 66.7% in asymptomatic and 90.7% in symptomatic participants. Among symptomatic participants a with a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> less than 30, a single antigen test had a positive agreement of 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.8% to 94.8%). There was 100% negative agreement as all 425 RT-PCR-negative participants had a negative antigen test. A positive antigen test in symptomatic adults with COVID-19 has a strong correlation with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. Rapid antigen test results may be a suitable proxy for infectiousness. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Do rapid antigen test results correlate with replication-competent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., infectious) virus? In this cross-sectional diagnostic study of 626 adults, the sensitivity of the antigen test to identify replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 was 63.6% in asymptomatic and 91.0% in symptomatic participants. Viral culture titers were the highest at the onset of symptoms and rapidly declined by 7\u2009days after symptom onset. The positive agreement of the rapid antigen test with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR at a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> of less than 30 was 66.7% in asymptomatic participants and 90.7% in symptomatic participants. A positive antigen test may be an appropriate surrogate for identifying replication-competent virus in symptomatic individuals with COVID-19."
