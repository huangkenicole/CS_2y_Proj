        "Disease progression during SARS-CoV-2 infection is tightly linked to the fate of lung epithelial cells, with severe cases of COVID-19 characterized by direct injury of the alveolar epithelium and an impairment in its regeneration from progenitor cells. The molecular pathways that govern respiratory epithelial cell death and proliferation during SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, remain unclear. We now report a high-throughput CRISPR screen for host genetic modifiers of the survival and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 respiratory epithelial cells. The top four genes identified in our screen encode components of the same type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling complex\u2014<i>IFNAR1</i>, <i>IFNAR2</i>, <i>JAK1</i>, and <i>TYK2</i>. The fifth gene, <i>ACE2</i>, was an expected control encoding the SARS-CoV-2 viral receptor. Surprisingly, despite the antiviral properties of IFN-I signaling, its disruption in our screen was associated with an increase in Calu-3 cell fitness. We validated this effect and found that IFN-I signaling did not sensitize SARS-CoV-2-infected cultures to cell death but rather inhibited the proliferation of surviving cells after the early peak of viral replication and cytopathic effect. We also found that IFN-I signaling alone, in the absence of viral infection, was sufficient to induce this delayed antiproliferative response in both Calu-3 cells and iPSC-derived type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. Together, these findings highlight a cell autonomous antiproliferative response by respiratory epithelial cells to persistent IFN-I signaling during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This response may contribute to the deficient alveolar regeneration that has been associated with COVID-19 lung injury and represents a promising area for host-targeted therapeutic development."
