        "An approach comprising a novel fusion protein and inactivated virus, as a more efficacious vaccine against invading viruses is presented, using SARS-CoV-2 as a most prominent example. The fusion protein consists of the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) conjugated to the N-terminal helix (NTH) of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. For vaccination, this fusion protein is to be administered together with the whole killed virus. The NTH would bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein of the killed virus. Due to HBsAg acting as a decoy, immune responses would be mounted. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) pre-existing in people already vaccinated with the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine, fresh production of NAbs, and NAbs produced by memory B cells would bind to the HBsAg. This would lead to \"presentation\" of the killed virus to elements of the immune system at close range. Also, there would be enhanced opsonization and effective antigen presentation. This two-component vaccine could be a platform strategy, wherein HBsAg could be linked to the part of the cellular receptor that any new intractable virus binds to, and is administered together with whole inactivated virus. Now, the same fusion protein, administered by itself to persons with infection, would have therapeutic action, yet by harnessing elements of the immune system. NAbs would bind to the fusion protein as above, the NTH of which would bind to the RBDs of the infecting virus, which, in effect would be neutralized."
