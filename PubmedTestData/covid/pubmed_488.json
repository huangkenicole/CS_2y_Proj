        "The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the approval of numerous molecular diagnostic assays with various performance and technical capacities. There are limited data comparing performance among assays. We conducted a retrospective analysis of >10,000 test results among three widely used RT-PCR assays for coronavirus disease 2019 (CDC, Simplexa Direct, and TaqPath) to assess performance characteristics. We also retested remnant weakly positive specimens to assess analytical sensitivity. All assays had strong linear correlation and little bias among C<sub>T</sub> values for PCR targets. In patients with first-test negative results (n = 811), most (795, 98.0%) remained negative for all subsequent testing. Retesting of weakly positive specimens (C<sub>T</sub>\u00a0>\u00a030) showed sensitivities as follows: TaqPath (97.8%), CDC (91%), Simplexa (75.3%). Our analysis showed no performance difference among PCR targets within the same assay, suggesting a single target is sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Lower respiratory tract specimens had a higher negative predictive value (100%) than upper respiratory tract specimens (98%), highlighting the utility of testing lower respiratory tract specimens when clinically indicated. Negative predictive value did not increase on further repeated testing, providing strong evidence for discouraging unnecessary repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2."
