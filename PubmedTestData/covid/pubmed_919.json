        "COVID-19 has killed more than 4 million people to date and is the most significant global health problem. The first recorded case of COVID-19 had been noted in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and already on March 11, 2020, World Health Organization declared a pandemic due to the rapid spread of this infection. In addition to the damage to the respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing severe complications that can affect almost all organ systems. Due to the insufficient effectiveness of the COVID-19 therapy, there is an urgent need to develop effective specific medicines. Among the known approaches to the creation of antiviral drugs, a very promising direction is the development of drugs whose action is mediated by the mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). A small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule suppresses the expression of a target gene in this regulatory pathway. The phenomenon of RNAi makes it possible to quickly create a whole series of highly effective antiviral drugs, if the matrix RNA (mRNA) sequence of the target viral protein is known. This review examines the possibility of clinical application of siRNAs aimed at suppressing reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the experience of similar studies using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection models. It is important to remember that the effectiveness of siRNA molecules targeting viral genes may decrease due to the formation of viral resistance. In this regard, the design of siRNAs targeting the cellular factors necessary for the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 deserves special attention."
