        "The recently public health crises in the world is emerged by spreading the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also named COVID-19. The virus is originated in bats and transported to humans via undefined intermediate animals. This virus can produce from weak to severe respiratory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), pneumonia and even death in patients. The COVID-19 disease is distributed by inhalation via contaminated droplets or contact with infected environment. The incubation time is from 2 to 14\u00a0day and the symptoms are typically fever, sore throat, cough, malaise, fatigue, breathlessness among others. It needs to be considered that many infected people are asymptomatic. Developing various immunological and virological methods to diagnose this disease is supported by several laboratories. Treatment is principally supportive; however, there are several agents that are using in treating of COVID-19 patients. Interferons (IFNs) have shown to be crucial in fighting with COVID-19 disease and can be a suitable candidate in treatment of these patients. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy to cure this disease. Prevention necessitates to be performed by isolation of suspected people and home quarantine as well as taking care to infected people with mild or strict disease at hospitals. As the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated, developing effective therapy is an urgent requirement to battle the virus and prevent further pandemic. In this manuscript we reviewed available information about SARS-CoV-2 and probable therapies for COVID-19 patients."
