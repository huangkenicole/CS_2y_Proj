        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contagious pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds, more and more pregnant women are infected with SARS-CoV-2, concerns have been raised about its clinical manifestations in pregnancy and the potential risk of vertical transmission from mother to fetus in pregnant women. Hence, in this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women with COVID-19 and discuss the clinical manifestations, treatments, maternal and perinatal outcomes, and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of such virus. Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other populations and that there is no evidence of vertical transmission from mother to child. In the meantime, considering the good prognosis of most of the infected mothers and infants and absence of serious obstetric complications in pregnant women with COVID-19, it is not recommended to give birth as soon as possible, and it is necessary to extend the gestational period reasonably."
