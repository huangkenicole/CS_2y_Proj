        "The SARS-COV-2 pandemic is a worldwide public health problem due to the large medical burden and limited number of therapies available. Corticosteroids have a rather unclear efficacy in viral non-SARS-COV-2 pneumonias and therefore their use is not universally recommended. In SARS-COV-2 pneumonia however, it is expected that they can reduce the deleterious consequences of the virus-related systemic inflammation.",
        "a MEDLINE search covering the period 1995-2020 was completed to identify relevant papers. SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is very complex and is represented by the interplay of many cytokine-driven inflammation pathways. Its most severe form so called cytokine storm, is an exaggerate reaction of the host infected by the virus rapidly resulting in multiple organ dysfunction (MODS). Corticosteroids have the potential to blunt the inflammation response in such patients, but their efficacy is not the same for all patients. Further on the certainties and uncertainties regarding the efficacy of this therapy in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia are discussed.",
        "In patients with severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, corticosteroids can be efficacious, but it is still not clear if they can be safely used in patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease or how the optimal duration of therapy can be established."
