        "The 2020 pandemic has transformed the world and elicited thousands of studies to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Viral load has been a common measure to monitor treatment therapies and associate viral dynamics with patient outcomes; however, methods associated with viral load have varied across studies. These variations have the potential to sacrifice the accuracy of findings as they often do not account for inter-assay variation or variation across samples. In a retrospective study of nasopharyngeal samples, we found a significant amount of variation within the DNA and RNA targets; for example, across time within a single patient, there was an average of a 32-fold change. Further, we explore the impacts of host normalization on 94 clinical samples using the TGen Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 assay, finding that without host normalization samples with the same viral concentration can have up to 100-fold variation in the viral load."
