      "AbstractText": [
        "A simple, selective, and quantitative platform for point-of-care diagnostic of COVID-19 is urgently needed as a complement in areas where resources are currently relatively scarce. To meet the needs of early diagnosis and intervention, a proof-of-concept demonstration of a universal personal glucose meter-based nucleic acid assay platform (PGM-NAAP) is presented, which converts to SARS-CoV-2 detection from glucose detection. By using magnetic bead separation together with the hand-held PGM for quantitative readout, PGM-NAAP achieves the 98 pM limit of detection for a sequence related to SARS-CoV-2. The ability to discriminate target nucleic acid from genomic DNA, the satisfactory spike recoveries of saliva and serum samples, as well as the good stability all together suggest the potential of the PGM-NAAP for the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients during the outbreaks of COVID-19 in resource-limited settings without sophisticated instruments. On the basis of these findings, PGM-NAAP can be expected to provide an accurate and convenient path for diagnosis of disease-associated nucleic acid."
