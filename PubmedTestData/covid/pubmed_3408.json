        "Rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are essential to interrupt outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. However, the most commonly used nucleic acid detection method, qPCR or RT-qPCR, takes several hours to complete and requires highly sophisticated equipment. Recently, an emerging nucleic acid detection method based on the CRISPR/Cas system has reduced the reliance on qPCR. It has several important features that make it suitable for on-site POCT (point-of-care testing), including short detection cycles, low cost, high sensitivity, and the ability to be combined with different readout methods. This review briefly introduces the steps of CRISPR/Cas detection and then summarizes the current advances of CRISPR/Cas-based POCT from four steps: nucleic acid extraction, target amplification, CRISPR/Cas-based signal generation, and signal output. Finally, we discuss the advantages and challenges of CRISPR-based POCT and describe the future research perspectives for CRISPR."
