        "The Alinity m (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) automated molecular analyzer allows continuous loading of samples and sample-to-result molecular detection of several microorganisms. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by the Alinity m was compared with that of the cobas 6800 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ; standard comparator) in a manufacturer-independent clinical evaluation on 2157 consecutive nasopharyngeal swab samples. Valid initial results on Alinity m and cobas 6800 were obtained from 2129 (98.7%) and 2157 (100%) samples, respectively. The overall percent agreement (95% CI) was 98.3% (2092/2129 [97.6%-98.7%]); positive percent agreement, 100% (961/961 [99.6%-100%]); negative percent agreement, 96.8% (1131/1168 [95.7%-97.7%]); and high \u03ba value, 0.965 (0.954-0.976). There were 37 discordant results on Alinity m and, based on discordant analyses, including previous and/or follow-up PCR results, 22 could be considered analytically true positive with high probability. Due to a lack of additional information and an inability to perform repeated/further testing, the status of the remaining 15 discordant results remained unresolved. The throughput of the two analyzers was compared using testing on 564 samples in parallel across two 8-hour shifts in clinical practice. The turnaround times were compared using processing of 94 routine samples in parallel on each working day for 5 consecutive days. The two analyzers showed similar performance, with certain differences that have potential importance in some laboratory settings."
