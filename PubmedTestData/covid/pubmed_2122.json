      "AbstractText": [
        "From April to September 2020, Poland was minimally affected by COVID-19 compared to other EU countries. We aimed to investigate the risks of false reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results during the first wave (compared to later waves), that rises when cycle threshold (Ct) of positive result is close to limit of detection (LOD).",
        "We analyzed Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR results of 7726 patients in Poland from April-September 2020. SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR results of 14,534 patients in the 2nd-3rd wave and 10,861 patients in the 4th-5th pandemic waves were used. Statistical analysis was based on one-way analysis of variance. To verify, 95% confidence intervals with Bonferroni correction were computed. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Poland was analyzed using Whole Genome Sequencing from 923 (3.6%) patients.",
        "The mean Ct of RT-PCR positive test results analyzed ranged between 22.89 and 26.71 depending on the month of the results collection. The differences between months were significant (p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). Differences in Ct were observed between age groups, with younger patients displaying higher Ct values, however, major trends over time were paralleled between age groups.",
        "The mean Ct of the tested RT-PCR positive test results was lower than 35 which is considered an upper borderline for reliable positive results of the assay. Therefore, most COVID-19 cases recorded in Poland from April to September 2020 were detected with minor risks of inaccuracy. Data from a single center exhibited greater consistency for both virus Ct level and SARS-CoV-2 virus variant identification."
