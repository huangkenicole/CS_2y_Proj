      "AbstractText": [
        "Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit impaired IFN-I response due to decreased IFN-\u03b2 production, allowing persistent viral load and exacerbated inflammation. While the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein has been implicated in inhibiting innate immunity by interfering with IFN-\u03b2 signaling, the specific underlying mechanism still needs further investigation for a comprehensive understanding. This study reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein enhances interaction between the human SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 and MAVS. Increased MAVS-UBC9 interaction leads to enhanced SUMOylation of MAVS, inhibiting its ubiquitination, resulting in the inhibition of phosphorylation events involving IKK\u03b1, TBK1, and IRF3, thus disrupting IFN-\u03b2 signaling. This study highlights the role of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating the innate immune response by affecting the MAVS SUMOylation and ubiquitination processes, leading to inhibition of the IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway. These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to manipulate the host's antiviral defenses and provide potential insights for developing targeted therapeutic strategies against severe COVID-19."
