        "Nowadays, Covid-19 is considered a serious health problem worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that has sparked a global pandemic of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). It is well known that the Corona Virus attacks mainly the respiratory system. Meanwhile, it has been established that coronavirus infection can extend beyond the respiratory system and unfortunately, can also affect our nervous system. Multiple neurological symptoms and signs had been documented during and post covid conditions. This virus gets access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the bloodstream leading to infect the endothelial lining cells. Also, it was reported that the virus can enter the peripheral nervous system via retrograde neuronal routes. The virus could be internalized in nerve synapses through endocytosis, transported retrogradely, and spread trans-synoptically to other brain regions. This minireview highlights the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and its pathophysiology and manifestation."
