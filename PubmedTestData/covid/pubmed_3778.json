        "Positive nucleic acid (NA) results have been found in recovered and discharged COVID-19 patients, but the proportion is unclear. This study was designed to analyze the recurrent positive rate of NA results after consecutively negative results, and the relationship between the specific antibody production and positive NA rate. According to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, data of inpatients in Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Jan. 28 and Mar. 6, 2020 were collected. A total of 564 COVID-19 patients over 14 years old who received the examinations of NA and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were included. Days of viral shedding and specific antibodies were recorded and assessed. Among NA tests in respiratory samples (throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and flushing fluid in alveoli), the patients with all-negative NA results accounted for 17.20%, those with single-positive results for 46.63%, and those with multiple-positive results for 36.17% respectively. Besides, the recurrent positive NA results after consecutively negative results appeared in 66 patients (11.70%). For multiple-positive patients, median viral shedding duration was 20 days (range: 1 to 57 days). Of the 205 patients who received 2 or more antibody tests, 141 (68.78%) had decreased IgG and IgM concentrations. IgM decreased to normal range in 24 patients, with a median of 44 days from symptom onset. Viral shedding duration was not significantly correlated with gender, age, disease severity, changes in pulmonary imaging, and antibody concentration. It is concluded that antibody level and antibody change had no significant correlation with the positive rate of NA tests and the conversion rate after continuous negative NA tests. In order to reduce the recurrent positive proportion after discharge, 3 or more consecutive negative NA test results with test interval more than 24 h every time are suggested for the discharge or release from quarantine."
