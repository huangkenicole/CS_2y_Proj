        "SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic has created an unprecedented medical and economic crisis all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 is found to have more contagious character as compared to MERS-CoV and is spreading in a very fast manner all around the globe. It has affected over 31 million people all over the world till date. This virus shares around 80% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV. In this perspective, we have explored three major targets namely; SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and 3CL or M<sup>pro</sup> Protease for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. These targets have attracted attention of the medicinal chemists working on computer-aided drug design in developing new small molecules that might inhibit these targets for combating COVID-19 disease. Moreover, we have compared the similarity of these target proteins with earlier reported coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We have observed that both the coronaviruses share around 80% similarity in their amino acid sequence. The key amino acid interactions which can play a crucial role in designing new small molecule inhibitors against COVID-19 have been reported in this perspective. Authors believe that this study will help the medicinal chemists to understand the key amino acids essential for interactions at the active site of target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, based on their similarity with earlier reported viruses. In this review, we have also described the lead molecules under various clinical trials for their efficacy against COVID-19."
