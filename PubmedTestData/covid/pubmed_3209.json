      "AbstractText": [
        "To provide guidance to nurses caring for individuals with COVID-19, we developed linkages using interoperable standardized nursing terminologies: NANDA International (NANDA-I) nursing diagnoses, Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), and Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC). We also identified potential new NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions for future development related to nurses' role during a pandemic.",
        "Using a consensus process, seven nurse experts created the linkages for individuals during the COVID 19 pandemic using the following steps: (a) creating an initial list of potential nursing diagnoses, (b) selecting and categorizing outcomes that aligned with all components of each nursing diagnosis selected, and (c) identifying relevant nursing interventions.",
        "A total of 16 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses were identified as the foundation for the linkage work, organized in two dimensions, physiological and psychosocial. A total of 171 different NOC outcomes were identified to guide care based on the nursing diagnoses and 96 NIC interventions were identified as suggested interventions. A total of 13 proposed concepts were identified for potential future development across the three classifications.",
        "The linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions developed in this article provide a guide to enhance nursing practice and determine the effectiveness of nurses' contribution to patient outcomes for individuals at risk for or infected by COVID-19.",
        "NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC linkages identified in this paper are an important example of the value of using standardized nursing terminologies to guide and document nursing care. When included in electronic health record databases and used widely, the data generated from the care plans can be used to create new knowledge about how to better improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19."
