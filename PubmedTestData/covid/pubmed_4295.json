      "AbstractText": [
        "Although mRNA-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines report >90% efficacy, breakthrough infections occur. Little is known about their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the highly prevalent B.1.427/B.1.429 variant.",
        "In this quality improvement project, we collected demographic and clinical information from post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases (PVSCs), defined as healthcare personnel (HCP) with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test after receiving \u22651 vaccine dose. Available specimens were tested for L452R, N501Y, and E484K mutations using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mutation prevalence was compared among unvaccinated, early post-vaccinated (\u226414 days after dose 1), partially vaccinated (positive test >14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2), and fully vaccinated (>14 days after dose 2) PVSCs.",
        "From December 2020 to April 2021, \u226523\u2009090 HCP received \u22651 dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 660 HCP cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred, of which 189 were PVSCs. Among the PVSCs, 114 (60.3%), 49 (25.9%), and 26 (13.8%) were early post-vaccination, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively. Of 261 available samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated HCP, 103 (39.5%), including 42 PVSCs (36.5%), had the L452R mutation presumptive of B.1.427/B.1.429. When adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427/B.1.429, PVSCs did not have significantly elevated risk of B.1.427/B.1.429 compared with unvaccinated HCP.",
        "Most PVSCs occurred prior to expected onset of full, vaccine-derived immunity. Presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429 was not more prevalent in post-vaccine cases than in unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 HCP. Continued infection control measures, particularly <14 days post-vaccination, and continued variant surveillance in PVSCs are imperative to control future SARS-CoV-2 surges."
