        "<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the production of potential antivirals and vaccines from research organizations across the globe. The initial step for all drug discovery models is the identification of suitable targets. One approach organizations may take to tackle this involves issuing raw data publicly for collaboration with other organizations in order to spark discussion, collectively experiment and stay up to date with advances in scientific knowledge. <b>Areas covered:</b> Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs. <b>Expert opinion:</b> A case can be made for both open and closed drug discovery models; however, due to the rapidly evolving nature of this deadly virus, organizations should collate their research and support one another to ensure satisfactory treatment can be approved in a timely manner."
