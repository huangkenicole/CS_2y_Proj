      "AbstractText": [
        "Mounting evidence demonstrates potential for fecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The US Food and Drug Administration now requires SARS-CoV-2 testing of potential feces donors before the use of stool manufactured for fecal microbiota transplantation. We sought to develop and validate a high-sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure for testing stool specimens.",
        "A modified extraction method was used with an RT-PCR assay adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PCR protocol for respiratory specimens. Contrived specimens were created using pre-COVID-19 banked stool specimens and spiking in known concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific nucleic acid. The highest transcript concentration at which 2/2 or 1/2 SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected in 9/10 replicates was defined as the dual-target limit and single-target limit of detection, respectively. The clinical performance of the assay was evaluated with stool samples collected from 17 nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR-positive patients and 14 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR-negative patients.",
        "The dual-target and single-target limit of detection were 56 copies/\u03bcL and 3 copies/\u03bcL, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was detected at concentrations as low as 0.6 copies/\u03bcL. Clinical stool samples from known COVID-19-positive patients demonstrated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool up to 29 days from symptom onset with a high agreement with nasopharyngeal swab tests (kappa statistic of 0.95, P value < 0.001).",
        "The described RT-PCR test is a sensitive and flexible approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool specimens. We propose an integrated screening approach that incorporates this stool test to support continuation of fecal microbiota transplantation programs."
