        "There is a significant body of evidence showing that efficient vaccination schemes against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is helping control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, this goal cannot be achieved without real world data highlighting the impact of vaccines against viral spread. In this study, we have aimed at differentially investigating the impact of COVID-19 vaccines (CoronaVac, Pfizer/BioNTech, Astra/Zeneca Oxford, Janssen) used in North Cyprus in limiting the viral load of Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-COV-2. We have utilized real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction\u00a0cycle threshold values (Ct values) as a proxy of viral load of the two SARS-CoV-2 variants.\u00a0Our results indicate that the administration of at least two doses of the messenger RNA-based Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine leads to the lowest viral load (highest Ct values) obtained for both Omicron and Delta variants. Interestingly, regardless of the vaccine type used, our study revealed that Delta variant produced significantly higher viral loads (lower Ct values) compared with\u00a0the Omicron variant, where the latter was more commonly associated with younger patients. Viral spread is a crucial factor that can help determine the future of the pandemic. Thus, prioritizing vaccines that will play a role in not only preventing severe disease but also in limiting viral load and spread may contribute to infection control strategies."
