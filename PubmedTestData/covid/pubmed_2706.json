        "Cardiac consequences occur in both\u00a0acute COVID-19\u00a0and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here, we highlight the current understanding about COVID-19 cardiac effects, based upon clinical, imaging, autopsy, and\u00a0molecular studies.",
        "COVID-19 cardiac effects are heterogeneous. Multiple, concurrent cardiac histopathologic findings have been detected on autopsies of\u00a0COVID-19 non-survivors. Microthrombi and cardiomyocyte necrosis are commonly detected. Macrophages often infiltrate the heart at high density but without fulfilling\u00a0histologic criteria for myocarditis. The high prevalences of microthrombi and inflammatory infiltrates in fatal COVID-19 raise the concern that recovered COVID-19 patients may have similar but subclinical cardiac pathology. Molecular studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiac pericytes, dysregulated immunothrombosis, and pro-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic responses underlie COVID-19 cardiac pathology. The extent and nature by which mild COVID-19 affects the heart is unknown. Imaging and epidemiologic studies of recovered COVID-19 patients suggest that even mild illness confers increased risks of cardiac inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, and cardiovascular death. The mechanistic details of COVID-19 cardiac pathophysiology remain under active investigation. The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vast numbers of recovered COVID-19 patients portend a burgeoning global cardiovascular disease burden. Our ability to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease in the future will likely depend on comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 cardiac pathophysiologic phenotypes."
