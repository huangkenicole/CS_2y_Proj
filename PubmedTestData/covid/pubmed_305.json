      "AbstractText": [
        "The epidemic due to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global concern, posing a severe threat to the health of populations. At present, all countries in the world are stepping up the development of vaccines and antiviral agents to prevent the infection and further transmission of SARS-CoV-2. An in-depth investigation of the target organs and pathogenesis regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection will be beneficial for virus therapy. Besides pulmonary injury, SARS-CoV-2 also causes cardiac injury, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. This review summarizes the essential structural characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), describes the cardiac manifestations following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and explores the mechanisms of cardiac injury targeting ACE2 after the viral invasion. We aim to help the timely detection of related symptoms and implementation of therapeutic measures by clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
