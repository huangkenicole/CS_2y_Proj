      "AbstractText": [
        "Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily manifests in the form of respiratory symptoms, emerging evidence suggests that the disease is associated with numerous neurological complications, such as stroke and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Hence, further research is necessary to seek possible therapeutic targets in the CNS for effective management of these complications.",
        "This review examines the neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible routes of infection. It progresses to illuminate the possible therapeutic targets for effective management of these neuromodulatory effects and the repurposing of drugs that could serve this purpose. To this end, literature from the year 1998-2021 was derived from PubMed.",
        "The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 may be related to poor prognosis and higher comorbidity. Identification of the key molecular targets in the brain that are potential indicators of the observed neuropathology, such as inflammatory mediators and chromatin modifiers, is key. The repurposing of existing drugs to target potential candidates could reduce the mortality attributed to these associated neurological complications."
