      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease caused by a highly contagious virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this disease has affected millions of people across the world and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection.",
        "We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19."
