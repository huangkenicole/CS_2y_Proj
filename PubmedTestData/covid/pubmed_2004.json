        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus\u20112 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) poses a threat to human life worldwide. Since early March,\u00a02020, coronavirus disease\u00a02019\u00a0(COVID\u201119), characterized by an acute and often severe form of pneumonia, has been declared a pandemic. This has led to a boom in biomedical research studies at all stages of the pipeline, from the in\u00a0vitro to the clinical phase. In line with this global effort, known drugs, currently used for the treatment of other pathologies, including antivirals, immunomodulating compounds and antibodies, are currently used off\u2011label for the treatment of COVID\u201119, in association with the supportive standard care. Yet, no effective treatments have been identified. A new hope stems from medical oncology and relies on the use of immune\u2011checkpoint inhibitors\u00a0(ICIs). In particular, amongst the ICIs, antibodies able to block the programmed death\u20111\u00a0(PD\u20111)/PD ligand-1\u00a0(PD\u2011L1) pathway have revealed a hidden potential. In fact, patients with severe and critical COVID\u201119, even prior to the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome, exhibit lymphocytopenia and suffer from T\u2011cell exhaustion, which may lead to viral sepsis and an increased mortality rate. It has been observed that cancer patients, who usually are immunocompromised, may restore their anti\u2011tumoral immune response when treated with ICIs. Moreover, viral-infected mice and humans, exhibit a T\u2011cell exhaustion, which is also observed following SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection. Importantly, when treated with anti\u2011PD\u20111 and anti\u2011PD\u2011L1 antibodies, they restore their T\u2011cell competence and efficiently counteract the viral infection. Based on these observations, four clinical trials are currently open, to examine the efficacy of anti\u2011PD\u20111 antibody administration to both cancer and non\u2011cancer individuals affected by COVID\u201119. The results may prove the hypothesis that restoring exhausted T\u2011cells may be a winning strategy to beat SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection."
