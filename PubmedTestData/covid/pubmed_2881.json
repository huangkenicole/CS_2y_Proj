        "Infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is critically connected with host metabolism. Through functional enrichment analysis, the present study aims to evaluate the biological processes involving host proteins interfered by SARS-CoV-2 to verify the potential metabolic impact of the infection. Furthermore, tissue enrichment analyses and differential gene expression of host proteins were applied to understand the interference by SARS-CoV-2 on tissue levels. Results based on functional and tissue-specific enrichment analyses, presented in this study, suggest that SARS-CoV-2, mediated interference on host proteins, can affect the metabolism and catabolism of molecular building blocks and control intracellular mechanisms, including gene expression in metabolism-related organs, to support viral demands. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can broadly affect the host metabolism and catabolism at tissue and physiological levels contributing to a more severe disease."
