        "Up to 10-20% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a severe pulmonary disease due to immune dysfunction and cytokine dysregulation. However, the extracellular proteomic characteristics in respiratory tract of these critical COVID-19 patients still remain to be investigated. In the present study, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with critical COVID-19 and from non-COVID-19 controls. Our study identified 358 differentially expressed BALF proteins (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), among which 41 were significantly changed after using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (q\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The up-regulated signaling was found to be mainly involved in inflammatory signaling and response to oxidative stress. A series of increased extracellular factors including Tenascin-C (TNC), Mucin-1 (KL-6 or MUC1), Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), periostin (POSTN), Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40), and S100A12, and the antigens including lymphocyte antigen 6D/E48 antigen (LY6D), CD9 antigen, CD177 antigen, and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) were identified, among which the proinflammatory factors TNC and KL-6 were further validated in serum of another thirty-nine COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, showing high potentials of being biomarkers or therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. This BALF proteome associated with COVID-19 would also be a valuable resource for researches on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechanisms of host response.
