        "To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott ID-NOW\u2122 test in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The test is based on the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 gene by isothermal amplification technology.",
        "From 303 individuals, two nasopharyngeal swabs and one oropharyngeal swab were collected to be tested in parallel by the ID-NOW\u2122 test and PCR test (Allplex\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 Assay). A subgroup of 107 individuals presented to the public collection point for covid-19 at the Motol University Hospital during the dominance of the Delta variant, and the others were tested via the Adult Emergency Admission Department during the dominance of the Omicron variant.",
        "Of 297 valid samples, 43 were positive by the PCR assay and 33 were positive by the ID-NOW\u2122 test (sensitivity 76.74%; 95% CI 61.37 to 88.24%). ID-NOW\u2122 detected three samples as positive, but the positivity was not confirmed by PCR (specificity 98.82%; 95% CI 96.59 to 99.76%). A significant increase in sensitivity up to 100% is observed for samples with a higher viral load (with a PCR threshold cycle value below 30 or from patients with symptoms of COVID-19). The Delta or Omicron variant has no significant effect on the sensitivity of the test.",
        "Due to its ease of use and speed of result, ID-NOW\u2122 is a suitable diagnostic tool for prompt assessment of a patient's infectivity. If, despite the negative ID-NOW\u2122 result, the patient has symptoms of COVID-19, it is advised to perform a classic PCR test for SARS-CoV-2."
