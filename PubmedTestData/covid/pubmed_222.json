        "Throughout the viral life cycle, interplays between cellular host factors and virus determine the infectious capacity of the virus. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great threat to human life and health. Extensive studies identified a number of host proviral and antiviral factors for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and cellular factors during virus entry and replication. Our review will highlight the future direction of study on the infection and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, as well as novel therapeutic strategies and effective antiviral targets for COVID-19."
