        "Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, the international community has been concerned about the emergence of mutations altering some biological properties of the pathogen like increasing its infectivity or virulence. Particularly, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). However, the existing mechanism of detecting important mutations are not always effective enough, since only a relatively small part of all pathogen samples can be examined by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost.",
        "In this study, we have designed special primer panel and used it for targeted highthroughput sequencing of several significant S-gene (spike) regions of SARS-CoV-2. The Illumina platform averaged approximately 50,000 paired-end reads with a length of \u2265150 bp per sample. This method was used to examine 579 random samples obtained from COVID-19 patients in Moscow and the Moscow region from February to June 2021.",
        "This study demonstrated the dynamics of distribution of several SARS-CoV-2 strains and its some single mutations. It was found that the Delta strain appeared in the region in May 2021, and became prevalent in June, partially displacing other strains.",
        "The obtained results provide an opportunity to assign the viral samples to one of the strains, including the previously mentioned in time- and cost-effective manner. The approach can be used for standardization of the procedure of searching for mutations in individual regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. It allows to get a more detailed data about the epidemiological situation in a region."
