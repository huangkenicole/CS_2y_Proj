        "Globally, over 650 million people have had COVID-19 due to infection with the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Cardiac complications in the acute infectious and early recovery phase were recognized early in the pandemic, including myocardial injury and inflammation. With a decrease in the number of acute COVID-19 related deaths, there has been increased interest in postacute sequela of COVID-19 (PASC) and other longer-term cardiovascular complications. A proportion of patients recovered from COVID-19 have persistent cardiac symptoms and are at risk of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular imaging, including MRI, plays an important role in the detection of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 in both the acute and longer-term phases after COVID-19. The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of cardiovascular imaging in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with acute and chronic cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 with a focus on cardiac MRI. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 3."
