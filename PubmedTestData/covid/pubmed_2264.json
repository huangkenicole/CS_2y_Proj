        "With a large population most susceptible to Omicron and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, China faces uncertain scenarios if reopening its border. Thus, we aimed to predict the impact of combination preventative interventions on hospitalization and death. An age-stratified susceptible-infectious-quarantined-hospitalized-removed-susceptible (SIQHRS) model based on the new guidelines of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment (the ninth edition) was constructed to simulate the transmission dynamics of Omicron within 365 days. At baseline, we assumed no interventions other than 60% booster vaccination in individuals aged \u226460 years and 80% in individuals aged >60 years, quarantine and hospitalization. Oral antiviral medications for COVID-19 and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and antigen self-testing were considered in subsequent scenarios. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to reflect different levels of interventions. A total of 0.73 billion cumulative quarantines (95% CI 0.53-0.83), 33.59 million hospitalizations (22.41-39.31), and 0.62 million deaths (0.40-0.75) are expected in 365 days. The case fatality rate with pneumonia symptoms (moderate, severe and critical illness) is expected to be 1.83% (1.68-1.99%) and the infected fatality rate is 0.38\u2030 (0.33-0.4\u2030). The highest existing hospitalization and ICU occupations are 3.11 (0.30-3.85) and 20.33 (2.01-25.20) times of capacity, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that interventions can be adjusted to meet certain conditions to reduce the total number of infections and deaths. In conclusion, after sufficient respiratory and ICU beds are prepared and the relaxed NPIs are in place, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant would not seriously impact the health system."
