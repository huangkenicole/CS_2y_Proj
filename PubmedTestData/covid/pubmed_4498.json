        "To assess the clinical impact of respiratory virus codetections among children hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.",
        "During March 2020 to February 2022, the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) identified 4372 children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted primarily for fever, respiratory illness, or presumed COVID-19. We compared demographics, clinical features, and outcomes between those with and without codetections who had any non-SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. Among a subgroup of 1670 children with complete additional viral testing, we described the association between presence of codetections and severe respiratory illness using age-stratified multivariable logistic regression models.",
        "Among 4372 children hospitalized, 62% had non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus testing, of which 21% had a codetection. Children with codetections were more likely to be <5 years old (yo), receive increased oxygen support, or be admitted to the ICU (P < .001). Among children <5 yo, having any viral codetection (<2 yo: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.0]; 2-4 yo: aOR 1.9 [95% CI 1.2-3.1]) or rhinovirus/enterovirus codetection (<2 yo: aOR 2.4 [95% CI 1.6-3.7]; 2-4: aOR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]) was significantly associated with severe illness. Among children <2 yo, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) codetections were also significantly associated with severe illness (aOR 1.9 [95% CI 1.3-2.9]). No significant associations were seen among children \u22655 yo.",
        "Respiratory virus codetections, including RSV and rhinovirus/enterovirus, may increase illness severity among children <5 yo hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
