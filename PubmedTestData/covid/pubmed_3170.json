      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly swept across the world. As new knowledge regarding treatment options for COVID-19 has emerged, the use of ozone therapy in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection as an integrative therapeutic option supplementary to standard treatment regimen has been assessed in the present literature. We reviewed, critically analyzed, and summarized all present published literature on ozone therapy in association with COVID-19 via the PubMed database. Various reports and studies on the use of ozone (major autohemotherapy, rectal ozone insufflation, ozone inhalation) in patients affected by COVID-19 indicate that ozone therapy may reduce morbidity and accelerate recovery, while exhibiting a high safety profile with no relevant adverse effects. Current literature suggests that integrating ozone therapy into the existing standard of care and best available therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients offers major advantages in terms of superior clinical outcome parameters and amelioration of laboratory results. Further prospective studies are warranted to guide the next steps in the clinical application of ozone therapy and examine its impact on the course of COVID-19."
