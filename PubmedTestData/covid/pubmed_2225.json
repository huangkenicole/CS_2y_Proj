        "To inform about the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, a literature review was carried out, using the descriptors \"COVID-19,\" \"SARS-CoV-2,\" \"Oncology,\" and \"Coronavirus,\" in the Pubmed, Sciencedirect, and Scifinder databases. Fifty-three articles were included after analyzing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, being divided into five sessions: Epidemiological aspects of COVID-19; Pathophysiology of COVID-19; Clinical aspects of cancer patients; Risks to cancer patients infected with COVID-19; and Care for cancer patients amid a pandemic. The cancer patient has a weakened immune system, due to characteristics specific to the development of cancer or even chemotherapy, leaving these patients more susceptible to infections by COVID-19. Thus, the development of protection plans for cancer patients should be encouraged, reducing the exposure of these patients to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, contributing to the maintenance of the health of the cancer patient, and avoiding possible therapeutic complications that can lead the patient to death."
