        "Neurological features have now been reported very frequently in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. The neurological deficits associated features are observed in both acute and chronic stages of COVID-19 and they appear to overlap with wide-ranging symptoms that can be attributed to being of non-neural origins, thus obscuring the definitive diagnosis of neuro-COVID. The pathogenetic factors acting in concert to cause neuronal injury are now emerging, with SARS-CoV-2 directly affecting the brain coupled with the neuroinflammatory factors have been implicated in the causation of disabilities in acute COVID-19 and patients with Long-COVID syndrome. As the differentiation between a neural origin and other organ-based causation of a particular neurological feature is of prognostic significance, it implores a course of action to this covert, yet important neurological challenge."
