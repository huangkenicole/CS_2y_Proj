        "The concept of going 'green' and 'cold' has led to utilizing renewable resources for the synthesis of microbial biosurfactants that are both patient and eco-friendly. In this review, we shed light on the potential and regulatory aspects of biosurfactants in pharmaceutical applications and how they can significantly contribute to novel concepts for the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and future treatment. We emphasize that more specific guidelines should be formulated to regulate the approval of biosurfactants for human use. It is also crucial to implement a risk-based approach from the early research and development (R&D) phase in addition to establishing more robust standardized techniques and assays to evaluate the characteristics of biosurfactants."
