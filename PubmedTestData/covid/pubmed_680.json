        "Demands to address the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly surpassed global resources. Successful implementation of application technology resulting in people taking greater control of their own health and medical and public health personnel improving efficiency was requested by authorities in Thailand to reduce the demand on health resources to meet the health needs of the people. This paper examines the creation and implementation of three real-time application technologies using a bottom-up approach in an attempt to examine COVID-19 challenges and highlight control measures. These lessons learned represent participatory action research methods involving the people who were responsible for taking actions to improve their own and their communities' health. The objective was to build participation of users, academics and service organizations in a novel technology enhanced system leading to quality management of the COVID-19 pandemic. A new technology enhanced system for medical field personnel encouraged network participation resulting in co-creation of a health data center. Application technology assisted COVID-19 infected patients and high-risk people to identify their own symptoms and to provide a rapid tracking method that could be employed until public health surveillance was achieved. A patient and hospital management system employing new application technology was effective in monitoring COVID-19 patients utilizing an interconnected hospital network. Application technology was beneficial in promoting health, enhancing patient satisfaction, reducing readmission rates and extending health resources."
