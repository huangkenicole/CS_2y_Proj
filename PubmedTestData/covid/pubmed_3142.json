        "Machine learning was shown to be effective at identifying distinctive genomic signatures among viral sequences. These signatures are defined as pervasive motifs in the viral genome that allow discrimination between species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of these signatures can assist in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, improve in the recognition and definition of emerging variants, and aid in the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. In this paper, we assess KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine-learning kernel, to identify multiple genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE was more effective at identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized using a new extension of KEVOLVE (KANALYZER) to highlight variations of the discriminative signatures among different classes of variants, their genomic location, and the mutations involved. The majority of identified signatures were associated with known mutations among the different variants, in terms of functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Here we showed that KEVOLVE is a robust machine learning approach to identify discriminative signatures among SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are frequently also biologically relevant, while bypassing multiple sequence alignments.
