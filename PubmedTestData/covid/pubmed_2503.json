        "In December 2019, a large number of coronavirus cases were emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and rapidly spread to different countries and territories around the world within four months. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak as a global health emergency. The spread of COVID-19 over globe is highly contagious; they transmitted from person-to-person through small droplets of infected person. Many diagnosis and treatment methods have been implemented to reduce and control the outbreak. Efforts have been made to develop coronavirus vaccine against S protein or spike glycoprotein of coronavirus. COVID-19 outbreak will affect the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the world. At the time of preparing manuscript, total number of active cases reaches to more than 8.9 million and confirmed death reaches to approx. 4.6 lakh. This article highlights the ongoing research and advances in designing vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19 and also focusing on the epidemiology, transmission, future direction and control the spread of infectious diseases."
