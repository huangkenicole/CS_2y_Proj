        "Aims To review the evidence regarding the possibility of fetal vertical transmission in COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers by diagnosing through placental swabs. Methods The search terms 'pregnant COVID-19 positive mothers', 'fetal vertical transmission' and 'placental swabs' were used. 20 papers were selected. Results 183 COVID-19 positive pregnant women were identified whose 184 placentas and 185 neonates were also analysed by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (one case of monochorionic diamniotic twins and one case of dichorionic diamniotic twins). 183 liveborn neonates were successfully delivered primarily via caesarean section (99%). 2 mothers did not deliver liveborn infants due to severe preeclampsia resulting in a termination of pregnancy and a miscarriage, both occurring in the second trimester. 9 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (5%). We report no neonatal mortality after live birth and no maternal mortality. 17 placentas tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 out of a total of 184 tested (9%). Of these 17, 7 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in the maternal, neonatal and placental tissue. Conclusion There is no concrete evidence of vertical transmission occurring between mother and infant. We propose further research investigating the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women by using RT-PCR to test the mother, placenta, vaginal fluid, breast milk and infant for SARS-CoV-2 at various stages of transmission."
