        "The implications of the menstrual cycle for disease susceptibility, development, and severity of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are largely unknown. Here, we describe two women infected with SARS-CoV-2 whose real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and symptoms changed during the menstrual cycle. The first patient developed a fever on the first day of her menstrual period, and again on the first day of her next menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were positive during the first menstrual period before admission, but turned negative during hospitalization, and then were positive again during the second menstrual period after hospital discharge. Another one also developed a fever again on the first day of her menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were negative before admission and during hospitalization, but turned positive during the first menstrual period after hospital discharge. The cases indicate sex hormones may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For women with history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the management protocol should include assessment of the menstrual status."
