        "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved into new strains that increase viral transmissibility and reduce vaccine protection. The rapid circulation of these more harmful strains across the globe has created a pressing need for alternative public health screening tools. REVEALR (RNA-encoded viral nucleic acid analytic reporter), a rapid and highly sensitive DNAzyme-based detection system, functions with perfect accuracy against patient-derived clinical samples. Here, we design REVEALR into a novel genotyping assay that detects single-base mismatches corresponding to each of the major SARS-CoV-2 strains found in the United States. Of 34 sequence-verified patient samples collected in early, mid, and late 2021 at the UCI Medical Center in Orange, California, REVEALR identified the correct variant [Wuhan-Hu-1, alpha (B.1.1.7), gamma (P.1), epsilon (B.1.427/9), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529)] with 100% accuracy. The assay, which is programmable and amenable to multiplexing, offers an important new approach to personalized diagnostics."
