        "To discuss the clinical experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hematopoietic cell transplant and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy recipients over the past year and to identify key knowledge gaps for future research.",
        "Immunocompromised individuals and those with chronic health conditions are especially susceptible to infections, which have had a disproportionate impact on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies have evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of transplant and cellular therapy (TCT) recipients who developed COVID-19. Age, sex, comorbid conditions, and social determinants of health are important predictors of the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and of the eventual severity of the disease. Various treatment approaches have been investigated over the last year. The paradigm of management strategies continues to evolve as more experience is accumulated.",
        "In this review, we summarize some important findings as they relate to the clinical characteristics of TCT recipients who develop COVID-19. We also discuss some treatment approaches that are currently recommended and opine on vaccination in this population."
