        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), causing the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was introduced by WHO (World Health Organization) as \"pandemic\" in March 2020. According to WHO, thus far (23 November 2020) 58,425,681 infected cases including 1,385,218 deaths have been reported worldwide. In order to reduce transmission and spread of this lethal virus, attempts are globally being made to develop an appropriate vaccine. Intending to neutralize pathogens at their initial entrance site, protective mucosal immunity is inevitably required. In SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission, respiratory mucosa plays a key role; hence, apparently mucosal vaccination could be a superior approach to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses simultaneously. In this review, the advantages of mucosal vaccination to control COVID-19 infection, limitations, and outcomes of mucosal vaccines have been highlighted. Considering the gut microbiota dysregulation in COVID-19, we further provide evidences on utilization of recombinant probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as vaccine carrier. Their intrinsic immunomodulatory features, natural adjuvanticity, and feasible expression of relevant antigen in the mucosal surface make them more appealing as live cell factory. Among all available platforms, bioengineered probiotics are considered as the most affordable, most practical, and safest vaccination approach to halt this emerging virus."
