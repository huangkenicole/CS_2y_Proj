        "Currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines are all designed for intramuscular (IM) immunization. However, vaccination today failed to prevent the virus infection through the upper respiratory tract, which is partially due to the absence of mucosal immunity activation. Despite the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, the next generation of COVID-19 vaccine is in demand and intranasal (IN) vaccination method has been demonstrated to be potent in inducing both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Presently, although not licensed, various IN vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are under intensive investigation, with 12 candidates reaching clinical trials at different phases. In this review, we give a detailed description about current status of IN COVID-19 vaccines, including virus-vectored vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines and live attenuated vaccines. The ongoing clinical trials for IN vaccines are highlighted. Additionally, the underlying mechanisms of mucosal immunity and potential mucosal adjuvants and nasal delivery devices are also summarized."
