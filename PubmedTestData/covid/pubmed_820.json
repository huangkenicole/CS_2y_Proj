        "SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for one of the most serious, modern worldwide pandemics, with lasting and multifaceted effects. By late 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 180 million people and has killed more than 3 million. The virus gains entrance to human cells through binding to ACE2 via its surface spike protein and causes a complex disease of the respiratory system, termed COVID-19. Vaccination efforts are being made to hinder the viral spread, and therapeutics are currently under development. Toward this goal, scientific attention is shifting toward variants and SNPs that affect factors of the disease such as susceptibility and severity. This genomic grammar, tightly related to the dark part of our genome, can be explored through the use of modern methods such as natural language processing. We present a semantic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-related publications, which yielded a repertoire of SNPs, genes, and disease ontologies. Population data from the 1000 Genomes Project were subsequently integrated into the pipeline. Data mining approaches of this scale have the potential to elucidate the complex interaction between COVID-19 pathogenesis and host genetic variation; the resulting knowledge can facilitate the management of high-risk groups and aid the efforts toward precision medicine."
