        "A variety of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing devices have been extensively used in biochemical detection for their characteristics of label-free, highly sensitive, and faster detecting. Among them, the spectrum-based SPR sensing devices have offered us great advantages in high-throughput sensing due to their large dynamic range and the possibility of detection resolution similar to that offered by angle interrogation. This paper demonstrates a spectrum-based SPR imaging sensing system with fast wavelength scanning capability achieved by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and a low-cost and speckle-free halogen lamp implemented as the SPR excitation source. Especially, we developed a novel four-parameter-based spectral curve readjusting (4-PSCR) method for data processing, which offered us a faster and more accurate spectral data curve fitting process than the traditional polynomial fitting method. With the configuration, we have also conducted an SPR high-throughput detection of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spike protein, proving its application possibility in the screening of COVID-19 with high accuracy. We believe that the higher sensitivity and accuracy of the system have made it readily used in biochemical imaging and detecting applications."
