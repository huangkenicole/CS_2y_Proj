        "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 pandemic has been declared as a priority disease. Some patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of multiple organ failure and death. The published articles on COVID-19 infection were reviewed. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not completely established. Person-to-person transmission via droplets, probable aerosols, or close contact is considered as the main mode of transmission. With increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2, valuable clinical indicators or treatments should be further identified and summarized. CT scanning plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients or those with initially negative RT-PCR results. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended, except the main supportive treatments, and effective measures should be taken into consideration to protect important organs and prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe infection."
