      "AbstractText": [
        "Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the virus kept developing and mutating into different variants over time, which also gained increased transmissibility and spread in populations at a higher pace, culminating in successive waves of COVID-19 cases. The scientific community has developed vaccines and antiviral agents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease. Realizing that growing SARS-CoV-2 variations significantly impact the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines, we summarize the appearance and attributes of SARS-CoV-2 variants for future perspectives in drug design, providing up-to-date insights for developing therapeutic agents targeting the variants. The Omicron variant is among the most mutated form; its strong transmissibility and immune resistance capacity have prompted international worry. Most mutation sites currently being studied are in the BCOV_S1_CTD of the S protein. Despite this, several hurdles remain, such as developing vaccination and pharmacological treatment efficacies for emerging mutants of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In this review, we present an updated viewpoint on the current issues faced by the emergence of various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical studies conducted to assist the development and dissemination of vaccines, small molecule therapeutics, and therapeutic antibodies having broad-spectrum action against SARS-CoV-2 strains."
