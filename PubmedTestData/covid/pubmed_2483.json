        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate worldwide and a variety of variants have emerged. Variants of concern (VOC) designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) have triggered epidemic waves due to their strong infectivity or pathogenicity and potential immune escape, among other reasons. Although large-scale vaccination campaigns undertaken globally have contributed to the improved control of SARS-CoV-2, the efficacies of current vaccines against VOCs have declined to various degrees. In particular, the highly infectious Delta and Omicron variants have caused recent epidemics and prompted concerns about control measures. This review summarizes current VOCs, the protective efficacy of vaccines against VOCs, and the shortcomings in methods for evaluating vaccine efficacy. In addition, strategies for responding to variants are proposed for future epidemic prevention and control as well as for vaccine research and development."
