        "As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolves, it accumulates mutations, which are changes in the genetic code. Because this virus has built-in RNA repair mechanisms, it generates mutations more slowly than some other RNA viruses. Thousands of mutations have emerged since the beginning of the pandemic throughout all virus genomes sequenced to date, resulting in thousands of distinct variants. However, some variants have recently been discovered that appear to increase transmissibility and may affect illness pervasiveness. In this study, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 variants and how countries intervene with them. We also depicted the top 25 countries where the Omicron variant is prevalent, with the UK, US, Denmark, France, and Australia having the top five places as of January 13, 2022. The perception of SARS-CoV-2 variants was investigated in those five countries, and the propagation rate of the Omicron variant was determined to be 51%, 29%, 26%, 15%, and 44%, respectively, indicating that the Omicron variant is the most prevalent among the others. Then, a study of SARS-CoV-2 infection test rate based on tests conducted per one million populations with a number of sequences in those five countries reveals that 25%, 73%, 1.6%, 4.8%, and 1.5%, respectively, it suggests that viral testing should be increased in all five countries since it will help to determine the precise distribution of variants and aid governments in making policy decisions for public safety. We anticipated the production of new variants strains. This study implies that limiting disease transmissions, such as acquiring a coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and booster doses for those aged 18 and older, as well as wearing the mask in public places, is the best strategy to prevent the emergence of new variants."
