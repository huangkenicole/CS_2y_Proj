        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS-CoV-2) has undergone different molecular changes, sprouting genetic variants of the original wildtype. Clinical comparisons between patients infected with alpha versus delta are scarce.",
        "In this retrospective observational study, adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to confirmed SARS-CoV\u20112 alpha or delta infection were included. Patient characteristics, virologic and laboratory parameters, as well as the clinical course were compared in patients infected with alpha vs. delta variants.",
        "A total of 106\u00a0patients infected with alpha and 215\u00a0patients infected with delta were included. Patients infected with the delta variant were admitted to hospital earlier after symptom onset (6\u00a0vs. 7\u00a0days, p\u202f<\u20090.001). Blood levels of C\u2011reactive protein (43.3\u00a0vs. 62.9\u202fmg/l, p\u202f=\u20090.02) and neutrophil count (3.81 vs. 4.53\u202fG/l, p\u202f=\u20090.06) were lower in delta patients. Furthermore, at hospital admission cycle threshold (CT) values were significantly lower in patients infected with the delta variant (22.3\u00a0vs. 24.9, p\u202f<\u20090.001). Patients infected with the delta variant needed supplemental oxygen less often during disease course (50% vs. 64%, p\u202f=\u20090.02). Furthermore, there was a\u00a0statistically non-significant trend towards a\u00a0lower ICU admission rate among delta patients (16% vs. 24%, p\u202f=\u20090.08) CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with the delta variant were admitted to the hospital earlier, had a\u00a0less severe course of disease and a\u00a0higher viral replication on admission. This may provide a\u00a0window of opportunity for antivirals in the hospital setting."
