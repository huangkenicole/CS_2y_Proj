      "AbstractText": [
        "Several neurological symptoms and complications have been described in association with COVID-19, such as anosmia, ageusia, encephalitis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Here, we review the literature describing SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological manifestations and provide a comprehensive discussion of proposed mechanisms underlying the neurological pathophysiology. First, we analyse the neuroinvasiveness potential of the coronavirus family based on previous SARS-CoV-1 studies. Then, we describe the current evidence on COVID-19-induced nervous tissue damage, including processes behind brain vasculopathy and cytokine storm. We also discuss in detail anosmia and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Finally, we provide a summarised timeline of the main findings in the field. Future perspectives are presented, and suggestions of further investigations to clarify how SARS-COV-2 can affect the CNS."
