        "Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a controllable pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 though is a predominantly respiratory illness; it can also affect brain and other organs like kidneys, heart and liver. Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common during viral pandemics but are not effectively addressed. Fever and cough are common symptoms only in infected individuals but headache and sleep disturbances are common even in uninfected general public. In this selective review, the authors report the available evidence of neuropsychiatric morbidity during the current COVID-19 crisis. The authors also discuss the postulated neuronal mechanisms of the corona virus infection sequelae."
