        "Plain language summary Solid cancer patients are at a higher risk than general population in terms of COVID-19 infectivity and COVID-19-associated death and disease. It is also known that COVID-19 infection has a more severe course in immunocompromised patients. Solid cancer patients may be a vulnerable subgroup of patients to reinfection with COVID-19. The rate of reinfection was 3.1% (n\u00a0=\u00a032) in our study population of 1024 solid cancer patients who were\u00a0tested positive on a COVID-19 PCR test. The death rate of the patients with solid cancer was 34.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a011). In addition, we demonstrated that intensive care follow-up is significantly longer during the reinfection period. It was demonstrated that the time between the last dose of chemotherapy for the patients and the reinfection COVID PCR positivity did not affect the death rate. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected\u00a0people's daily lives and treatments in many aspects. Owing\u00a0to the high death rate of reinfection, even if cancer patients have reinfection, our approach is to continue cancer treatment as soon as the patient is cured. Finally, we support the priority vaccination of cancer patients."

        "<b>Introduction:</b> The objective of this\u00a0study was\u00a0to evaluate the clinical and laboratory outcomes of solid cancer patients who were reinfected with COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Patients who were\u00a0tested negative on the COVID-19 PCR test and those with improved clinical\u00a0conditions\u00a0after infection with COVID-19 were enrolled in\u00a0this\u00a0study. Patients who received a positive COVID-19 PCR test 28\u00a0days after the initial positive PCR test were considered as reinfected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1024 patients with the\u00a0diagnosis of solid malignancy and COVID-19 PCR positivity were examined. The reinfection rate was 3.1%. Mortality rate of reinfection was 34.3%. The serum ferritin and creatinine values in reinfection were found to be significantly higher than\u00a0the first infection (respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study has\u00a0demonstrated one of the first preliminary clinical results of COVID-19 reinfection in solid cancer patients."
