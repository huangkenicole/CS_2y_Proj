        "The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was first reported in South Africa and rapidly spread worldwide in early November 2021. This caused panic in various countries, so it is necessary to understand Omicron Variant. This paper summarizes omicron variant-related research achievements. Studies have shown that Omicron Variant contains many mutations that make it more infectious and transmissible. At the same time, immune escape is also caused, resulting in reduced efficacy of existing vaccines, increased risk of reinfection, treatment failure or reduction of monoclonal antibody therapies, and detection failure. However, current data indicate that Omicron Variant causes mild clinical symptoms and few severe cases and deaths. Omicron Variant is valid for a range of nonpharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling timely isolation and treatment of diagnosed cases is also critical to interrupting the spread of omicron variants. COVID-19 vaccine boosters could undoubtedly help control Omicron spread and infection. However, developing a vaccine specific to Omicron Variant is also imminent."
