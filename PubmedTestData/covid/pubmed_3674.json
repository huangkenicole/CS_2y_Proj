        "A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain, the Omicron variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa in late September 2021. This variant has multiple spike protein deletions and mutations, with 15 amino acid substitutions detected in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These RBD substitutions are hypothesized to increase infectivity and reduce antibody affinity, which is supported by recent data showing that the Omicron variant spreads faster than the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2). Thus, this increase in infectivity should lead to Omicron being the dominant variant and developing screening tests that discriminate between Omicron and Delta variants is urgently needed. In this study, we successfully developed a novel screening assay using high-resolution melting analysis, in which two genotypes at G446/L452 and S477/T478 RBD were determined (G446S/L452 and S477N/T478K for Omicron; G446/L452R and S477/T478K for Delta). Using synthetic DNA fragments, we confirmed both melting point and melting peak shape of the RBD Omicron variant was distinguishable from those of wild-type and the Delta variant. Although this study was conducted without clinical samples, these results suggest that our high-resolution melting (HRM)-based genotyping method can readily identify the Omicron and Delta variants. This simple method should contribute to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus prevent potential widespread infection and inflow of the Omicron variant."
