        "In this study, we described an easy-to-perform nano-luciferase (nLuc) sensor for the rapid detection of 3<b>-</b>chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) encoded by SARS-CoV-2. The technology is based on the cleavage reaction of recombinant-nLuc via 3CLpro. The nLuc-based assay is a general, one-step method and is naturally specific in detection. The stability, sensitivity, detection range, and response time are fully characterized. The application of 3CLpro detection in artificial and human saliva as well as antiviral drug screening demonstrates that the method can quantify 3CLpro with high sensitivity in one step. With its unique features, the nLuc-based assay may find broad applications in the auxiliary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, as well as other types of coronavirus infection."
