        "COVID-19 has been associated with increased risk of thromboembolism in critically ill patients.",
        "We sought to examine the association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and subsequent acute vascular thrombosis, including venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thrombosis (AT), in a large nationwide registry of emergency department (ED) patients tested with a nucleic acid test for suspected SARS-CoV-2.",
        "The RECOVER (Registry of Potential COVID-19 in Emergency Care) registry includes 155 EDs across the United States. We performed a retrospective cohort study to produce odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19-positive vs. COVID-19-negative status as a predictor of 30-day VTE or AT, adjusting for age, sex, active cancer, intubation, hospital length of stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) care.",
        "Comparing 14,056 COVID-19-positive patients with 12,995 COVID-19-negative patients, the overall 30-day prevalence of VTE events was 1.4% vs. 1.3%, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.44, \u03c7<sup>2</sup>). Multivariable analysis identified that testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 status was negatively associated with both VTE (OR 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.94) and AT (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.32-0.80), whereas intubation, ICU care, and age 50 years or older were positively associated with both VTE and AT.",
        "In contrast to other reports, results from this large, hetereogenous national sample of ED patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, showed no association between vascular thrombosis and COVID-19 test positivity."
