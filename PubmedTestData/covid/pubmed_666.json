        "In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel variant of coronavirus has emerged from Wuhan in China and has created havoc impulses across the world with a larger number of fatalities. At the same time, studies are on roll to discover potent vaccine against it or repurposing of approved drugs which are widely adopted are under trial to eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 pandemic. Reports have also shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 disease who can transmit the disease to others too. However, the first line defense of the viral attack is body's strong and well-coordinated immune response producing excessive inflammatory innate reaction, thus impaired adaptive host immune defense which lead to death upon the malfunctioning. Considerable works are going on to establish the relation between immune parameters and viral replication that, might alter both the innate and adaptive immune system of COVID-19 patient by up riding a massive cytokines and chemokines secretion. This review mainly gives an account on how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with our immune system and how does our immune system responds to it, along with that drugs which are being used or can be used in fighting COVID-19 disease. The curative therapies as treatment for it have also been addressed in the perspective of adaptive immunity of the patients."
