        "The world has gone through the critical phase of SARS-CoV-2 crisis caused by the new variants of the virus. The globally concerted effort to characterize viral genomic mutations across different clades has revealed several changes in the coding and also non-coding regions which might lead to a violent presentation or re-infection occurrence. Here, we studied a COVID-19 subject who represented the symptoms following the full recovery of the first infection. COVID-19 specific IgM and IgG were evaluated in both steps. The viral samples from oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal were subjected to RT-PCR and full sequencing was done in both incidences. The sequencing data was fully investigated with the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes were detected. The obtained data is in favor of re-infection with 128 days of interval. SARS-CoV-2 presented more severely in the second episode of the disease and the specific antibodies against COVID-19 were not detectable. Both infections were caused by the same clade 20G, however, the mutation rates were higher in the second incidence including 10 nucleotide substitutions which had rarely been reported before. In the present study, the nucleotide mutations in various regions of the viral genome have been presented. The re-infection could have significant effect on clinical implications as well as vaccination."
