        "There is rising concern that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk of recurrence. Increased rates of infection and recurrence in healthcare workers could cause the healthcare system collapse and a further worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we reported the clinically symptomatic recurrent COVID-19 cases in the two healthcare workers who treated and recovered from symptomatic and laboratory confirmed COVID-19. We discuss important questions in the COVID-19 pandemic waiting to be answered, such as the protection period of the acquired immunity, the severity of recurrence and how long after the first infection occurs. We aimed to emphasize that healthcare workers should continue to pay maximum attention to the measures without compromising."
