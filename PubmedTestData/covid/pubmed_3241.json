        "Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute to ongoing community transmission, however, the benefit of routine screening of asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations is unclear.",
        "To identify SARS-CoV-2 infections 553 seronegative individuals were prospectively followed for 52 weeks. From 4/2020-7/2021, participants submitted weekly self-collected nasal swabs for rtPCR and completed symptom and exposure surveys.",
        "Incident SARS2-CoV-2 infections were identified in 9/553 (1.6%) participants. Comparisons of SARS2-CoV-2(+) to SARS2-CoV-2(-) participants revealed significantly more close contacts outside the household (median: 5 versus 3; p = 0.005). The incidence of infection was higher among unvaccinated/partially vaccinated than among fully vaccinated participants (9/7,679 versus 0/6,845 person-weeks; p = 0.004). At notification of positive test result, eight cases were symptomatic and one pre-symptomatic.",
        "These data suggest that weekly SARS2-CoV2 surveillance by rtPCR did not efficiently detect pre-symptomatic infections in unvaccinated participants."
