        "Minimizing endoscopist exposure to bodily fluids is important for reducing the risk of infection transmission. This study investigated the patient-endoscopist vertical distance necessary to minimize an endoscopist's facial exposure to a patient's visible droplets during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and the ability of a new device to prevent droplets from reaching the endoscopist's face.",
        "A model was developed to simulate a patient experiencing a forceful cough during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with a model endoscopist. Fluorescent dye was expelled from the model patient's mouth towards the model endoscopist during simulated coughs; dye adhesion to the model endoscopist's face was evaluated using ultraviolet light. The simulation was repeated with the model patient positioned 70-100\u00a0cm above the floor, with and without a barrier to shield the patient's face. The accuracy of the cough simulation model and the relationship between patient-endoscopist vertical distance and endoscopist's facial exposure were evaluated.",
        "The flow dynamics of the cough simulation model were similar to that of an actual human cough. There was a significant inverse correlation between the patient-endoscopist vertical distance and the model endoscopist's facial exposure, with positive exposures decreasing from 87% at 70\u00a0cm to 0% at 100\u00a0cm (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The barrier device prevented facial exposure to droplets at all distances.",
        "We found that positioning the patient at least 100\u00a0cm below the top of the endoscopist's head or using a barrier device minimized the endoscopist's facial exposure to visible droplets during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy."
