        "The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), highlights the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this Essay, it is argued that such agents already exist and are readily available while highlighting the challenges that remain to translate them into the clinic. Multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity based on polymers or supramolecular agents and nanoparticles are shown to be broadly acting against diverse pathogens in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, uniquely, such agents can be virucidal. Polymers and nanoparticles are stable, do not require cold chain of transportation and storage, and can be obtained on large scale. Specifically, for the treatment of respiratory viruses and pulmonary diseases, these agents can be administered via inhalation/nebulization, as is currently investigated in clinical trials as a treatment against SARS CoV-2/Covid-19. It is believed that with due optimization and clinical validation, multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity can claim their rightful position as broad-spectrum antiviral agents."
