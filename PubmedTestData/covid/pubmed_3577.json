        "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally with 190.8 million infected cases and 4.1 million deaths as of July 18, 2021. In absence of any definite antiviral agent availability and therapeutic armamentarium, vaccines are considered critical. While 20 vaccines are in use, about 295 vaccines are underdevelopment globally using eleven technological platforms. While the vaccines have >80% efficacy, the ultracold (-70\u00b0C and -20\u00b0C) storage and logistics requirements for some raise concerns for implementation, especially in developing countries. The Ebola vaccination in African countries, which required an ultracold chain provided lessons for these COVID-19 vaccines. The existing vaccine cold chain system suffers from temperature excursions at cold chain stores and during transportations in different countries suggests careful assessment and addressing the gaps for effective vaccine introduction. Appropriate attention for cold chain storage, logistics (especially the last mile), and vaccine management and upgradation is needed to achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness for curtailing the pandemic."
