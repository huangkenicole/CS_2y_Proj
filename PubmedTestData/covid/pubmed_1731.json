        "As novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern emerge, the efficacy of existing vaccines against COVID-19 is declining. A possible solution to this problem lies in the development of a live attenuated vaccine potentially able of providing cross-protective activity against a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic variants. Cold-adapted (ca) SARS-CoV-2 variants, Dubrovka-ca-B4 (D-B4) and Dubrovka-ca-D2 (D-D2), were obtained after long-term passaging of the Dubrovka (D) strain in Vero cells at reduced temperatures. Virulence, immunogenicity, and protective activity of SARS-CoV-2 variants were evaluated in experiments on intranasal infection of Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). In animal model infecting with ca variants, the absence of body weight loss, the significantly lower viral titer and viral RNA concentration in animal tissues, the less pronounced inflammatory lesions in animal lungs as compared with the D strain indicated the reduced virulence of the virus variant. Single intranasal immunization with D-B4 and D-D2 variants induced the production of neutralizing antibodies in hamsters and protected them from infection with the D strain and the development of severe pneumonia. It was shown that for ca SARS-CoV-2 variants, the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype was not obligate for virulence reduction. Indeed, the D-B4 variant, which did not possess the ts phenotype but had lost the ability to infect human lung cells Calu-3, exhibited reduced virulence in hamsters. Consequently, the potential phenotypic markers of attenuation of ca SARS-CoV-2 variants are the ca phenotype, the ts phenotype, and the change in species specificity of the virus. This study demonstrates the great potential of SARS-CoV-2 cold adaptation as a strategy to develop a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine."
