        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019 is a censorious global emergency after World War II. Research on the coronavirus uncovered essential information that aided in the development of the vaccine, and specific coronavirus disease 2019\u00a0(COVID-19) vaccines were later developed and were approved for usage in humans. But then, mutations in the coronavirus gave rise to new variants and questioned the vaccine's efficacy against them. On the other hand, the investigation of traditional medicine was also on its path to find\u00a0a novel outcome against COVID-19. On a comparative analysis between India and the\u00a0United States, India had low death rate and high recovery rate than the latter. The dietary regulation of immunity may be the factor that makes the above difference. The immunity gained from the regular diet of Indian culture nourishes Indian people with essential phytochemicals that support immunity and metabolism. Dietary phytochemicals or nutraceuticals possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, out of which our concern will be on immune-boosting phytochemicals from our daily nutritional supplements. In several case studies, dietary substance like lemon, ginger, and spinach was reported in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Thus in this review, we discuss coronavirus and its available variants, vaccines, and the effect of nutraceuticals against the coronavirus. Further, we denote that the immunity of the Indian population may be high because of their diet, which adds natural phytochemicals to boost their immunity and metabolism."
