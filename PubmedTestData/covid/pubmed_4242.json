        "SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 is a serious pandemic of the 21st century, which has caused a devastating loss of lives and a global economic catastrophe. A successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has suffered a delay due to lack of substantial knowledge about its mechanisms of action. Understanding the innate immune system against SARS-CoV-2 and the role of heat shock proteins' (HSP) inhibiting and resolution of inflammatory pathways may provide information to the low SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates in Africa. In addition, bats being a host to different viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 possess a well specialized IFN-innate antiviral inflammatory response, showing no signs of disease or pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. We discuss the molecular pathways in COVID-19 with a focus on innate immunity, inflammation, HSP responses, and suggest appropriate candidates for therapeutic targets and The contribution of the innate immune system to the efficacy of mRNA or vector based Corona immunizations."
