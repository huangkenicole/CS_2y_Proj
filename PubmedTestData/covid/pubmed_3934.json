        "SARS-CoV-2 infection causes injuries of not only the lungs but also the heart and endothelial cells in vasculature of multiple organs, and induces systemic inflammation and immune over-reactions, which makes COVID-19 a disease phenome that simultaneously affects multiple systems. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are intrinsic risk and causative factors for severe COVID-19 comorbidities and death. The wide-spread infection and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the long-COVID may become a new common threat to human health and propose unprecedented impact on the risk factors, pathophysiology, and pharmacology of many diseases including CVD for a long time. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent demand for precision medicine which needs new knowledge network to innovate disease taxonomy for more precise diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of disease. A deeper understanding of CVD in the setting of COVID-19 phenome requires a paradigm shift from the current phenotypic study that focuses on the virus or individual symptoms to phenomics of COVID-19 that addresses the inter-connectedness of clinical phenotypes, i.e., clinical phenome. Here, we summarize the CVD manifestations in the full clinical spectrum of COVID-19, and the phenome-wide association study of CVD interrelated to COVID-19. We discuss the underlying biology for CVD in the COVID-19 phenome and the concept of precision medicine with new phenomic taxonomy that addresses the overall pathophysiological responses of the body to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also briefly discuss the unique taxonomy of disease as Zheng-hou patterns in traditional Chinese medicine, and their potential implications in precision medicine of CVD in the post-COVID-19 era."
