        "SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that increase transmission or disease severity or reduce diagnostic or vaccine efficacy continue to emerge across the world. Current methods available to rapidly detect these can be resource intensive and thus sub-optimal for large-scale deployment needed during a pandemic response. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based assay that detects mutations in spike gene CRISPR PAM motif or seed regions to identify a pan-specific VOC single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) ((D614G) and Alpha- and Delta-specific (S982A and D950N) SNPs. This assay exhibits good diagnostic sensitivity and strain specificity with nasal swabs and is designed for use in laboratory and point-of-care settings. This should enable rapid, high-throughput VOC identification required for surveillance and characterization efforts to inform clinical and public health decisions. Furthermore, the assay can be adapted to target similar SNPs associated with emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, or other rapidly evolving viruses."
