        "The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, with millions of infected patients worldwide, has severely challenged all aspects of public health. In this regard, early and rapid detection of infected cases and providing effective therapeutics against the virus are in urgent demand. Along with conventional clinical protocols, nanomaterial-based diagnostics and therapeutics hold a great potential against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Indeed, nanoparticles with their outstanding characteristics would render additional advantages to the current approaches for rapid and accurate diagnosis and also developing prophylactic vaccines or antiviral therapeutics. In this review, besides presenting an overview of the coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, we discuss the introduced nanomaterial-based detection assays and devices and also antiviral formulations and vaccines for coronaviruses."
