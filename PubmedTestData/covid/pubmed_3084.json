        "Aim The article reviews the current usage of biocides during this lockdown period for sanitizing our living areas due to the pandemic and discusses the pros and cons. Subject COVID-19 spread like wildfire to over 200 countries of the world across all continents. The causative agent, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is being counter attacked by a thorough application of disinfectants and sterilants. However, the virus mutated over 30 times during this global pandemic, creating panic and leading to enhanced pathogenicity and consequently to more stringent sanitation measures for controlling it. However, excessive use of different types of biocides for disinfecting surfaces is highly alarming in several cases. Extensive application of biocides affects the microbial flora, leading to an abrupt decrease in the number and diversity of beneficial microbes that may directly affect the functioning of nutrient cycles. Results The increased concentration of biocides in agricultural land via surface water or pond water indirectly affect the soil and water ecosystem, soil aggregation and fertility. This will also lead to the flourishing of resistant strains due to loss of competition from the other species, which fail to persist after prolonged use of biocides. Conclusion It is necessary to realize the environmental impacts of biocides and sterilants. It is the right time to stop their entry into the agricultural ecosystem by following adequate management strategies and complete neutralization."
