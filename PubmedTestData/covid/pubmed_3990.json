      "AbstractText": [
        "SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are becoming increasingly available and may serve as a diagnostic aid in a multitude of settings relating to past infection status. However, there is limited literature detailing the longitudinal performance of EUA-cleared serologic assays in US populations, particularly in cohorts with a remote history of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., >2\u2009months).",
        "We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (anti-S1-RBD) assays, using 174 residual clinical samples up to 267\u2009days post-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n\u2009=\u2009154) and a subset of samples obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as negative controls (n\u2009=\u200920).",
        "The calculated diagnostic sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 89% and 93%, respectively. Of the 154 samples in the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort, there were 6 discrepant results between the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays, 5 of which were specimens collected \u2265200\u2009days post-PCR positivity and only had detectable levels of anti-S1-RBD antibodies. When only considering specimens collected \u2265100\u2009days post-PCR positivity (n\u2009=\u200941), the sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 85% and 98%, respectively.",
        "The anti-S1-RBD assay demonstrated superior sensitivity at time points more remote to the PCR detection date, with 6 more specimens from the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort detected, 5 of which were collected more than 200\u2009days post-PCR positivity. While analytical differences and reagent lot-to-lot variability are possible, this may indicate that, in some instances, anti-S1-RBD antibodies may persist longer in vivo and may be a better target for detecting remote SARS-CoV-2 infection."
