        "Sera obtained from convalescent individuals, and vaccinated individuals can induce low neutralizing efficacy against variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the majority of COVID-19 vaccines are less efficacious against VOCs when compared to their efficacy against the original virus. Immune escape is one of the significant mechanisms observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the substantial mutational capacity of VOCs such as B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, C.37, and B.1.621. Omicron, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as B.1.1.529, was identified in South Africa. This variant is a potential new VOC by the World Health Organization (WHO), and confirmed cases have been arising across several nations due to its rapid spreading ability. Omicron variant can acquire substantial immune escape following Delta, Beta/Gamma D614G VOCs and subsequently facilitating potential infectivity due to its enhanced ACE2 binding ability. The Omicron variant is a highly mutated variant accompanied by higher transmissibility and immune evasion. This mini review describes the ability of VOCs to acquire immune escape and also describes the comparative neutralization efficacy of several vaccines, including Booster doses against SARS-CoV-2."
