        "The exponential spread of COVID-19 has prompted the need to\u00a0develop a\u00a0simple and sensitive\u00a0diagnostic tool. Aptamer-based detection assays like ELONA are promising since they are inexpensive and sensitive. Aptamers have advantages over antibodies in wide modification, small size, <i>in vitro</i> selection, and stability under stringent conditions, which aid in scalable and reliable detection. In this work, we used aptamers against SARS-CoV-2 RBD S protein to design a simple and sensitive ELONA detection tool. Screening CoV2-RBD-1C and CoV2-RBD-4C aptamers and optimizing assay conditions led to the development of a direct ELONA that can detect SARS-CoV-2 RBD S glycoprotein in buffer solution and 0.1\u00a0% human nasal fluid with a detection limit of 2.16 ng/mL and 1.02 ng/mL, respectively. We detected inactivated Alpha, Wuhan, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 with the detection limit of 3.73, 5.72, and 6.02 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, respectively. Using the two aptamers as capture and reporter elements, we designed a more sensitive sandwich assay to identify the three SARS-CoV-2 variants employed in this research. As predicted, a lower detection limit was obtained. Sandwich assay LOD\u00a0was 2.31 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL for Alpha, 1.15 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL for Wuhan, and 2.96 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL for Delta. The sensitivity of\u00a0sandwich ELONA was validated\u00a0using\u00a0Alpha and Wuhan variants spiked in 0.1% human nasal fluid sample condition and were detected in 1.41 and 1.79 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL LOD, respectively. SEM was used to visualize\u00a0the presence of viral particles in the\u00a0Delta variant sample. The effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 in this study confirms the potential of our aptamer-based technique as a screening tool."
