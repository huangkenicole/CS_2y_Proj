        "The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected more than 19.7\u00a0million persons worldwide with 7\u00a028\u00a0013 deaths till August 10, 2020. It has put an unprecedented workload on healthcare systems with special reference to labor rooms and obstetrics as deliveries cannot be stopped or postponed. Preparing their facilities using triage (COVID-positive patients, COVID-suspect patients, and COVID-negative patients) can help to better utilize the limited resources and help in prevention of spread of disease, and improve maternal and perinatal outcome. There is a need for proper training of healthcare providers for judicious use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for optimum outcome. Fortunately, the available literature suggests that there is no substantial increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 in pregnancy or its increased virulence in pregnancy and labor and there are no adverse effects on fetus and neonate with negligible fetal transmission rate. Nevertheless, utmost care is needed to manage such pregnancies, their prenatal care, and labor. This review aimed to highlight the main recommendations applied in Indian maternities for better management of pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic."
