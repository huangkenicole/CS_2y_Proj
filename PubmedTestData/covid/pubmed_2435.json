      "AbstractText": [
        "The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant was potentially generated from a chronically infected COVID-19 patient vaccinated with an messenger RNA (mRNA)- or non-mRNA-based vaccine, offering the opportunity for the virus to evolve and mutate to evade the body's immune response. To understand the significance of this SARS-CoV-2 variant and what it means for the global response to the pandemic, vaccinologists should systematically evaluate the role of mRNA- and non-mRNA-based vaccines in the generation of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, including variants of concerns (VOCs) and interest (VOIs), that occur via breakthrough vaccine-elicited immunity. Although COVID vaccine boosters are likely to offer some protection and mRNA- or non-mRNA-based vaccines can be adapted to new variants, such as Omicron, the requirement of a booster so soon after full vaccination, with further shots potentially required, is of concern given the impacts on human health. Therefore, in the race to protect the global population against novel SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and VOIs, there is an urgent need to create much more effective one-dose vaccines that can protect people over their entire lifetime."
