        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has the characteristic accessory protein ORF8. Although clinical reports indicate that ORF8 variant strains (\u0394382 and L84S variants) are less likely to cause severe illness, functional differences between wild-type and variant ORF8 are unknown. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the ORF8 protein have not been analyzed. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the wild-type ORF8 and its L84S variant were analyzed and compared. Using the tobacco BY-2\u00a0cell production system, which has been successfully used to produce the wild-type ORF8 protein with a single conformation, was used to successfully produce the ORF8 L84S variant protein at the same level as wild-type ORF8. The produced proteins were purified, and their temperature and pH dependencies were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Our data suggested that the wild-type and L84S variant ORF8 structures are highly stable over a wide temperature range. Both proteins displayed an aggregated conformation at higher temperature that reverted when the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Moreover, ORF8 precipitated at acidic pH and this precipitation was reversed when the solution pH was shifted to neutral. Interestingly, the L84S variant exhibited greater solubility than wild-type ORF8 under acidic conditions. Thus, the finding indicated that conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8 are key properties related to function in oppressive environments."
