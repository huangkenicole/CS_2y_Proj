        "We present a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COV\u0130D-19) re-infection where the time interval between two COV\u0130D-positive episodes is the longest in the literature. A 40-year male patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with\u00a0 complaints of sore throat, cough and diarrhea; and was re-diagnosed as COV\u0130D-19 positive after a virus-free period. He did not have a chronic disease in his anamnesis and used no medication. After COV\u0130D-19 infection and a long recovery period, he became COV\u0130D-19 positive again. In this case, the time to second COV\u0130D-19 infection was 94 days from the first positive PCR test and 86 days from the complete resolution of symptoms. This is one of the longest COVID-19-free period between two episodes of infection in the literature. Key Words: COVID-19, Recurrence, Re-infection, Recovery."
