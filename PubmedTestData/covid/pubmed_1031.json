        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps evolving and mutating into newer variants over time, which gain higher transmissibility, disease severity, and spread in communities at a faster rate, resulting in multiple waves of surge in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. A highly mutated and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has recently emerged, driving the extremely high peak of infections in almost all continents at an unprecedented speed and scale. The Omicron variant evades the protection rendered by vaccine-induced antibodies and natural infection, as well as overpowers the antibody-based immunotherapies, raising the concerns of current effectiveness of available vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based therapies. This review outlines the most recent advancements in studying the virology and biology of the Omicron variant, highlighting its increased resistance to current antibody-based therapeutics and its immune escape against vaccines. However, the Omicron variant is highly sensitive to viral fusion inhibitors targeting the HR1 motif in the spike protein, enzyme inhibitors, involving the endosomal fusion pathway, and ACE2-based entry inhibitors. Omicron variant-associated infectivity and entry mechanisms of Omicron variant are essentially distinct from previous characterized variants. Innate sensing and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 and T cell immunity to the virus provide new perspectives of vaccine and drug development. These findings are important for understanding SARS-CoV-2 viral biology and advances in developing vaccines, antibody-based therapies, and more effective strategies to mitigate the transmission of the Omicron variant or the next SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern."
