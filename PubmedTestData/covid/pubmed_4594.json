        "The aims of this study were: to determine the incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2\u00a0(SARS-CoV-2) infection among vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs), assess risk factors associated with the vaccine breakthrough (BT), and compare the effectiveness of vaccine manufacturers against SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern among HCWs in Duhok governorate. It is a multicenter retrospective cohort study, which enrolled 944 HCWs through March 2022. COVID-19 vaccinated HCWs aging 18 and above were included. A random sampling process was performed by asking the participants to fill out a standardized questionnaire by means of interviews or participant-completed surveys. Fully vaccinated HCWs with positive polymerase chain reaction tests were considered to have vaccine BT infection.\u00a0Two hundred\u00a0and\u00a0eighty-four (30.1%) out of 944 vaccinated HCWs had SARS-CoV-2 infection postvaccination, of whom 241 (84.9%) were fully vaccinated, concluding that the incidence of BT infection is 25.5%. There were 422 (44.7%) males and 522 (55.3%) females. Most vaccine BT infections had developed in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (53.5%). The majority of BT infections were mild to moderate (95.5%). Occupation, namely dentist was a significant risk factor, with a\u00a0p value\u00a0of 0.001. HCWs with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevaccination were more prone to a vaccine BT infection (p value\u00a0=0.002). Pfizer vaccine manufacturers revealed the highest effectiveness against BT infection (p value\u00a0=0.0001). Paramedics showed a significant association with the disease severity (p value\u00a0=0.02). The three available vaccine manufacturers in the Duhok governorate are effective against COVID-19 BT infections. Dentists and paramedics were significantly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes."
