        "Sensitive molecular diagnostic assays are essential for COVID-19 diagnosis. We evaluated the Hecin Scientific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test kit, a dual-target\u00a0real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2\u00a0N and ORF1ab genes.",
        "The Hecin test kit's diagnostic performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA was compared to the LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene kit (TIB Molbiol) and an in-house single-tube nested real-time RT-PCR using 296 clinical specimens, 11 proficiency testing samples, and 30 low-positive deep throat saliva and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples pooled into negative samples in ratios of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:30.",
        "The limit-of-detection of the Hecin test kit was around 500 dC/mL for the N and ORF1ab targets. Sensitivity and specificity of the Hecin test kit were 98.1% (95% CI: 93.4-99.8%) and 100% (98.1-100%), respectively, when measured against the reference method. The Hecin test kit showed fair sensitivity (80%) in low-positive NPS samples pooled in ratios of 1:5 and 1:10. Its performance in pooled samples could be dramatically improved by adjusting the assay Ct cutoff.",
