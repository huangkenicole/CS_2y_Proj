        "SARS-CoV-2 is one of the beta-coronaviruses with the spike protein. It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages. Further, we discussed the importance of hierarchical management and dynamic observation in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics. We then summed up the advance in SARS-CoV-2 testing technology and described the prospect of intelligent medicine in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks."
