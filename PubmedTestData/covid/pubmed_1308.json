        "To identify important background information on pooled tested of employees that employers workers, and health authorities should consider.",
        "This paper is a commentary based on the review by the authors of pertinent literature generally from preprints in medrixiv.org prior to August 2020.",
        "Pooled testing may be particularly useful to employers in communities with low prevalence of COVID-19. It can be used to reduce the number of tests and associated financial costs. For effective and efficient pooled testing employers should consider it as part of a broader, more comprehensive workplace COVID-19 prevention and control program. Pooled testing of asymptomatic employees can prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and help assure employers and customers that employees are not infectious."
