        "We presented a polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhanced ligation-triggered self-priming isothermal amplification (PEG-LSPA) for the detection D614G mutation in S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. PEG was employed to improve the ligation efficiency of this assay by constructing a molecular crowding environment. Two hairpin probes (H1 and H2) were designed to contain 18\u00a0nt and 20\u00a0nt target binding site at their 3' end and 5' end, respectively. In presence of target sequence, it complemented with H1 and H2 to trigger ligation by ligase under molecular crowding condition to form ligated H1-H2 duplex. Then 3' terminus of the H2 would be extended by DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions to form a longer extended hairpin (EHP1). 5' terminus of EHP1 with phosphorothioate (PS) modification could form hairpin structure due to the lower Tm value. The resulting 3' end overhang would also fold back as a new primer to initiate the next round of polymerization, resulting in the formation of a longer extended hairpin (EHP2) containing two target sequence domains. In the circle of LSPA, long extended hairpin (EHPx) containing numerous target sequence domains was produced. The resulting DNA products can be monitored in real-time fluorescence signaling. Our proposed assay owns an excellent linear range from 10\u00a0fM to 10\u00a0nM with a detection limit down to 4\u00a0fM. Thus, this work provides a potential isothermal amplification method for monitoring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants."
