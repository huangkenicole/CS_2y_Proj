        "We aimed to demonstrate the role of real-time, on-site, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the management of hospital outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",
        "This retrospective study was undertaken at our institutions in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, between July 2021 and April 2022. We included SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks due to SARS-CoV-2 \u03b4 (delta) and \u03bf (omicron) variants. All unexpected SARS-CoV-2-positive cases identified within the hospital were managed by the infection control team. An outbreak was defined as 2 or more cases acquired on a single ward. We included only outbreaks with 2 or more suspected transmission events in which WGS was utilized to assist with outbreak assessment and management.",
        "We studied 8 outbreaks involving 266 patients and 486 staff, of whom 73 (27.4%) and 39 (8.0%), respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak management. WGS was used to evaluate the source of the outbreak, to establish transmission chains, to highlight deficiencies in infection control practices, and to delineate between community and healthcare acquired infection.",
        "Real-time, on-site WGS combined with epidemiologic assessment is a useful tool to guide management of hospital SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. WGS allowed us (1) to establish likely transmission events due to personal protective equipment (PPE) breaches; (2) to detect inadequacies in infection control infrastructure including ventilation; and (3) to confirm multiple viral introductions during periods of high community SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Insights gained from WGS-guides outbreak management directly influenced policy including modifying PPE requirements, instituting routine inpatient SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, and confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing prior to placing patients in a cohort setting."
