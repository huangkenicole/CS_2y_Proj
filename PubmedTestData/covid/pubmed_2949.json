        "Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral RNA replication by blocking RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. First developed and tested during the Ebola epidemic, repurposed, and gained prominence during the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on data from three major trials, remdesivir became the first and only medication to obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 disease.",
        "The purpose of the article is to review available preclinical, clinical, and post-marketing data to assess the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. We performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published on remdesivir until January 2021.",
        "The substantial evidence of its effectiveness in a few trials together with the favorable safety profile makes remdesivir a primary therapeutic candidate for treatment in adult and pediatric patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and requiring oxygen supplementation. While remdesivir does not improve mortality, it has been shown to reduce the recovery time and increase the odds for clinical improvement, specifically in patients with early presentation and moderate COVID-19 disease. Remdesivir is well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile in the pediatric and adult populations."
