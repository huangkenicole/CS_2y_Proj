      "AbstractText": [
        "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic saw the rapid rise, global spread, and diversification of the omicron variant in 2022. Given the overwhelming dominance of this variant globally and its diverse lineages, there is an urgent need to ensure that diagnostic assays are capable of detecting widely circulating omicron sub-lineages.",
        "Remnant clinical VTM samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed infections (n\u00a0=\u00a0733) collected in Wisconsin (n\u00a0=\u00a094), New York (n\u00a0=\u00a0267), and South Carolina (n\u00a0=\u00a0372) throughout 2022 were sequenced, classified, and tested with m2000 RealTime SARS-CoV-2, Alinity m SARS-CoV-2, ID NOW COVID-19 v2.0, BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, and Panbio COVID-19 Rapid Test Device assays.",
        "Sequences and lineage classifications were obtained for n\u00a0=\u00a0641/733 (87.4%) samples and included delta (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and representatives from all major SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants circulating in 2022 (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5, BE, BF, BQ.1, and XBB). Panels of diverse omicron lineages were tested by molecular assays RealTime (n\u00a0=\u00a0624), Alinity m (n\u00a0=\u00a080), and ID NOW v2.0 (n\u00a0=\u00a088) with results showing 100% detection for all samples. BinaxNOW and Panbio had sensitivities of 494/533 (92.7%) and 416/469 (88.7%), respectively for specimens with >4 log<sub>10</sub> copies/test, consistent with expected performance for frozen specimens. Furthermore, BinaxNOW demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples 1-4 days, and up to 18 days post-symptom onset in BA.1 infected patients with >4 log<sub>10</sub> copies/test.",
        "This data highlights the rise and diversification of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants over the course of 2022 and demonstrate that each of the 5 tested assays can detect the breadth of omicron variants circulating globally."
