      "AbstractText": [
        "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, remains among the main causes of global mortality. Although antigen/antibody-based immunoassays and neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been successfully developed over the past 2 years, they are often inefficient and unreliable for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Novel approaches against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are therefore urgently needed. Aptamers have been developed for the detection and inhibition of several different viruses such as HIV, influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV. Aptamers targeting SARS-CoV-2 represent a promising tool in the fight against COVID-19, which is of paramount importance for the current and any future pandemics. This review presents recent advances and future trends in the development of aptamer-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and treatment."
