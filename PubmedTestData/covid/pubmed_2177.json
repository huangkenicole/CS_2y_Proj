        "The COVID-19 pandemic poses many direct and indirect consequences for children's health and associated research. Direct consequences include participation of children in COVID-19 research trials, pausing other research in children and the potential implications of a global economic downturn on future research funding. Collaborative and networked research together with streamlined research processes and use of remote technology have been central to efforts by clinicians and scientists around the world and have proved essential for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. IMPACT: Maintain streamlined and efficient approaches to research governance and data sharing to facilitate high-quality collaborative research. Ensure early inclusion of children in trials of therapies for diseases that affect all age groups. Paediatric Research Societies should co-ordinate effective processes to define key research questions and develop multinational clinical trials for diagnostics, therapeutics and preventative strategies for infants, children and young people."
