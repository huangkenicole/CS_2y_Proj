        "The world is currently facing a novel viral pandemic (SARS-CoV-2), and large-scale testing is central to decision-making for the design of effective policies and control strategies to minimize its impact on the global population. However, testing for the presence of the virus is a major bottleneck in tracking the spreading of the disease. Given its adaptability regarding the nucleotide sequence of target regions, RT-qPCR is a strong ally to reveal the rapid geographical spreading of novel viruses. We assessed PCR variations in the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis taking into account public genome sequences and diagnosis kits used by different countries. We analyzed 226 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected by March 22, 2020. Our work utilizes a phylogenetic approach that reveals the early evolution of the virus sequence as it spreads around the globe and informs the design of RT-qPCR primers and probes. The quick expansion of testing capabilities of a country during a pandemic is largely impaired by the availability of adequately trained personnel on RNA isolation and PCR analysis, as well as the availability of hardware (thermocyclers). We propose that rapid capacity development can circumvent these bottlenecks by training medical and non-medical personnel with some laboratory experience, such as biology-related graduate students. Furthermore, the use of thermocyclers available in academic and commercial labs can be promptly calibrated and certified to properly conduct testing during a pandemic. A decentralized, fast-acting training and testing certification pipeline will better prepare us to manage future pandemics."
