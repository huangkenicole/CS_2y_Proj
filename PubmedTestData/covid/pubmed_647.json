        "The calamity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), COVID-19, is still a global human tragedy. To date, no specific antiviral drug or therapy has been able to break the widespread of SARS-CoV2. It has been generally believed that stimulating protective immunity via universal vaccination is the individual strategy to manage this pandemic. Achieving an effective COVID-19 vaccine requires attention to the immunological and non-immunological standpoints mentioned in this article. Here, we try to introduce the considerable immunological aspects, potential antigen targets, appropriate adjuvants as well as key points in the various stages of COVID-19 vaccine development. Also, the principal features of the preclinical and clinical studies of pioneering COVID-19 vaccine candidates were pointed out by reviewing the available information. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in the successful design of the COVID-19 vaccine and address the most fundamental strengths and weaknesses of common vaccine platforms."
