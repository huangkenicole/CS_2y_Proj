        "As of August 2021, there were three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this narrative review is to examine the early experience from the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of BNT162b2 (Pfizer, Inc./BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Inc.), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen Global Services, LLC) through July 2021. The EUA data from the clinical trials have largely been corroborated by real-world effectiveness investigations post-authorization. These studies indicate that immunity is obtained within 2\u00a0weeks post-vaccination and may endure for 6\u00a0months. The immunity conferred by the vaccines may also be effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Additionally, populations not included in the emergency use authorization studies may also benefit from vaccination. This look back at the initial clinical experience can be used by the global community to inform and develop COVID-19 vaccine programs."
