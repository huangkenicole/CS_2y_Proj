        "I recently completed work at a large-scale, drive-through COVID-19 vaccination initiative and was immediately struck by its military parallel in mobilizing this emergent medical response. Federal personnel were deployed quickly to assist the local workforce untested in a public health domain. The expansive integration of technology was at a level I had not previously witnessed. Computerized algorithms organized the flow of cars through a huge fairground (think Disneyland Park). Databases were created to register the public, make appointments, and document the specifics of vaccination administration. From day one, the pharmacy tent was in constant overdrive to ensure vaccine supply was in sync with hourly demand. The interface of all these platforms vaccinated 2,300 people per day."
