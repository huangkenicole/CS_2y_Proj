        "The continuous mutation of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput detection methods. To better analyze the antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in vaccinated or infected subjects, we developed a multiplex detection named Barcode Bead Fluorescence (BBF) assay. These barcode beads were magnetic, characterized by 2-dimensional edges, highly multiplexed, and could be decrypted with visible light. We conjugated 12 magnetic barcode beads with corresponding nine spike proteins (wild-type, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and current omicrons), two nucleocapsid proteins (wild-type and omicron), and one negative control. First, the conjugated beads underwent serial quality controls via fluorescence labeling, e.g., reproducibility (R square\u00a0=\u00a00.99) and detection limits (119\u00a0pg via anti-spike antibody). Next, we investigated serums from vaccinated subjects and COVID-19 patients for clinical applications. A significant reduction of antibody levels against all variant beads was observed in both vaccinated and COVID-19 studies. Subjects with two doses of mRNA-1273 exhibited the highest level of antibodies against all spike variants compared to two doses of AZD1222 and unvaccinated. We also found that COVID-19 patients showed higher antibody levels against spike beads from wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta. Finally, the nucleocapsid beads served as markers to distinguish infections from vaccinated subjects. Overall, this study developed the BBF assay for analyzing humoral immune responses, which has the advantages of robustness, automation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness."
