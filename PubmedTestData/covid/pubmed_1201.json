        "Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the demand for an easily accessible high-throughput screening test is increasing. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the extrac-tion-free polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a screening test to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Real-time reverse transcription PCR was performed in 300 samples (260 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 40 negatives), using both the conventional nucleic acid extraction method (standard method) and the direct method without nucleic acid extraction (direct method). The overall agreement between the standard and direct methods was 86.8 % (kappa 0.60), and the sensitivity of the direct method compared to the standard method was 85.4 %. When the cycle threshold (Ct) value was less than 35, the sensitivity was approximately 90 %-98 %, and when Ct exceeded 35, it decreased to approximately 60 %-65 %. The extraction-free PCR could be useful as a screening test that processes many samples in a short time."
