        "Diagnostic testing accessibility and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 present major challenges for curbing and preventing community prevalence of COVID-19. At-home sample collection for molecular testing provides a convenient and effective solution for disease containment and prevention.",
        "This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, case-control study. Our primary aim was to determine the prevalence and relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals using at-home sample collection kits for diagnosis. Participants included adults from across the United States who completed a COVID-19 Home Collection kit between May 2020 and September 2021. Main measurements included self-reported symptoms and at-home self-collected anterior nasal swab RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2.",
        "Data from 282,831 individuals were included in this analysis. The overall SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of at-home test takers was low compared to national averages during this period (3.28% vs. 7.68%). Those reporting no symptoms were at lower risk of positive test results compared to those with symptoms (risk ratio: 0.080, 95% CI, 0.078-0.082). However, of all positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 48.75% were from individuals reporting no symptoms at the time of testing.",
        "We conclude that at-home sample collection is a viable option and potentially important strategy for improving access to testing, detecting asymptomatic cases, and curbing preventable transmission of COVID-19."
