        "Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is the worldwide challenge. The virus is highly contagious, and clinical consequences were very divers. It is estimated that if no effective action is taken, COVID-19 could plague 90% of the world's population and kill over 40 million people. So, it is essential to understand the virus pathogenicity and follow the preventive methods to control the high morbidity and mortality rates. Meanwhile our current knowledge of COVID-19 is still limited, despite hard efforts of scientists and clinicians during last few months. In this review article, we have collected the latest data about characteristics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2."
