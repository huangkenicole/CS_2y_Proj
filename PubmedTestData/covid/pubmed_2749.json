        "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising tool to efficiently monitor COVID-19 prevalence in a community. For WBE community surveillance, automation of the viral RNA detection process is ideal. In the present study, we achieved near full-automation of a previously established method, COPMAN (COagulation and Proteolysis method using MAgnetic beads for detection of Nucleic acids in wastewater), which was then applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater for half a year. The automation line employed the Maholo LabDroid and an automated-pipetting device to achieve a high-throughput sample-processing capability of 576 samples per week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified with the automated COPMAN using samples collected from two wastewater treatment plants in the Sagami River basin in Japan between 1 November 2021 and 24 May 2022, when the numbers of daily reported COVID-19 cases ranged from 0 to 130.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. The automated COPMAN detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 81 out of 132 samples at concentrations of up to 2.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>\u00a0copies/L. These concentrations showed direct correlations with subsequently reported clinical cases (5-13\u00a0days later), as determined by Pearson's and Spearman's cross-correlation analyses. To compare the results, we also conducted testing with the EPISENS-S (Efficient and Practical virus Identification System with ENhanced Sensitivity for Solids, Ando et al., 2022), a previously reported detection method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected with EPISENS-S correlated with clinical cases only when using Spearman's method. Our automated COPMAN was shown to be an efficient method for timely and large-scale monitoring of viral RNA, making WBE more feasible for community surveillance."
