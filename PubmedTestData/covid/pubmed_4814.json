        "Shipment of COVID-19 specimens within the country or overseas at long distances requires cold chain facility using dry ice and triple packing to prevent the risk of COVID-19 infection to the personnel involved in sample transport. The present study aimed to utilize FTA card technology as an alternate means of sample transport and storage across the country. Twenty-one SARS-CoV-2 lab confirmed samples with different Ct value (High, medium & low) were used to detect viral load in samples loaded on FTA card and further compared with VTM samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by rRT-PCR after storing for 14\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The present study evaluated the utility of FTA cards for preserving the SARS CoV-2 RNA for 14-day period. A significant difference (P\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed in the cycle threshold (\u0394Ct 4-5) values obtained from FTA and VTM viral samples but it did not affect the positivity. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be recovered efficiently from FTA sample stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 14\u00a0days. Thus, FTA cards could be an alternate option for transporting the samples at ambient temperature for a long time."
