        "COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy involves the use of circulating antibodies administration from recovered COVID 19 patients as a practical strategy to provide immediate passive immunity in susceptible recipients in need. Global concern over the potential for \"second\" or \"third\" waves of infection to occur before effective vaccines or drug therapies are available has many looking at other biological sources for large-scale production of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This report summarizes some of the novel strategies for developing alternative safe sources of therapeutic autologous antibodies from COVID -19 infected patients, and provides some original thoughts on how to rapidly implement a safe passive immunity in those COVID-19 patients who are most in need of intervention. COVID-19 antibodies can be isolated or delivered using a number of other techniques including: plasmapheresis, plasma cryoprecipitate reduced (cryosupernatant), antibody hyperconcentrates and advanced cell-based delivery systems. While these proposed technological options may, in some cases, be theoretical, the growing concern over the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has prompted many to pursue innovative and creative solutions to reduce the mortality and morbidity resulting from the current global pandemic. A comparative analysis of various strategies currently in use deserved exploring and this highlighted separately as the essential part of this concise theme."
