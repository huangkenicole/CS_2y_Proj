      "AbstractText": [
        "Since Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported, many commercial Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) have been developed all over the world, and it has been the standard method. Even though several assays were rapidly developed and applied to laboratory diagnostic testing, the performance of these assays was not evaluated in different contexts. Thus, this study aimed to assess the performance of Abbott SARS-CoV-2, Daan Gene, BGI and Sansure Biotech assays by using Composite Reference Standard (CRS). The study was conducted at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) from December 1 to 30/2020. Of the 164 nasopharyngeal samples were extracted by using a QIAamp RNA mini kit and Abbott DNA sample preparation system. Out of 164 samples, 59.1% were positive and 40.9% were negative by CRS. Sansure Biotech positivity was significantly low compared to CRS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The overall agreement of the four assays compared to CRS was 96.3-100%. The performance of the four assays had almost comparable diagnostic performance, except for a low positive rate of Sansure Biotech assay. Hence, Sansure Biotech assay [Research Use Only (RUO)] needs further verification on its use in Ethiopia. Finally an additional study should be considered for evaluating assays with respective manufacturer claims."
