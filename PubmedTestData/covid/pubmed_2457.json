        "This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) decoction with different intervention timepoints in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We retrospectively collected the medical records and evaluated the outcomes of COVID-19 patients that received TCM decoction treatment at different timepoints. A total of 234 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Patients who received TCM decoction therapy within 3 days or 7 days after admission could achieve shorter hospitalization days and disease periods compared to those who received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] 7 days after admission (all [Formula: see text]). Patients who received TCM decoction therapy within 3 days had significantly fewer days to negative SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal/oral swab and days to negative SARS-CoV-2 from urine/stool/blood samples compared to those received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] days after admission (all [Formula: see text]). Patients who received TCM decoction therapy on the 3rd to 7th day after admission had a faster achievement of negative SARS-CoV-2 from urine/stool/blood samples compared to those who received TCM decoction [Formula: see text] days after admission ([Formula: see text]). Logistic models revealed that more days from TCM decoction to admission [Formula: see text] days might be a risk factor for long hospitalization days, disease period, and slower negative-conversion of SARS-CoV-2 (all [Formula: see text]). Conclusively, our results suggest that TCM decoction therapy should be considered at the early stage of COVID-19 patients."
