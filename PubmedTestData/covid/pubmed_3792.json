        "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is a common cause of visits to the hospital emergency department. During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), nonpharmaceutical intervention has influenced the rates of circulating respiratory viruses. In this study, we sought to detect RTI etiological agents other than SARS-CoV-2 in emergency department patients from 13 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa from December 2020 to March 2021. We sought to measure the impact of patient characteristics and national-level behavioral restrictions on the positivity rate for RTI agents. Using the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.0 Plus, 1,334 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with RTI symptoms who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 were tested. The rate of positivity for viral or bacterial targets was 36.3%. Regarding viral targets, human rhinovirus or enterovirus was the most prevalent (56.5%), followed by human coronaviruses (11.0%) and adenoviruses (9.9%). Interestingly, age stratification showed that the positivity rate was significantly higher in the children's group than in the adults' group (68.8% versus 28.2%). In particular, human rhinovirus or enterovirus, the respiratory syncytial virus, and other viruses, such as the human metapneumovirus, were more frequently detected in children than in adults. A logistic regression model was also used to determine an association between the rate of positivity for viral agents with each country's behavioral restrictions or with patients' age and sex. Despite the impact of behavioral restrictions, various RTI pathogens were actively circulating, particularly in children, across the 13 countries. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> As SARS-CoV-2 has dominated the diagnostic strategies for RTIs during the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, our data provide evidence that a variety of RTI pathogens may be circulating in each of the 13 countries included in the study. It is now plausible that the COVID-19 pandemic will one day move forward to endemicity. Our study illustrates the potential utility of detecting respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in patients who are admitted to the emergency department for RTI symptoms. Knowing if a symptomatic patient is solely infected by an RTI pathogen or coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 may drive timely and appropriate clinical decision-making, especially in the emergency department setting."
