      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The development of rapid antigen tests has contributed to easing the burden on healthcare and lifting restrictions by detecting infected individuals to help prevent further transmission of the virus. We developed a state-of-art rapid antigen testing system, named DIAGNOVIR, based on immune-fluorescence analysis, which can process and give the results in a minute. In our study, we assessed the performance of the DIAGNOVIR and compared the results with those of the qRT-PCR test. Our results demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the DIAGNOVIR were 94% and 99.2%, respectively, with a 100% sensitivity and 96.97% specificity, among asymptomatic patients. In addition, DIAGNOVIR can detect SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 with 100% sensitivity up to 5\u00a0days after symptom onset. We observed that the DIAGNOVIR Rapid Antigen Test's limit of detection (LoD) was not significantly affected by the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 variants including Wuhan, alpha (B1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants, and LoD was calculated as 8\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>2</sup>, 6.81\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>1.5</sup>, 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>1.5</sup>, 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>3</sup>, and 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>3.5</sup> TCID50/mL, respectively. Our results indicated that DIAGNOVIR can detect all SARS-CoV-2 variants in just seconds with higher sensitivity and specificity lower testing costs and decreased turnover time."
