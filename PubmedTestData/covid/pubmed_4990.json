        "This review is an integral part of the special issue for the 60 years of the journal <i>Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine</i> (<i>CCLM</i>). The aim of the review is to highlight the role of the clinical laboratory since the emergence of the \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with special focus on the contribution of the journal in generating knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. As of October 30, 2022, a total of 186 <i>CCLM</i> publications were dedicated to COVID-19. Of importance, major International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) guidelines related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 were published in <i>CCLM</i>. Between early-2020 and late October 2022, COVID-19 publications represented around 27% of all articles in <i>CCLM</i>, highlighting the willingness of the editorial board to help the field in order to better describe and diagnose this new emerging disease. First launched in 1963 under the name \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Klinische Chemie\", the <i>Journal</i> was entirely devoted to clinical chemistry in the strict sense. The various topics published in relation to COVID-19 including its diagnosis, its impact on biochemical or hematological measures, as well as biosafety measures, is the perfect example that shows that the journal has greatly diversified over time."
