        "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the ongoing global health emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus is highly contagious, affecting millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, with its trimeric spike glycoprotein, interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and other co-receptors like basigin to invade the host cell. Moreover, certain host proteases like transmembrane serine proteases, furin, neuropilin 1 (NRP1), and endosomal cathepsins are involved in the priming of spike glycoproteins at the S1/S2 interface. This is critical for the entry of viral genome and its replication in the host cytoplasm. Vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs have been developed to overcome the infection. Nonetheless, the frequent emergence of mutant variants of the virus has imposed serious concerns regarding the efficacy of therapeutic agents, including vaccines that were developed for previous strains. Thus, screening and development of pharmaceutical agents with multi-target potency could be a better choice to restrain SARS-CoV-2 infection. Madecassic acid (MDCA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in <i>Centella asiatica</i>. It has multiple medicinal properties like anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic potential. However, its implication as an anti- SARS-CoV-2 agent is still obscure. Hence, in the present in silico study, the binding affinities of MDCA for spike proteins, their receptors, and proteases were investigated. Results indicated that MDCA interacts with ligand-binding pockets of the spike receptor binding domain, ACE2, basigin, and host proteases, viz. transmembrane serine proteinase, furin, NRP1, and endosomal cathepsins, with greater affinities. Moreover, the MDCA-protein interface was strengthened by prominent hydrogen bonds and several hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, MDCA could be a promising multi-target therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
