        "This study evaluates the performance of the PanBio COVID-19 antigen (Ag) test as part of a hospital infection control policy. Hospital staff was encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 when presenting with SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. In a period of approximately 5\u2009months, a steady decline in the performance of the Ag test was noted, epidemiologically coinciding with the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of concern (VOC) in the Netherlands. This led to the hypothesis that the diagnostic performance of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test was influenced by the infecting viral variant. The results show a significantly lower sensitivity of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test in persons infected with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that in persons infected with non-B.1.1.7 variants, also after adjustment for viral load. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Antigen tests for COVID-19 are widely used for rapid identification of COVID-19 cases, for example, for access to schools, festivals, and travel. There are several FDA- and CE-cleared tests on the market. Their performance has been evaluated mainly on the basis of infections by the classical variant of the causing virus, SARS-CoV-2. This paper provides evidence that the performance of one of the most widely used antigen tests detects significantly fewer cases of COVID-19 by the alpha variant than by the classical variants of SARS-CoV-2. This means that the role of antigen tests needs to be reevaluated in regions where other variants of SARS-CoV-2 predominate."
