      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continuing to evolve and accumulate mutations. While various bioinformatics tools have been developed for SARS-CoV-2, a well-curated mutation-tracking database integrated with in silico evaluation for molecular diagnostic assays is currently unavailable. To address this, we introduce CovidShiny, a web tool that integrates mutation profiling, in silico evaluation, and data download capabilities for genomic sequence-based SARS-CoV-2 assays and data download. It offers a feasible framework for surveilling the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluating the coverage of the molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2. With CovidShiny, we examined the dynamic mutation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated the coverage of commonly used assays on a large scale. Based on our in silico analysis, we stress the importance of using multiple target molecular diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 to avoid potential false-negative results caused by viral mutations. Overall, CovidShiny is a valuable tool for SARS-CoV-2 mutation surveillance and in silico assay design and evaluation."
