        "<i>Candida auris</i> continues to be a global threat for infection and transmission in hospitals and long-term care facilities. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has rerouted attention and resources away from this silent pandemic to the frontlines of the ongoing COVID-19 disease. Cases of <i>C. auris</i> continue to rise, and clinical laboratories need a contingency plan to prevent a possible outbreak amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we introduce a two-tier <i>Candida auris</i> surveillance program that includes, first, a rapid qualitative rt-PCR for the identification of high-risk patients and, second, a method to analyze the isolated <i>C. auris</i> for strain typing using the Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy. We have performed this two-tier surveillance for over 700 at-risk patients being admitted into our hospital and have identified 28 positive specimens (4%) over a 1-year period. Strain typing analysis by the IR spectrum acquisition typing method, supplemented by whole genome sequencing, has shown grouping of two significant clusters. The majority of our isolates belong to circulating African lineage associated with <i>C. auris</i> Clade III and an isolated strain grouping differently belonging to South Asian lineage <i>C. auris</i> Clade I. Low numbers of genomic variation point to local and ongoing transmission within the Los Angeles area not specifically within the hospital setting. Collectively, clinical laboratories having the ability to rapidly screen high-risk patients for <i>C. auris</i> and to participate in outbreak investigations by offering strain typing will greatly assist in the control of <i>C. auris</i> transmission within the hospital setting."
