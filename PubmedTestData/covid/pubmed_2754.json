        "Information obtained from autopsies of patients infected with high-risk pathogens is an important pillar in managing a proper response to pandemics, particular in the early phase. This is due to the fact that autopsy allows efficient evaluation of comorbidities for risk assessment, as well as identification of key pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms in organs driving the severity of disease which might be important targets for therapeutic interventions. In the case of patients who have died of infection with unknown pathogens, isolation and culture of pathogens from the affected organs is another important opportunity for a proper response to (re)emerging infectious diseases. However, the situation of COVID-19 demonstrated that there were concerns about performing autopsies because of biosafety risks. In this review we compare requirements for biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories from the European Commission and the World Health Organization and summarize specific recommendations for postmortem analysis of COVID-19-deceased patients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, we describe in detail a BSL-3 facility with enhanced protection of personnel and an environment that has been designed for performing autopsies, biobanking of collected tissue specimens, and culture of pathogens in cases of high-risk pathogen infections and report on the experience obtained in operating this facility in the context of COVID-19."
