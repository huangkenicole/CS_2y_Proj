        "The COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant lockdowns presented a global health challenge and triggered unprecedented research efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein decorating the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions is a prime target for vaccine development, antibody therapy and serology as it binds the host cell receptor and is central for viral cell entry. The electron cryo-microscopy structure of the spike protein revealed a hydrophobic pocket in the receptor-binding domain that is occupied by an essential fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA). The LA-bound spike protein adopts a non-infectious locked conformation which is more stable than the infectious form and shields important immunogenic epitopes. Here, the impact of LA binding on viral infectivity and replication, and the evolutionary conservation of the pocket in other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), are reviewed. The importance of LA metabolic products, the eicosanoids, in regulating the human immune response and inflammation is highlighted. Lipid and fatty-acid binding to a hydrophobic pocket in proteins on the virion surface appears to be a broader strategy employed by viruses, including picornaviruses and Zika virus. Ligand binding stabilizes their protein structure and assembly, and downregulates infectivity. In the case of rhinoviruses, this has been exploited to develop small-molecule antiviral drugs that bind to the hydrophobic pocket. The results suggest a COVID-19 antiviral treatment based on the LA-binding pocket."
