      "AbstractText": [
        "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has wreaked havoc globally, challenging the healthcare, economical, technological and social status quo of developing but also developed countries. For instance, the COVID-19 scare has reduced timely hospital admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Europe and the USA, causing unnecessary deaths and disabilities. While the emergency is still ongoing, enough efforts have been put to study and tackle this condition such that a comprehensive perspective and synthesis on the potential role of breakthrough healthcare technologies is possible. Indeed, current state-of-the-art information technologies can provide a unique opportunity to adapt and adjust to the current healthcare needs associated with COVID-19, either directly or indirectly, and in particular those of cardiovascular patients and practitioners.",
        "We searched several biomedical databases, websites and social media, including PubMed, Medscape, and Twitter, for smartcare approaches suitable for application in the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "We retrieved details on several promising avenues for present and future healthcare technologies, capable of substantially reduce the mortality, morbidity, and resource use burden of COVID-19 as well as that of cardiovascular disease. In particular, we have found data supporting the importance of data sharing, model sharing, preprint archiving, social media, medical case sharing, distance learning and continuous medical education, smartphone apps, telemedicine, robotics, big data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of optimization of individual prevention, diagnosis, tracing, risk-stratification, treatment and rehabilitation.",
        "We are confident that refinement and command of smartcare technologies will prove extremely beneficial in the short-term, but also dramatically reshape cardiovascular practice and healthcare delivery in the long-term future, for COVID-19 as well as other diseases."
