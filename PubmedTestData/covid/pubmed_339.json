        "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses grave threats to both the global economy and health. The predominant diagnostic screens in use for SARS-CoV-2 detection are molecular techniques such as nucleic acid amplification tests. In this Review, we compare current and emerging isothermal diagnostic methods for COVID-19. We outline the molecular and serological techniques currently being used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, past or present, in patients. We also discuss ongoing research on isothermal techniques, CRISPR-mediated detection assays, and point-of-care diagnostics that have potential for use in SARS-CoV-2 detection. Large-scale viral testing during a global pandemic presents unique challenges, chief among them the simultaneous need for testing supplies, durable equipment, and personnel in many regions worldwide, with each of these regions possessing testing needs that vary as the pandemic progresses. The low-cost isothermal technologies described in this Review provide a promising means by which to address these needs and meet the global need for testing of symptomatic individuals as well as provide a possible means for routine testing of asymptomatic individuals, providing a potential means of safely enabling reopenings and early monitoring of outbreaks."
