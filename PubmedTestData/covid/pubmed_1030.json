        "Clinical characteristics of patients in the first community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant B.1.1.7 in Taiwan have not been characterized.",
        "SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from inpatients between May 7 and June 15 in 2021were screen for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage by VirSNiP assay. Clinical characteristics were reviewed and compared with those from Feb 1 to April 30, 2020 and from Jan 1 to March 31, 2022.",
        "One hundred forty-one inpatients from May 7 to June 15, 2021 infected with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage were included. The major presenting symptoms were fever (88.7%) and cough (59.6%). Incidence of relevant complications including pulmonary embolism, simultaneous infections with bacteria, virus, and fungi were 0.7%, 12.8%, 13.5%, and 2.1%, respectively. Old age, high Charlson comorbidity index, short of breath, and initial critical illness were independently associated with 28-day mortality (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In comparison to COVID-19 inpatients from Feb 1 to April 30, 2020, patients from the outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage were older, more severe in disease condition, higher mortality but less obvious initial presenting symptoms. After implementation of nationwide vaccination campaign in the next half year of 2021, COVID-19 inpatients from Jan 1 to March 31 in 2022 indicated less severe diseases than those infected with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage.",
        "COVID-19 inpatients by SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 with old age, multiple comorbidities, and more severe disease conditions were associated with increased mortality. Vaccination for this vulnerable populations may be helpful."
