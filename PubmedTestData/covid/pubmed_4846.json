        "With the decrease in severity of COVID-19 there is a sense of relief in the general population. However, there has been an increased incidence of cardiovascular and other organ complications post-infection, which have raised concerns about long COVID. The term \"long COVID\" was first used by Perego on social media to denote the persistence of symptoms weeks or months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and the term 'long haulers' was first described by Watson and by Yong to identify post-COVID conditions. There has been an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death and MI post-COVID-19 in healthy individuals, sports persons and prominent movie stars. Potential mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of post-acute COVID-19 may include 1) Damage to tissues and cells that are important for blood flow, so clotting of blood is increased. 2) Persistence of fragments of virus or its sub-particles/ protein material in a wide range of body sites and, 3) an immune system gone haywire. As the majority of countries across the globe are easing coronavirus precautionary measures, there is an urgent need by health care organizations and policymakers worldwide to generate awareness by educating the public at large, about the ill effects of long-COVID and varied types of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19."
