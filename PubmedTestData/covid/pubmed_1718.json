        "COVID-19 prevalence has remained high throughout the pandemic with intermittent surges, due largely to the emergence of genetic variants, demonstrating the need for more accessible sequencing technologies for strain typing.",
        "A ligation-based typing assay was developed to detect known variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by identifying the presence of characteristic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). General principles for extending the strategy to new variants and alternate diseases with SNPs of interest are described. Of note, this strategy leverages commercially available reagents for assay preparation, as well as standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation for assay performance.",
        "The assay demonstrated a combined sensitivity and specificity of 96.6% and 99.5%, respectively, for the classification of 88 clinical samples of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants relative to the gold standard of viral genome sequencing. It achieved an average limit of detection of 7.4\u00a0\u00d7\u200910<sup>4</sup> genome copies/mL in contrived nasopharyngeal samples. The ligation-based strategy performed robustly in the presence of additional polymorphisms in the targeted regions of interest as shown by the sequence alignment of clinical samples.",
        "The assay demonstrates the potential for robust variant typing with performance comparable with next-generation sequencing without the need for the time delays and resources required for sequencing. The reduced resource dependency and generalizability could expand access to variant classification information for pandemic surveillance."
