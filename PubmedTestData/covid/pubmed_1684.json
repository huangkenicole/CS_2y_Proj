        "The development of safe diagnostic protocols for working with SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples at Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) requires understanding of the effect of heat-treatment on SARS-CoV-2 viability and downstream RT-PCR sensitivity. In this study heating SARS-CoV-2/England/2/2020 to 56 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C for 15, 30 and 60 min reduced the virus titre by between 2.1 and 4.9 log<sub>10</sub> pfu/mL (as determined by plaque assay). Complete inactivation did not occur and there was significant variability between replicates. Viable virus was detected by plaque assay after heat-treatment at 80 \u00b0C for 15 or 30 min but not 60 or 90 min. After heat-treatment at 80 \u00b0C for 60 min infectious virus was only detected by more sensitive virus culture. No viable virus was detected after heating to 80 \u00b0C for 90 min or 95 \u00b0C for 1 or 5 min. RT-PCR sensitivity was not compromised by heating to 56 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C. However, RT-PCR sensitivity was reduced (\u22653 Ct value increase) after heating the virus to 80 \u00b0C for 30 min or longer, or 95 \u00b0C for 1 or 5 min. In summary we found that the efficacy of heat-inactivation varies greatly depending on temperature and duration. Local validation of heat-inactivation and its effects downstream is therefore essential for molecular testing."
