        "Due to the resurgence of COVID-19, understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is an opportunity to develop adjuvant therapies that could target its pathobiology and lessen the severity of the COVID-19 infection so that our patients could survive. This commentary serves to accomplish this by using published morphoproteomic findings with data mining of the medical literature to define the pathobiology of COVID-19 pneumonitis and provide combinatorial and relatively non-toxic adjuvant therapies that have been successful against this viral infection."
