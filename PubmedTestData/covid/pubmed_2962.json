        "The most common symptoms of coronavirus infections are fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, ache of joints, a loss of smell and loss of taste, and etc. Early studies suggested that smell and taste receptors were associated with pathogenic detection and immunity. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression profile of gene receptors that are related to taste, smell, and appetite control in COVID-19 patients and their putative correlation with SARS-CoV-19 variants.",
        "Gene expression levels of TAS1R2, TAS1R3, TAS2R38, OR51E1, LEPR, GHRL were analyzed in 100 COVID-19 patients and 100 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative group.",
        "The expression levels of TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 genes were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients who were infected with Delta variant. However, the TAS2R38 gene expression level was significantly lower when compared to the control group. The TAS1R2 gene expression was positively correlated with TAS1R3, and TAS2R38 genes (p\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.025, respectively).",
        "TAS1R2, TAS1R3, and TAS2R38 gene expression levels were decreased in the Delta variant compared to the Omicron BA.1 variant in the studied groups. These results provided a significant clue for the temporary taste loss, especially in patients infected with the Delta variant, which is the most disruptive and symptomatic variant causing hospitalizations, and deaths compared to other variants may be because ACE2 is expressed in the taste buds and high replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the infected gustatory cells in the taste bud generates inflammation and then could eventually destroy the cells. This gustatory cell damage may cause malfunction of the gustatory system."
