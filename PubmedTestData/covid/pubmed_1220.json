        "Appearances of SARS-CoV-2 variants have created havoc and additional challenges for the ongoing vaccination drive against pandemic COVID-19. Interestingly, several vaccine platforms are showing great potential to produce successful vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Billions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Mix-and-Match COVID-19 vaccines involving the mixing of the same platform vaccines and also two different vaccine platforms may provide greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. COVID-19 vaccines have become one of the most important tools to mitigate the ongoing pandemic COVID-19.",
        "We describe SARS-Cov-2 variants, their impact on the population, COVID-19 vaccines, diverse vaccine platforms, doses of vaccines, the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, mitigation of the COVID-19 transmission- alternatives to vaccines.",
        "Diverse vaccine platforms may safeguard against ongoing, deadly SARS-CoV-2 and its infectious variants. The efficacies of COVID-19 vaccines are significantly high after the administration of the second dose. Further, it protects individuals including vulnerable patients with co-morbidities from SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The hospitalizations and deaths of the individuals may be prevented by COVID-19 vaccines."
