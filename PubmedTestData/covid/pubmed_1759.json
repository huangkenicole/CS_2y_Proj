        "The role of fomites in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear.",
        "To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through fomites, using evidence from viral culture studies.",
        "Searches were conducted in the World Health Organization COVID-19 Database, PubMed, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021. Studies that investigated fomite transmission and performed viral culture to assess the cytopathic effect (CPE) of positive fomite samples and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of the CPE were included. The risk of bias using a checklist modified from the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria was assessed.",
        "Twenty-three studies were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Five studies demonstrated replication-competent virus from fomite cultures and three used genome sequencing to match fomite samples with human clinical specimens. The mean cycle threshold (C<sub>T</sub>) of samples with positive viral culture was significantly lower compared with cultured samples that returned negative results (standardized mean difference: -1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.00 to -0.90; I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 0%; P < 0.00001). The likelihood of isolating replication-competent virus was significantly greater when C<sub>T</sub> was <30 (relative risk: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.32 to 7.31; I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 71%; P\u00a0= 0.01). Infectious specimens were mostly detected within seven days of symptom onset. One study showed possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from fomites to humans.",
        "The evidence from published studies suggests that replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 is present on fomites. Replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 is significantly more likely when the PCR C<sub>T</sub> for clinical specimens and fomite samples is <30. Further studies should investigate the duration of infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and the frequency of transmission from fomites."
