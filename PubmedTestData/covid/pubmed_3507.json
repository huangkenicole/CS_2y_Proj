        "COVID-19 has halted research around the globe and forced researchers out of their laboratories. Non-emergency medical appointments were canceled. Ongoing clinical trials were challenged to create new modes of operation while public pressure mounted to find therapeutic options against COVID-19. Yet, the inability to conduct research during COVID-19 was overcome with cooperation, resource sharing, and compassion, which provides important lessons on how to improve health related research as we enter a new normal."
