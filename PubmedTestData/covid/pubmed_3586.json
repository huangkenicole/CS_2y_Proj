      "AbstractText": [
        "The worldwide infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impacts human health and life on multiple levels. People infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer from physical disorders and psychological distress. At present, no direct evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 negatively influences human reproduction, and the possibility that gametes and embryos are affected requires further investigation. To evaluate the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human reproduction and fetal health, this review summarizes the basic and clinical research of SARS-CoV-2 on reproduction up to date, hoping to offer guidance and advice to people at reproductive age and provide clues for the prevention and treatment of associated diseases."
