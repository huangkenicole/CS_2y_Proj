        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation since March 2020. To date, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has exceeded 47 million and more than 1.2 million people have lost their lives to the disease. The disease is spreading at an exponential rate with no signs of slowing down. COVID-19 testing and early diagnosis play a crucial role in not just patient management, but also the prevention of the further spread of the disease. Various diagnostic approaches have been applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article will critically review these diagnostic approaches and compare each with the gold-standard, which is viral RNA detection using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
