        "To evaluate the course and effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pregnant women followed up in a Turkish institution.",
        "A prospective, single tertiary pandemic center cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Positive diagnosis was made on a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, and maternal and perinatal outcomes were evaluated.",
        "SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 100 pregnant women. Of them, 29 had the diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR. Eight of the remaining 71 cases had clinical findings highly suspicious for COVID-19. Ten (34.5%) of the confirmed cases had co-morbidities. Cough (58.6%) and myalgia (51.7%) were the leading symptoms. COVID-19 therapy was given to 10 (34.5%) patients. There were no admissions to the intensive care unit. Pregnancy complications were present in 7 (24.1%) patients. Half of the births (5/10) were cesarean deliveries. None of the neonates were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Samples of breastmilk were also negative for the virus. Three neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.",
        "The clinical course of COVID 19 during pregnancy appears to be mild in the present study."
