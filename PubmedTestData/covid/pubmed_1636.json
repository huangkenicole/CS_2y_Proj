      "AbstractText": [
        "Wide variability exists with host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals. Circulatory micro RNAs (miRNAs) are being recognized as promising biomarkers for complex traits, including viral pathogenesis. We hypothesized that circulatory miRNAs at 48 h post hospitalization may predict the length of stay (LOS) and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Plasma miRNA levels were compared between three groups: (i) healthy volunteers (C); (ii) COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir (an antiviral) plus dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid) (with or without baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor) on the day of hospitalization (I); and COVID-19 patients at 48 h post treatment (T). Results showed that circulatory miR-6741-5p expression levels were significantly different between groups C and I (<i>p</i> < 0.0000001); I and T (<i>p</i> < 0.0000001); and C and T (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Our ANOVA model estimated that all patients with less than 12.42 Log2 CPM had a short LOS, or a good prognosis, whereas all patients with over 12.42 Log2 CPM had a long LOS, or a poor prognosis. In sum, we show that circulatory miR-6741-5p may serve as a prognostic biomarker effectively predicting mortality risk and LOS of hospitalized COVID-19 patients."
