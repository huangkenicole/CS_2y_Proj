        "At present, the most powerful new drugs for COVID-19 are antibody proteins. In addition, there are some star small molecule drugs. However, there are few studies on nanomaterials. Here, we study the intact graphene (IG), defective graphene (DG), and graphene oxide (GO) interacting with COVID-19 protein. We find that they show progressive inhibition of COVID-19 protein. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 3CL M<sup>pro</sup> and graphene-related materials (GRMs): IG, DG, and GO. The results show that M<sup>pro</sup> can be absorbed onto the surfaces of investigated materials. DG and GO interacted with M<sup>pro</sup> more intensely, causing the decisive part of M<sup>pro</sup> to become more flexible. Further analysis shows that compared to IG and GO, DG can inactivate M<sup>pro</sup> and inhibit its expression effectively by destroying the active pocket of M<sup>pro</sup>. Our work not only provides detailed and reliable theoretical guidance for the application of GRMs in treating with SARS-CoV-2 but also helps in developing new graphene-based anti-COVID-19 materials."
