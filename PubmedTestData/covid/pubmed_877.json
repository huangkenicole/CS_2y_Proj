        "Presently the world is witnessing the most devastating pandemic in the history of mankind caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS-CoV-2. This dreaded pandemic is responsible for escalated mortality rates across the globe and this is the worst catastrophe in the history of mankind. Since its outbreak, substantial scientific explorations focusing on the formulation of novel therapeutical and/or adjunct intervention against the disease are continuously in the pipeline. However, till date, no effective therapy has been approved and hence the present alarming situation urges the necessity of exploring novel, safe and efficient interventional strategies. Functionally, terpenoids are a class of secondary plant metabolites having multi facet chemical structures and are categorically documented to be the largest reservoir of bioactive constituents, predominant in nature. Intriguingly, very little is scientifically explored or reviewed in regards to the anti-CoV-2 attributes of terpenoids. The present article thus aims to revisit the antiviral efficacy of terpenoids by reviewing the current scientific literature and thereby provide an opinion on the plausibility of exploring them as potential therapeutical intervention to deal with ongoing CoV-2 pandemic."
