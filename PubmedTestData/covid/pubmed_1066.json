        "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) infection provokes serious clinical consequences, which in many situations need hospitalization of the patient in Intensive Care Unit. Additionally, SARS-COV-2 infection can indirectly cause deaths in aged individuals as well as in patients with co-morbidities.",
        "To evaluate the effects of nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic in both hospitalized patients and the general population.",
        "Authors searched Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google, and Institutional websites for medical subheadings terms and free full text referred to \"SARS-CoV-2\", COVID-19\", \"nutrition\", \"immune system\", before 31st July 2020.",
        "A total of 20 articles describing different nutritional interventions for patients with SARS-- CoV-2 infection focusing on the general population have been included. Of these, 6 studies are dealing with nutritional interventions for patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. The others are focalized on a potential beneficial effect exerted by a Mediterranean diet (MD), related to the supplementation of micronutrients and vitamins.",
        "A correct lifestyle, including the consumption of nutrients largely present in MD, may be beneficial for preventing or improving prognosis in the SARS-CoV-2 infection."
