      "AbstractText": [
        "Cats have been shown to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and transmission within the species has been demonstrated experimentally. In cats undergoing natural SARS-CoV-2 infections, human-to-animal transmission was mostly suspected. It can be postulated that, in stray cats with no or only minimal contact with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may pose a minor risk. The current study investigated the prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections in Swiss stray cats using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Saliva swabs from 1405 stray cats were collected in 14 Swiss cantons. The animals were sampled between February 2019 and February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 cohort: 523 cats) and between February 2020 and August 2021 (COVID-19 cohort: 882 cats). All the samples were tested by RT-qPCR, amplifying the envelope (E) gene and, in case of positive or inconclusive results, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2. No SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA could be detected in any of the tested saliva swab samples. Our findings support the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 infections in stray cats are not highly prevalent in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the monitoring of stray cats and other susceptible animal species is necessary, since the \"One Health\" approach has been recognized as being essential to successfully fight the COVID-19 pandemic."
