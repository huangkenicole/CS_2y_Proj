      "AbstractText": [
        "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Delta and Omicron along with waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time contributed to increased rates of breakthrough infection specifically among healthcare workers (HCWs). SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is an important tool for timely detection and characterization of circulating variants as well as monitoring the emergence of new strains. Our study is the first national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance among HCWs in Lebanon.",
        "We collected 250 nasopharyngeal swabs from HCWs across Lebanon between December 2021 and January 2022. Data on the date of positive PCR, vaccination status, specific occupation, and hospitalization status of participants were collected. Extracted viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs was converted to cDNA, library prepped using the coronaHIT method, followed by whole genome sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.",
        "A total of 133 (57.1%) samples belonging to the Omicron (BA.1.1) sub-lineage were identified, as well as 44 (18.9%) samples belonging to the BA.1 sub-lineage, 28 (12%) belonging to the BA.2 sub-lineage, and only 15 (6.6%) samples belonging to the Delta variant sub-lineage B.1.617.2. These results show that Lebanon followed the global trend in terms of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with Delta rapidly replaced by the Omicron variant.",
        "This study underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance programs in Lebanon for the timely detection and characterization of circulating variants. The latter is critical to guide public health policy making and to timely implement public health interventions."
