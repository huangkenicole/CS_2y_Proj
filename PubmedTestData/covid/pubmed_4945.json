        "The newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect humans, and no effective treatment has yet been found. Antibody therapy is one way to control infection caused by COVID-19. However, the use of classical antibodies raises complex issues. Heavy chain antibodies (HCAbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from the Camelidae family. The variable part of these antibodies (Nanobodies or VHH) has interesting properties such as small size, cost-effective production, and good tissue permeability, causing VHH to be regarded as an antiviral therapeutics. However, the small size of nanobodies may lead to low antigen binding affinity and rapid renal clearance. In this systematic review, the application of nanobodies in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and other similar infections (MERS and SARS) was reviewed."
