        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a molecule that mediates the cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several membrane molecules of the host cell must cooperate in this process. While ACE2 serves in a membrane receptor-mediating interaction with the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the virus envelope, enzyme A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) regulates ACE2 availability on the membrane and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitates virus-cell membrane fusion. Interestingly, ACE2, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 show a daily rhythm of expression in at least some mammalian tissue. The circadian system can also modulate COVID-19 progression via circadian control of the immune system (direct, as well as melatonin-mediated) and blood coagulation. Virus/ACE2 interaction causes ACE2 internalization into the cell, which is associated with suppressed activity of ACE2. As a major role of ACE2 is to form vasodilatory angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin II (Ang II), suppressed ACE2 levels in the lung can contribute to secondary COVID-19 complications caused by up-regulated, pro-inflammatory vasoconstrictor Ang II. This is supported by the positive association of hypertension and negative COVID-19 prognosis although this relationship is dependent on numerous comorbidities. Hypertension treatment with inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system does not negatively influence prognosis of COVID-19 patients. It seems that tissue susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 shows negative correlation to ACE2 expression. However, in lungs of infected patient, a high ACE2 expression is associated with better outcome, compared to low ACE2 expression. Manipulation of soluble ACE2 levels is a promising COVID-19 therapeutic strategy."
