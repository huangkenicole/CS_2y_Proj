      "AbstractText": [
        "Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcription PCR is the primary method to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the analytic sensitivity required is not well defined and it is unclear how available assays compare.",
        "For the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (m2000; Abbott Molecular), we determined that it could detect viral concentrations as low as 26 copies/mL, we defined the relationship between cycle number and viral concentrations, and we tested naso- and oropharyngeal swab specimens from 8538 consecutive individuals. Using the m2000 as a reference assay method, we described the distribution of viral concentrations in these patients. We then used selected clinical specimens to determine the positive percent agreement of 2 other assays with more rapid turnaround times [Cepheid Xpert Xpress (GeneXpert; Cepheid); n\u2009=\u200927] and a laboratory developed test on the Luminex ARIES system [ARIES LDT (Luminex); n\u2009=\u200950] as a function of virus concentrations, from which we projected their false-negative rates in our patient population.",
        "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27% (95% CI: 26%-28%) of all specimens. Estimated viral concentrations were widely distributed, and 17% (95% CI: 16%-19%) of positive individuals had viral concentrations <845 copies/mL. Positive percent agreement was strongly related to viral concentration, and reliable detection (i.e., \u226595%) was observed at concentrations >100 copies/mL for the GeneXpert but not the ARIES LDT, corresponding to projected false-negative rates of 4% (95% CI: 0%-21%) and 27% (95% CI: 11%-46%), respectively.",
        "Substantial proportions of clinical specimens have low to moderate viral concentrations and may be missed by methods with less analytic sensitivity."
