        "This retrospective study evaluated stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from Japanese patients with influenza-like illness during the 2019/2020 season. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 had spread in the community before the first confirmed case. The period of influenza season during 2019/2020 in Nagasaki was shorter than in previous influenza seasons. When the first COVID-19 case was reported in Nagasaki prefecture, the number of influenza cases were very low. No positive results for SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 182 samples that were obtained from adult outpatients. Our results revealed no large-scale spread of COVID-19 in the community before the first confirmed case."
