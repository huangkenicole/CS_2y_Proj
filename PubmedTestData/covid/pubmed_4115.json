        "Until now, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remained to be an enormous threat for global health. As one viral illness induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), versatile, rapid and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in early stage is urgently needed. Here, we reported an ultrasensitive and visual in-one-tube detection method which could be accomplished within half an hour from sampling-to-result. By integrating all reactions in one tube, liquid handling steps were omitted and amplicon contamination could be totally avoided. Magnetic beads were employed to achieve the fast extraction of viral nucleic acid and increase the sensitivity. Using portable thermocycler and blue light, the fluorescent results could be directly observed by naked eyes. The proposed method is of higher specificity and sensitivity, nearly at single molecule level. More important, results demonstrated 100% positive detection rate for 40 clinical samples, which was consistent with standard RT-PCR. Thus, our method is considerably simple, rapid, sensitive and accurate, holding great promise for the instant detecting of viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and the next generation of molecular diagnosis."
