      "AbstractText": [
        "The Pandora's box myth addresses the evilness in the world that undisputedly nowadays is identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), formerly known as Covid-19, which belongs to coronaviridae family, identified in Wuhan, Hubei district of the Republic of China in December 2019. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has affected \u223c180 million people and made almost 4 million victims, with a mortality rate of 6.1%, which is 6 times higher than influenza virus. However, coronaviruses are well known in the ophthalmology field because they were used in the so-called experimental coronavirus retinopathy model. That model certainly brings intriguing concepts for understanding coronavirus pathophysiology, which may have important implications on treatment strategies. Certainly, the recent availability of vaccines gives hope on the control of virus spreading; however, vaccines might create immune reactions involving the eye structure. In this study, we reviewed the literature and elaborated the available data to speculate on possible new interpretation of both pathophysiology and treatment of SARS-CoV-2."
