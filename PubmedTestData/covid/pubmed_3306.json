        "On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin detected in Wuhan City by Chinese authorities. Since SARS-CoV-2 discovery, the corresponding disease (COVID-19) has rapidly expanded throughout the globe, making as a consequence the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic. As of May 19, 2020, over 4.806.299 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide, with more than 318.599 deaths."
