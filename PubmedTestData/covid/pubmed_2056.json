        "Constantly mutating SARS-CoV-2 is a global concern resulting in COVID-19 infectious waves from time to time in different regions, challenging present-day diagnostics and therapeutics. Early-stage point-of-care diagnostic (POC) biosensors are a crucial vector for the timely management of morbidity and mortalities caused due to COVID-19. The state-of-the-art SARS-CoV-2 biosensors depend upon developing a single platform for its diverse variants/biomarkers, enabling precise detection and monitoring. Nanophotonic-enabled biosensors have emerged as 'one platform' to diagnose COVID-19, addressing the concern of constant viral mutation. This review assesses the evolution of current and future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 and critically summarizes the current state of biosensor approaches for detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants/biomarkers employing nanophotonic-enabled diagnostics. It discusses the integration of modern-age technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G communication with nanophotonic biosensors for intelligent COVID-19 monitoring and management. It also highlights the challenges and potential opportunities for developing intelligent biosensors for diagnosing future SARS-CoV-2 variants. This review will guide future research and development on nano-enabled intelligent photonic-biosensor strategies for early-stage diagnosing of highly infectious diseases to prevent repeated outbreaks and save associated human mortalities."
