      "AbstractText": [
        "Adenovirus-based vectors are playing an important role as efficacious genetic vaccines to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they have an enormous potential as oncolytic vectors for virotherapy and as vectors for classic gene therapy. However, numerous vector-host interactions on a cellular and noncellular level, including specific components of the immune system, must be modulated in order to generate safe and efficacious vectors for virotherapy or classic gene therapy. Importantly, the current widespread use of Ad vectors as vaccines against COVID-19 will induce antivector immunity in many humans. This requires the development of strategies and techniques to enable Ad-based vectors to evade pre-existing immunity. In this review article, we discuss the current status of genetic and chemical capsid modifications as means to modulate the vector-host interactions of Ad-based vectors."
