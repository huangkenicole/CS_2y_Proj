        "The outbreak of the new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) continues to increase globally. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most used technique in virus detection. However, possible false-negative and false-positive results produce misleading consequences, making it necessary to improve existing methods. Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid`s Xpert\u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%). Unlike single gene targeting strategies, the current method provides the amplification of two viral regions in the same PCR reaction. Therefore, an accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay was provided, which allows testing of 91 samples in 96-well plates in per run. Thanks to this strategy, fast, reliable, and easy-to-use rRT-PCR method is obtained to diagnose SARS-CoV-2."
