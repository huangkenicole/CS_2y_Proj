        "In December 2019 novel coronavirus-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus2 (SARS-CoV2)-originated from Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly around the world. This literature review highlights the dynamic nature of COVID-19 transmission and presentation. Analyzing 59 relevant articles up to May 1st, 2020 reflects that the main reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 pandemic is fever and respiratory involvement. Also, current literature demonstrates a wide spectrum of different and atypical presentation(s) of COVID-19. The definite route of SARS-CoV2 transmission is respiratory droplets, however, virus nucleic acid has been detected in the stool and urine specimens as well. The severity of symptoms and outcomes of COVID-19 vary based on the patient's medical background, age, sex, and concurrent medical conditions (e.g. pregnancy). This is the first review that classifies all essential points regarding COVID-19 manifestations at a glance to improve the outcome of the patients by a better insight into diagnosis and management."
