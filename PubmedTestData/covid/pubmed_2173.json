      "AbstractText": [
        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, with particular risk for severe disease and mortality in the elderly population. SARS-CoV-2 infection is driven by a pathological hyperinflammatory response which results in a dysregulated immune response. Current advancements in aging research indicates that aging pathways have fundamental roles in dictating healthspan in addition to lifespan. Our review discusses the aging immune system and highlights that senescence and aging together, play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In our review, we primarily focus on the immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the interconnection between severe COVID-19, immunosenescence, aging, vaccination, and the emerging problem of Long-COVID. We hope to highlight the importance of identifying specific senescent endotypes (or \"sendotypes\"), which can used as determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Indeed, identified sendotypes could be therapeutically exploited for therapeutic intervention. We highlight that senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells, can target aging-associated pathways and therefore are proving attractive as potential therapeutic options to alleviate symptoms, prevent severe infection, and reduce mortality burden in COVID-19 and thus ultimately enhance healthspan."
