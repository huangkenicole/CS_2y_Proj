        "The optimal diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be selected based on a patient's clinical syndrome and presentation in relation to symptom onset. Molecular testing, most often reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, offers the highest sensitivity and specificity during acute infection, whereas antigen testing can also be useful for acute diagnosis when rapid turnaround of results is necessary or if molecular testing is unavailable. Serologic testing is often reserved for identifying individuals with prior or late COVID-19 infection."
