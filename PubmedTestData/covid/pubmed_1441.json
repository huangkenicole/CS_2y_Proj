        "We retrieved data from the online database of the Italian Ministry of Health concerning the previous and ongoing waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Italy. We analyzed the prevalence of variants, the number of SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared 2 similar days: January 12, in 2021and 2022. Although the number of positive cases in 2022 was nearly fourfold higher compared with the same period in 2021, presumably owing to higher transmissibility of Omicron variant, a considerable decrease of COVID-19 related hospitalizations (-82%) and ICU admissions (-84%) could be observed in the more recent period, when the Omicron variant was largely prevalent and COVID-19 vaccination was widespread."
