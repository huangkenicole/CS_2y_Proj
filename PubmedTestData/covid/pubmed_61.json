        "COVID-19 is a new contagious disease caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a disease that has reached every continent in the world; it has overloaded the medical system worldwide and it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Currently there is no definite treatment for COVID-19. We realize that host immunity is a critical factor in the outcome of coronavirus 2 infection. Here, however, we review the pathophysiology of the disease with a focus on searching for what we can do to combat this new disease. From this, we find that coronavirus is sensitive to heat. We have thus focused on this area of vulnerability of the virus. The emphasis of this hypothesis is on the action of body heat-internal (fever) and external (heat treatment)-in activating the immune system and its antiviral activities, and specifically related to the coronavirus. We hypothesize from this review that heat treatments has the potential to prevent COVID-19 and to decrease the severity of mild and moderate cases of Coronavirus. We propose heat treatments for this uncontrolled worldwide coronavirus pandemic while studies are being done to test the effectiveness of heat treatments in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
