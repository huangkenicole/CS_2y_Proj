        "The aim of this study was to investigate the host factors of patients with COVID-19 that were associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in specimens obtained from the upper respiratory tract.",
        "A median of a 32-day period of viral RNA shedding was observed, ranging from 4 days to 111 days. On multivariate analysis, elderly age was independently associated with prolonged viral shedding (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, P = 0.003). An incremental increase in the duration of viral RNA shedding was observed with increasing age (P < 0.05). The median (quartile) duration of viral RNA shedding was 23 (22) days (\u2264 40 years), 30 (18) days (41-50 years), 33 (21) days (51-60 years), 34 (17) days (61-70 years) and 34 (17) days (> 70 years).",
        "Viral RNA shedding can persist for as long as 111 days in the upper respiratory tract. Increasing age is associated with viral RNA persistence.",
        "The demographic and virological data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant risk factors associated with delayed viral RNA clearance. The duration of viral shedding was compared among age-stratified groups."
