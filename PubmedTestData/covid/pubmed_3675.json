        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be associated with a wide variety of neurological manifestations. Some of these manifestations might result from the ongoing systemic inflammatory state, but the pathophysiology of specific neurologic involvement is still unclear. In this article, we report a patient who developed an isolated cerebellar syndrome 9\u00a0weeks after an episode of COVID-19. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A post-infectious-autoimmune-cerebellitis following COVID-19 was suspected, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids, leading to a complete recovery within a few weeks. We review the other cases of COVID-19-associated cerebellar syndrome reported so far and discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this neurologic manifestation."
