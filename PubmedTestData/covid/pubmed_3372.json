        "Hyperinflammation is related to the development of COVID-19. Resveratrol is considered an anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. Herein, we used a network pharmacological approach and bioinformatic gene analysis to explore the pharmacological mechanism of Resveratrol in COVID-19 therapy. Potential targets of Resveratrol were obtained from public databases. SARS-CoV-2 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out via bioinformatic analysis Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE147507, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis; then, protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The common targets, GO terms, and KEGG pathways of Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs were confirmed. KEGG Mapper queried the location of common targets in the key pathways. A notable overlap of the GO terms and KEGG pathways between Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs was revealed. The shared targets between Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 mainly involved the IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Our study uncovered that Resveratrol is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and we also revealed the probable key targets and pathways involved. Ultimately, we bring forward new insights and encourage more studies on Resveratol to benefit COVID-19 patients."
