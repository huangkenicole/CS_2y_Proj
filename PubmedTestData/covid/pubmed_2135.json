        "Correct and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 suspected patients is essential for diagnosis. Respiratory samples should always be tested with real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, blood samples have been tested, but without consistent results and therefore the added value of this sample type is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR in blood samples obtained from PCR-proven COVID-19 patients and in addition to elaborate on the potential use of blood for diagnostics. In this single center study, blood samples drawn from patients at the emergency department with proven COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Samples from 118 patients were selected, of which 102 could be included in the study (median age was 65 (IQR 10), 65.7 % men). In six (5.9 %) of the tested samples, SARS-CoV-2 was identified by real-time PCR. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by real-time PCR in plasma samples from patients with proven COVID-19, but only in a minority of the patients. Plasma should therefore not be used as primary sample in an acute phase setting to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are important to complete the knowledge on possible sample types to test to diagnose COVID-19."
