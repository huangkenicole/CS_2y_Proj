        "Restoring everyday civil life from the devastating pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be only by the development of an efficient vaccine. As of April 12, 2022, 497,960,492 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, including 6,181,850 lives having been lost worldwide and completely paralyzing the d global economy. Detection of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, in December 2019, and the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that was published on January 11, 2020, leads to a global race, to prepare for a preventive vaccine. No single institution can develop a vaccine individually because there are many stages for developing and producing a successful vaccine. Since this virus threatens the health, the economy, and society the demand for a fast-track vaccine is understandable. This article tries to give an overview of vaccine 'candidates' development and clinical trials, and it mentions some challenges of using these vaccines for managing SARS-CoV-2."
