        "We designed and developed two new types of hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) buses (motorcoach and minibus) with a mobile laboratory system. Feasibility studies have been performed for mobile laboratory testing, particularly for the laboratory performance of COVID-19 RT-PCR (PCR). We evaluated the driving range capability, PCR sample size capacity, turnaround time (TAT), and analytical performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva samples were used for the current study, and the analytical performance was compared with that of the reference PCR. The estimated driving range and sample size capacity of the HFC and HFC minibus were 432\u00a0km and 2847 samples, respectively, for the HFC motorcoach and 313\u00a0km and 1949 samples for the HFC minibus. For the TAT, the median time between sample submission and completion of PCR was 86\u00a0min for the motorcoach and 76\u00a0min for the minibus, and the median time between sample submission and electronic reporting of the result to each visitor was 182\u00a0min for the motorcoach and 194\u00a0min for the minibus. A secondary analysis of 1574 HFC mobile laboratory testing samples was conducted, and all negative samples were found to be negative by reference PCR. Furthermore, all samples were confirmed to be positive by reference PCR or other molecular examinations."
