        "The emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 induced by a newly identified b-coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has constituted a public health emergency. Even though it was considered a zoonotic disease, the virus has also spread among humans <i>via</i> respiratory secretions. The expression and distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) in various human organs might also show other possible infection routes. High ACE2 ribonucleic acid expression has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) indicating its importance as a possible infection pathway of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 induces viral entry into the host and most importantly has been found to be associated with the function of the gut. Its deficiency has been implicated in several pathologies such as colorectal inflammation. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an essential regulatory cascade operating both at a local tissue level and at the systemic or circulatory level. The RAS may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease and is associated with the up-regulation of ACE2. Thus, the aim of this review is firstly, the analysis of some important general and genome characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and secondly, and most importantly, to focus on the utility of ACE2 receptors in both SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, especially in the GI tract."
