        "Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonosis that revised the global economic and societal progress since early 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as the responsible pathogen for COVID-19 with high infection and mortality rate potential. It has spread in 192 countries and infected about 1.5% of the world population, and still, a proper therapeutic approach is not unveiled. COVID-19 indication starts with fever to shortness of breathing, leading to ICU admission with the ventilation support in severe conditions. Besides the symptomatic mainstay clinical therapeutic approach, only Remdesivir has been approved by the FDA. Several pharmaceutical companies claimed different vaccines with exceptionally high efficacy (90-95%) against COVID-19; how long these vaccines can protect and long-term safety with the new variants are unpredictable. After the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous clinical trials with different phases are being performed to find the most appropriate solution to this condition. Some of these trials with old FDA-approved drugs showed promising results. In this review, we have precisely compiled the efforts to curb the disease and discussed the clinical findings of Ivermectin, Doxycycline, Vitamin-D, Vitamin-C, Zinc, and cannabidiol and their combinations. Additionally, the correlation of these molecules on the prophylactic and diseased ministration against COVID-19 has been explored."
