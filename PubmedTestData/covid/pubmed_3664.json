        "To study the clinical and laboratory profile and to assess period for viral clearance in COVID 19 children.",
        "We reviewed hospital records of children (<18 years) admitted from 1 April to 31 May, 2020 at a tertiary-care public hospital and identified those positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) by RT-PCR of respiratory secretions.",
        "81.2% of the 85 children studied were asymptomatic and 3 (8.5%) died. Severe lymphopenia (43.8%), raised C-reactive protein (93.8%), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (75%) and high (>500ng/mL) levels of D-dimer (37.5%) were common. Median (IQR) duration of viral shedding was 7 (5-10) days, with range of 2 to 45 days; 96.3% had viral clearance within 14 days.",
        "Majority of children aged <18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection had viral clearance within 14 days."
