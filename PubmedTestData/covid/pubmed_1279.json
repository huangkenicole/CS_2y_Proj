        "Increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the complex interaction between host and viral factors have allowed clinicians to stratify the severity of COVID-19 infection. Epidemiological data has also helped to model viral carriage and infectivity. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the mechanisms of action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the correlation with the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the disease.",
        "ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors have emerged as a key player in the mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2. Their distribution throughout the body has been shown to impact the organ-specific manifestations of COVID-19. The immune-evasive and subsequently immunoregulative properties of SARS-CoV-2 are also shown to be implicated in disease proliferation and progression. Information gleaned from the virological properties of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with and reflects the clinical behavior of the COVID-19 infection. Further study of specific clinical phenotypes and severity classes of COVID-19 may assist in the development of targeted therapeutics to halt progression of disease from mild to moderate-severe. As the understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 continues to grow, it is our hope that better and more effective treatment options continue to emerge."
