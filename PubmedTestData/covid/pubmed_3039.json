        "The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of widespread testing to control the spread of infectious diseases. The rapid development, scale-up, and deployment of viral and antibody detection methods since the beginning of the pandemic have greatly increased testing capacity. Desirable attributes of detection methods are low product costs, self-administered protocols, and the ability to be mailed in sealed envelopes for the safe analysis and subsequent logging to public health databases. Herein, such a platform is demonstrated with a screen-printed, inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator as a transducer and a toehold switch coupled with cell-free expression as the biological selective recognition element. In the presence of the N-gene from SARS-CoV-2, the toehold switch relaxes, protease enzyme is expressed, and it degrades a gelatin switch that ultimately shifts the resonant frequency of the planar resonant sensor. The gelatin switch resonator (GSR) can be analyzed through a sealed envelope allowing for assessment without the need for careful sample handling with personal protective equipment or the need for workup with other reagents. The toehold switch used in this sensor demonstrated selectivity to SARS-CoV-2 virus over three seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-1, with a limit of detection of 100 copies/\u03bcL. The functionality of the platform and assessment in a sealed envelope with an automated scanner is shown with overnight shipment, and further improvements are discussed to increase signal stability and further simplify user protocols toward a mail-in platform."
