        "Since the first reported case in December of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has became an international public health emergency. So far, there are more than 228,206,384 confirmed cases including 4,687,066 deaths. Kidney with high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is one of the extrapulmonary target organs affected in patients with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the independent risk factors for the death of COVID-19 patients. The imbalance between ACE2-Ang(1-7)-MasR and ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis in the kidney may contribute to COVID-19-associated AKI. Although series of research have shown the inconsistent effects of multiple common RAS inhibitors on ACE2 expression and enzyme activity, most of the retrospective cohort studies indicated the safety and protective effects of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients. This review article highlights the current knowledge on the possible involvement of intrarenal RAS in COVID-19-associated AKI with a primary focus on the opposing effects of ACE2-Ang(1-7)-MasR and ACE-Ang II-AT1R signaling in the kidney. Human recombinant soluble ACE2 or ACE2 variants with preserved ACE2-enzymatic activity may be the best options to improve COVID-19-associated AKI."
