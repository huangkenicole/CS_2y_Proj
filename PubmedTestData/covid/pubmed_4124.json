        "Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh-originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13\u00a0weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA X, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in nonspecific proteins (NSP2-3, NSP-12(RdRp), NSP-13(Helicase)), S-Spike, ORF3a, and N-Nucleocapsid protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations (UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, Envelope protein (E) and accessory factors (NSP7a, ORF 6, ORF7b) suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed a significant association (p\u2009=\u20090.003) with sex and age of the COVID-19-positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex-dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19."
