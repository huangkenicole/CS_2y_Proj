        "Although SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia has been reported to strongly impact patients with severe COVID-19, the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 harboring detectable intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA remain unknown.",
        "We included adult patients who had developed COVID-19 between February and September 2020. Total white blood cells derived from the buffy coat of peripheral whole blood were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Illumina COVIDSeq test. We compared the clinical characteristics between patients with and without detected viral RNA (detected and undetected groups).",
        "Among the 390 patients included, 17 harbored SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral white blood cells. All 17 patients required oxygen support during the disease course and had higher intensive care unit admission (52.9% vs 28.9%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.035), mortality (17.7% vs 3.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), kidney dysfunction (severe, 23.5% vs 6.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.029), and corticosteroid treatment rates (76.5% vs 46.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) than those of patients in the undetected group.",
        "We propose that patients with circulating intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the peripheral blood exhibited the most severe disease course."
