        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has claimed more than a million lives. Various in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies are being conducted to understand the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular metabolism of humans and the various drugs and drug-targets that may be used. In this review, we discuss protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between viral and human proteins as well as viral targets like proteases. We try to understand the molecular mechanism of various repurposed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, their combination therapies, drug dosage regimens, and their adverse effects along with possible alternatives like non-toxic antiviral phytochemicals. Ultimately, randomized controlled trials are needed to identify which of these compounds has the required balance of efficacy and safety. We also focus on the recent advancements in diagnostic methods and vaccine candidates developed around the world to fight against Covid-19."
