        "COVID-19 is a serious viral infection that struck the world in December 2019 starting from Wuhan in China, spreading subsequently to all over the world. The disease has baffled scientists and doctors worldwide in terms of its presentation, behaviour, and treatment options till now. A low mortality rate is the only relief we get so far from COVID-19 in terms of numbers. Treatment options have gradually streamlined to steroids and very few FDA approved antiviral as well as plasma therapy and supportive treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are used to tide over any impending cytokine storm but are not equally effective in all patients. Ventilation support is invariably required for moderate to severe disease varying from a simple High Flow non-rebreathing mask to BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) and HFNO (High-Flow Nasal Oxygen) extending to full-fledge ventilation via a Mechanical Ventilator. Because of the non-availability of satisfactory treatment so far, many researchers from different biomedical fields are looking for alternative therapeutic strategies to manage the pandemic. One such therapeutic approach showing a ray of hope to combat COVID-19 infection is Mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Mesenchymal cells have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory as well as regenerative properties and various preliminary studies have shown that MSCs can reverse the lung damage and overcome the cytokine storm incited by COVID-19 infection. Also, it has improved the recovery rate of critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. In this review, we will discuss the possibility and relevance of MSCs in COVID-19 treatment and preview of various MSCs clinical trials."
