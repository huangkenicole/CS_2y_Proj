      "AbstractText": [
        "The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 has hugely created an economic imbalance worldwide. With the exponential increase in the number of cases and to keep in check on the community transmission, there is high demand and acute shortage of diagnostic kits. The pooled-sample strategy turns out to be the promising strategy intended to determine the optimal testing for specimens with limited resources and without losing the test sensitivity and specificity. The study was performed with standard molecular biology graded lab equipment, FDA-approved COVID-19 RNA extraction, and SARS-CoV-2 tests kits.",
        "The study aims to comparatively analyze the pooling strategy of the naso-oropharyngeal specimen sample and RNA extracted from the same patient samples in the pool of 3,5, and 8 with no significant loss in test usability. Another primary focus of the study was detection of low or borderline SARS-CoV-2 positives in the pooling strategy. A total of 300 samples (240 positives and 60 negatives) were tested for 3, 5, and 8 pools of specimen samples and RNA elutes.",
        "The comparative analysis determined the sensitivity for three and five pool strategy to be above 98% and eight pool strategy to be 100%.",
        "The RNA elutes pooling strategy concordance rate is better than that of specimen pooling with 100% specificity. Thus, in the substantial crisis of resources with the global pandemic, pooling approaches for SARS-CoV-2 can be practical in a low prevalence rate of 5%."
