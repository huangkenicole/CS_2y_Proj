        "Diagnostic evaluation of the ID NOW coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) assay in various real-world settings among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.",
        "Depending on the setting, the ID NOW testing was performed using oropharyngeal swabs (OPSs) taken from patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, asymptomatic close contacts, or asymptomatic individuals as part of outbreak point prevalence screening. From January to April 2021, a select number of sites switched from using OPS to combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab (O\u00a0+\u00a0NS) for ID NOW testing. For every individual tested, two swabs were collected by a health care worker: one swab (OPS or O\u00a0+\u00a0NS) for ID NOW testing and a separate swab (OPS or nasopharyngeal swab) for RT-PCR.",
        "A total of 129\u00a0112 paired samples were analysed (16\u00a0061 RT-PCR positive). Of these, 81\u00a0697 samples were from 42 COVID-19 community collection sites, 16\u00a0924 samples were from 69 rural hospitals, 1927 samples were from nine emergency shelters and addiction treatment facilities, 23\u00a0802 samples were from six mobile units that responded to 356 community outbreaks, and 4762 O\u00a0+\u00a0NS swabs were collected from three community collection sites and one emergency shelter. The ID NOW assay sensitivity was the highest among symptomatic individuals presenting to community collection sites (92.5%; 95% CI, 92.0-93.0%) and the lowest for asymptomatic individuals associated with community outbreaks (73.9%; 95% CI, 69.8-77.7%). Specificity was >99% in all populations tested.",
        "The sensitivity of ID NOW severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing is the highest when used in symptomatic community populations not seeking medical care. Sensitivity and positive predictive value drop by approximately 10% when tested on asymptomatic populations. Using combined oropharyngeal and nasal swabs did not improve the performance of ID NOW assay."
