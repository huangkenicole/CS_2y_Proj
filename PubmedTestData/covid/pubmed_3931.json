        "Since the start of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several episodes of human-to-animal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission have been described in different countries. The role of pets, especially domestic dogs, in the COVID-19 epidemiology is highly questionable and needs further investigation. In this study, we report a case of COVID-19 in a French dog living in close contact with its owners who were COVID-19 patients. The dog presented rhinitis and was sampled 1 week after its owners (a man and a woman) were tested positive for COVID-19. The nasal swabs for the dog tested remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) 1 month following the first diagnosis. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detectable 12 days after the first diagnosis and persisted for at least 5 months as tested using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and automated western blotting. The whole-genome sequences from the dog and its owners were 99%-100% identical (with the man and the woman's sequences, respectively) and matched the B.1.160 variant of concern (Marseille-4 variant), the most widespread in France at the time the dog was infected. This study documents the first detection of B.1.160 in pets (a dog) in France, and the first canine genome recovery of the B.1.160 variant of global concern. Moreover, given the enhanced infectivity and transmissibility of the Marseille-4 variant for humans, this case also highlights the risk that pets may potentially play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and may transmit the infection to humans. We have evidence of human-to-dog transmission of the Marseille-4 variant since the owners were first to be infected. Finally, owners and veterinarians must be vigilent for canine COVID-19 when dogs are presented with respiratory clinical signs."
