        "In late 2019, a virus subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and led to a worldwide pandemic of the disease termed coronavirus disease 2019. The global health threat posed by this pandemic led to an extremely rapid and robust mobilization of the scientific and medical communities as evidenced by the publication of more than 10,000 peer-reviewed articles and thousands of preprints in the first year of the pandemic alone. With the publication of the initial genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the proteomics community immediately joined this effort publishing, to date, more than 100 peer-reviewed proteomics studies and submitting many more preprints to preprint servers. In this review, we focus on peer-reviewed articles published on the proteome, glycoproteome, and glycome of SARS-CoV-2. At a basic level, proteomic studies provide valuable information on quantitative aspects of viral infection course; information on the identities, sites, and microheterogeneity of post-translational modifications; and, information on protein-protein interactions. At a biological systems level, these studies elucidate host cell and tissue responses, characterize antibodies and other immune system factors in infection, suggest biomarkers that may be useful for diagnosis and disease-course monitoring, and help in the development or repurposing of potential therapeutics. Here, we summarize results from selected early studies to provide a perspective on the current rapidly evolving literature."
