      "AbstractText": [
        "The outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment have improved due to vaccination and the establishment of better treatment regimens. However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, and the corresponding changes in the characteristics of the disease present new challenges in patient management. This study aimed to analyze predictors of COVID-19 severity caused by the delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.",
        "We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who were admitted for COVID-19 at Yokohama City University Hospital from August 2021 to March 2022.",
        "A total of 141 patients were included in this study. Of these, 91 had moderate COVID-19, whereas 50 had severe COVID-19. There were significant differences in sex, vaccination status, dyspnea, sore throat symptoms, and body mass index (BMI) (p <0.0001, p <0.001, p <0.001, p = 0.02, p< 0.0001, respectively) between the moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Regarding comorbidities, smoking habit and renal dysfunction were significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.007 and p = 0.01, respectively). Regarding laboratory data, only LDH level on the first day of hospitalization was significantly different between the two groups (p<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that time from the onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization, BMI, smoking habit, and LDH level were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.03, p = 0.039, p = 0.008, p<0.001, respectively). The cut-off value for the time from onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization was four days (sensitivity, 0.73; specificity, 0.70).",
        "Time from the onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization is the most important factor in the prevention of the aggravation of COVID-19 caused by the delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Appropriate medical management within four days after the onset of COVID-19 is essential for preventing the progression of COVID-19, especially in patients with smoking habits."
