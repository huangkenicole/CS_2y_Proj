        "Viral infections pose intense burdens to healthcare systems and global economies. The correct diagnosis of viral diseases represents a crucial step towards effective treatments and control. Biosensors have been successfully implemented as accessible and accurate detection tests for some of the most important viruses. While most biosensors are based on physical or chemical interactions of cell-free components, the complexity of living microorganisms holds a poorly explored potential for viral detection in the face of the advances of synthetic biology. Indeed, cell-based biosensors have been praised for their versatility and economic attractiveness, however, yeast platforms for viral disease diagnostics are still limited to indirect antibody recognition. Here we propose a novel strategy for viral detection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which combines the transductive properties of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with the Yeast Surface Display (YSD) of specific enzymes enrolled in the viral recognition process. The GPCR/YSD complex might allow for active virus detection through a modulated signal activated by a GPCR agonist, whose concentration correlates to the viral titer. Additionally, we explore this methodology in a case study for the detection of highly pathogenic coronaviruses that share the same cell receptor upon infection (i.e. the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ACE2), as a conceptual example of the potential of the GPCR/YSD strategy for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
