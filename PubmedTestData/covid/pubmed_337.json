        "A novel coronavirus member was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, at the end of the year 2019. Initially, the infection spread locally, affecting the Wuhan people, and then expanded rapidly throughout the world. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it a global pandemic. The virus is a new strain most closely related to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13) which was not previously discovered in humans and is now\u00a0formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease syndrome that the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers. It is suggested that\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through aerosols, direct/indirect contact, and also during medical procedures and specimen handling. The infection is characterized by isolated flu-like symptoms, but there may be specific signs of fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as the loss of smell and breathing difficulty. Within this report, we tried to review the most current scientific literature published by January 2021 on various aspects of the outbreak, including virus structure, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, potential therapeutics and vaccines, and prospects. We hope this article makes a beneficial impact on public education to better deal with the SARS-CoV-2 crisis and push a step forward in the near term towards its prevention and control."
