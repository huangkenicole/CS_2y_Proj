        "The current world has changed in all shapes since the emergence of the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2) also known as COVID-19. Among the extra-pulmonary manifestations of nCoV-2, ophthalmic symptoms have less been systematically studied. The so far existing body of evidence indicates that nCoV-2 has the potential to affect both anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Albeit, the exact mechanisms which underlie ophthalmic manifestations of nCoV-2 are yet to be elucidated.",
        "The present brief review is an attempt to put together and highlight the significant yet limited number of studies which have spotlighted ophthalmic issues in nCoV-2 patients using a systematic literature search strategy.",
        "All case series or reports (including both published and preprint articles) which described ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and/or documented testing of SARS-COV-2 in ocular secretions via various sampling or detection methods were sought to be included.",
        "The ophthalmic presentations in SARS-COV-2 are often found to be salient. Raising awareness in this respect may help defining evidencebased protective measures in today's practice of ophthalmology and allied disciplines."
