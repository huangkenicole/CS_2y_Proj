      "AbstractText": [
        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is one of the major components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and participates in the physiological functions of the cardiovascular system and lungs. Recent studies identified ACE2 as the receptor for the S-protein of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and thus acts as the gateway for viral entry into the human body. Virus infection causes an imbalance in the RAS axis and induces acute lungs injury and fibrosis. Various factors regulate ACE2 expression patterns as well as control its epigenetic status at both transcription and translational levels. This review is mainly focused on the impact of environmental toxicants, drugs, endocrine disruptors, and hypoxia as controlling parameters for ACE2 expression and its possible modulation by epigenetic changes which are marked by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) profile. Furthermore, we have emphasized on interventions of various phytochemicals and bioactive compounds as epidrugs that regulate ACE2-S-protein interaction and thereby curb viral infection. Since ACE2 is an important component of the RAAS axis and a crucial entry point of SARS-CoV-2, the dynamics of ACE2 expression in response to various extrinsic and intrinsic factors are of contemporary relevance. We have collated updated information on ACE2 expression modulated by epidrugs, and urge to take over further studies on these important physiological regulators to unravel many more systemic linkages related to both metabolic and infectious diseases, in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular for further development of targeted interventions."
