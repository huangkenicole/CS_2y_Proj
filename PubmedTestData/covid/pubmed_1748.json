        "This study monitored the presence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA on environmental surfaces in hospital wards housing patients with mild, severe, and convalescent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. From 29 October to 4 December 2021, a total of 787 surface samples were randomly collected from a General Ward, Intensive Care Unit, and Convalescent Ward at a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in China. All of the samples were used for SARS-Cov-2 detection. Descriptive statistics were generated and differences in the positivity rates between the wards were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests, Yates chi-squared tests, and Pearson's chi-squared tests. During the study period, 787 surface samples were collected, among which, 46 were positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA (5.8%). The positivity rate of the contaminated area in the Intensive Care Unit was higher than that of the General Ward (23.5% vs. 10.4%, P<0.05). The positivity rate of the semi-contaminated area in the Intensive Care Unit (4.5%) was higher than that of the General Ward (1.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). In the clean area, only one sample was positive in the Intensive Care Unit (0.5%). None of the samples were positive in the Convalescent Ward. These findings reveal that the SARS-Cov-2 RNA environmental pollution in the Intensive Care Unit was more serious than that in the General Ward, while the pollution in the Convalescent Ward was the lowest. Strict disinfection measures, personal protection, and hand hygiene are necessary to limit the spread of SARS-Cov-2."
