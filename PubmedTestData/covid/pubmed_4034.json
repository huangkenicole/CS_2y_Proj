        "In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Moreover, it has become a global pandemic. This is of great value in describing the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients in detail and looking for markers which are significant to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",
        "In this multicenter, retrospective study, 476 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from a consecutive series. After screening, a total of 395 patients were included in this study. All-cause death was the primary endpoint. All patients were followed up from admission till discharge or death.",
        "The main symptoms observed in the study included fever on admission, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Patients with lower CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell level were older and more often male compared to those with higher CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell level. Reduced CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell level was an indicator of the severity of COVID-19. Both decreased CD4<sup>+</sup>T [HR:13.659; 95%CI: 3.235-57.671] and CD8<sup>+</sup>T [HR: 10.883; 95%CI: 3.277-36.145] cell levels were associated with in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients, but only the decrease of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell level was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients.",
        "Reductions in lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets were common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases of COVID-19. It was the CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell level, not the CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell level, that reflected the severity of the patient's disease. Only reduced CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell level was independently associated with increased in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients.",
