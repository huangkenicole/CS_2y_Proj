        "The current pandemic resulted from SARS-CoV-2 still remains as the major public health concern globally. The precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is not fully understood, which remains a major hurdle for medical intervention. Here we generated an interactome profile of protein-protein interactions based on host and viral protein structural similarities information. Further computational biological study combined with Gene enrichment analysis predicted key enriched pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. The results show that axon guidance, membrane trafficking, vesicle-mediated transport, apoptosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Vpu mediated degradation of CD4 T cell, and interferon-gamma signaling are key events associated in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Further, degree centrality analysis reveals that IRF1/9/7, TP53, and CASP3, UBA52, and UBC are vital proteins for IFN-\u03b3-mediated signaling, apoptosis, and proteasomal degradation of CD4, respectively. We crafted chronological events of the virus life cycle. The SARS-CoV-2 enters through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the genome is trafficked to the early endosomes in a RAB5-dependent manner. It is predicted to replicate in a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) composed of the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome, and ERAD machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates host translational machinery by interacting with protein kinase R, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and heme-regulated inhibitor and can phosphorylate eIF2a. The virion assembly occurs in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) organized by the spike and matrix protein. Collectively, we have established a spatial link between viral entry, RNA synthesis, assembly, pathogenesis, and their associated diverse host factors, those could pave the way for therapeutic intervention."
