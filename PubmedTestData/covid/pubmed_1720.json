        "Multifunctional nature of phytochemicals and their chemical diversity has attracted attention to develop leads originated from nature to fight COVID-19. Pharmacological activities of chelerythrine and its congeners have been studied and reported in the literature. This compound simultaneously has two key therapeutic effects for the treatment of COVID-19, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Chelerythrine can prevent hyper-inflammatory immune response through regulating critical signaling pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as alteration in Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and p38 MAPK activities. In addition, chelerythrine has a strong protein kinase C-\u03b1/-\u03b2 inhibitory activity suitable for cerebral vasospasm prevention and eryptosis reduction, as well as beneficial effects in suppressing pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In terms of antiviral activity, chelerythrine can fight with SARS-CoV-2 through various mechanisms, such as direct-acting mechanism, viral RNA-intercalation, and regulation of host-based antiviral targets. Although chelerythrine is toxic in vitro, the in vivo toxicity is significantly reduced due to its structural conversion to alkanolamine. Its multifunctional action makes chelerythrine a prominent compound for the treatment of COVID-19. Considering precautions related to the toxicity at higher doses, it is expected that this compound is useful in combination with proper antivirals to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms."
