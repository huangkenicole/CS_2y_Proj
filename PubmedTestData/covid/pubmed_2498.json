        "Owing to the high mortality and strong infection ability of COVID-19, the early rapid diagnosis is essential to reduce the risk of severe symptoms and the loss of lung function. In clinic, the commonly used detection methods, including the computed tomography (CT) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are often time-consuming with bulky instruments, which normally require more than one hour to report the results. To shorten the analytical period for testing the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2), we proposed an ultrafast and ultrasensitive DNA sensors to achieve an accurate determination of the DNA sequence by the RNA reverse transcription (rtDNA) of the SARS-CoV-2. A nanocubic architecture of the MnFe@Pt crystals was constructed to integrate both electrocatalysis and conductivity to greatly improve the biosensing performance. After the immobilization of a specific capture and report DNA on above nanocomposite, the rtDNA can be rapidly caught to the DNA sensor to form a double-helix structure, thus generating the current signal change. Within only 10\u00a0min, the as-prepared DNA sensors exhibited ultralow detection limit (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-20</sup> M) and wide linear detection range, together with an outstanding selectivity among various interfering substances."
