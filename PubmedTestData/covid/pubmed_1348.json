        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with increasing numbers of cases worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or through direct and indirect contact with an infected person. The possibility of potential faecal-oral transmission was investigated in this study. We collected 258 faecal specimens from nine provinces in China and detected the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR. Vero cells were used to isolate the virus from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive samples, after which sequencing of Spike gene in eight samples was performed. In all, 93 of 258 (36%) stool samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rates of critical, severe, moderate, and mild patients were 54.4%, 56.1%, 30.8%, and 33.3%, respectively. The content of nucleic acid increased within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease. From the perspective of clinical typing, the nucleic acid can be detected in the faeces of critical patients within two weeks and until four to five weeks in the faeces of severe and mild patients. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from stool specimens of two severe patients. Four non-synonymous mutations in Spike gene were newly detected in three stool samples. A small number of patients had strong faecal detoxification ability. The live virus in faeces could be an important source of contamination, which may lead to infection and further spread in areas with poor sanitary conditions. The findings of this study have public health significance and they should be considered when formulating disease control strategies."
