        "During the early stages of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in South Africa, one of many challenges included availability of control material for laboratory proficiency testing programs. Proficiency testing control material using live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or RNA extracted from cell culture was either biohazardous or costly, particularly in resource-limited settings. This study reports the development and application of a noninfectious SARS-CoV-2 biomimetic Mycobacterium smegmatis strain that mimics a positive result in the GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2 Xpert Xpress cartridge. Nucleotide sequences located in genes encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the nucleocapsid, and the envelope proteins were used. The resulting biomimetic strain was prepared as a positive proficiency testing control and distributed in South Africa for verification of laboratories before their testing of clinical specimens. Between April and December 2020, a total of 151 GeneXpert instruments with 2532 modules were verified to bring COVID-19 mass testing in South Africa online. An average concordance of 98.6% was noted in the entire laboratory network, allowing identification of false-positive/false-negative results and instrument errors. This noninfectious, easily scalable proficiency testing control material became available within 2 months after the start of the pandemic in South Africa and represents a useful approach to consider for other diseases and future pandemics."
