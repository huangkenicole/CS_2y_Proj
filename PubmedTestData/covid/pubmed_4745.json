        "The demand for testing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the production of several different commercial platforms and laboratory-developed assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This has created several challenges, including, but not limited to, the standardization of diagnostic testing, utilization of cycle threshold (<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) values for quantitation and clinical interpretation, and data harmonization. Using reference standards consisting of a linear range of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations quantitated by viral culture-based methods and droplet digital PCR, we investigated the commutability and standardization of SARS-CoV-2 quantitation across different laboratories in the United States. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values generated on multiple reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) platforms and analyzed PCR efficiencies, linearity, gene targets, and <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value agreement. Our results demonstrate the inappropriateness of using SARS-CoV-2 <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values without established standards for viral quantitation. Further, we emphasize the importance of using reference standards and controls validated to independent assays, to compare results across different testing platforms and move toward better harmonization of COVID-19 quantitative test results. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing has resulted in an explosion of analytical tests with very different approaches and designs. The variability in testing modalities, compounded by the lack of available commercial reference materials for standardization early in the pandemic, has led to several challenges regarding data harmonization for viral quantitation. In this study, we assessed multiple commercially available RT-PCR platforms across different laboratories within the United States using standardized reference materials characterized by viral culture methods and droplet digital PCR. We observed variability in the results generated by different instruments and laboratories, further emphasizing the importance of utilizing validated reference standards for quantitation, to better harmonize SARS-CoV-2 test results."
