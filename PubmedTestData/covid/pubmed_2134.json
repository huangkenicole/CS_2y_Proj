        "Findings collected over two and a half years of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the level immunity resulting from vaccination and infection is insufficient to stop the circulation of new genetic variants. The short-term decline in morbidity was followed by a steady increase. The early identification of new genetic lineages that will require vaccine adaptation in the future is an important research target. In this study, we summarised data on the variability of genetic line composition throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Moscow, Russia, and evaluated the virological and epidemiological features of dominant variants in the context of selected vaccine prophylaxes. The prevalence of the Omicron variant highlighted the low effectiveness of the existing immune layer in preventing infection, which points to the necessity of optimising the antigens used in vaccines in Moscow. Logistic growth curves showing the rate at which the new variant displaces the previously dominant variants may serve as early indicators for selecting candidates for updated vaccines, along with estimates of efficacy, reduced viral neutralising activity against the new strains, and viral load in previously vaccinated patients."
