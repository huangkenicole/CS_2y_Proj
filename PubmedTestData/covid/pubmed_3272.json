        "SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is shed in the stool of 55-70% of infected individuals and can be detected in community wastewater up to 7\u2009days before people present with COVID-19 symptoms. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may serve as a lead indicator of increased community transmission. Here, we monitored viral concentrations in samples collected from nine municipal wastewater facilities in New Hampshire (NH) and Vermont (VT).Twenty-four-h composite primary influent wastewater samples were collected from nine municipal wastewater treatment facilities twice per week for 5\u2009months (late September 2020 to early February 2021). Wastewater was centrifuged for 30 min at 4600\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>g</i>, then the supernatant was frozen until further analysis. Once thawed, samples were concentrated, extracted, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcriptase-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) detection methods. Active case counts for each municipality were tracked from the NH and VT state COVID-19 dashboards. We received a total of 283 wastewater samples from all sites during the study period. Viral RNA was detected in 175/283 (61.8%) samples using RT-qPCR and in 195/283 (68.9%) samples using RT-ddPCR. All nine sites showed positivity in the wastewater, with 8/9 (88.8%) sites having over 50% of their samples test positive over the course of the study. Larger municipalities, such as Nashua, Concord, and Lebanon, NH, showed that SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the wastewater can precede spikes in active COVID-19 case counts by as much as 7 days. Smaller municipalities, such as Woodsville, NH and Hartford, VT, showed sporadic SARS-COV-2 detection and did not always precede a rise in active case counts. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples from all 9 municipalities tested, including cities and small towns within this region, and showed wastewater positivity as an early indicator of active case count increases in some regions. Some of the smaller rural municipalities with low case counts may require more frequent sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater before a case surge. With timely collection and analysis of wastewater samples, a community could potentially respond to results by increasing public health initiatives, such as tightening mask mandates and banning large indoor gatherings, to mitigate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite vaccination efforts, the delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have caused global surges of COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it is important to find new ways of tracking early signs of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The manuscript outlines how to collect wastewater from treatment facilities, concentrate the virus in a dilute wastewater sample, and detect it using two sensitive PCR-based methods. It also describes important trends in SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater of a rural region of the United States from Fall 2020 - Winter 2021 and demonstrates the utility of wastewater monitoring as a leading indicator of active SARS-CoV-2 cases. Monitoring changes in concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater may offer an early indicator of increased case counts and enable appropriate public health actions to be taken."
