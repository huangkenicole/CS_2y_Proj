        "To estimate the prevalence rate of ocular symptoms and the positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of patients diagnosed with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).",
        "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was done based on PubMed, Embase, MedRxiv, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes are the prevalence rate of conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion and the positive rate of conjunctival swab samples. Rates were expressed as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).",
        "A total of 12 studies with 1930 participants were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence rate of conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion was 8% (95% CI: 5%-12%). 1% (95% CI: 1%-4%) of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with conjunctivitis/conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The pooled positive rate of conjunctival swab samples was 3% (95% CI: 2%-5%). We also assessed other ocular symptoms reported in the 12 studies, including foreign body sensation, increased secretion, and eye itching. The pooled prevalence rates were 6% (95% CI: 3%-10%), 10% (95% CI: 8%-12%), and 9% (95% CI: 7%-10%), respectively.",
        "The evidence on the positive rate of conjunctival swab samples and the prevalence rates of ocular symptoms indicated that COVID-19 ocular transmission was possible but less likely."
