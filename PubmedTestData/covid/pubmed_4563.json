        "<b>Introduction</b>: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Indonesia remain high. The virus can bind with ACE2 receptor which is not only found in the lungs, but also in the digestive tract. Thus, it allows SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gastrointestinal tract, gastrointestinal manifestations, and detection of viral RNA on anal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There hasn't been similar study about the role of anal swab in Indonesia yet. Therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between SARS-COV-2 anal swab PCR with gastrointestinal clinical manifestations, and the severity of COVID-19 in Indonesia. <b>Methods</b>: This is an analytical study with cross-sectional design. Samples were obtained from hospitalized COVID-19 patients from July 2020 to January 2021. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, severity, and SARS-CoV-2 anal swabs PCR were collected using case report form. <b>Results</b>: A total of136 patients were analyzed. 52 patients (38.2%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 anal swabs PCR and 84 patients (61.8%) had negative results. The most common gastrointestinal clinical manifestations were nausea and vomiting in 69 patients (50.7%), anorexia in 62 patients (45.6%), and abdominal pain in 31 patients (22.8%). There were 114 patients (83,8%) classified as mild-moderate symptoms and 22 patients (16,2%) classified as severe-critical symptoms. There was a statistically significant relationship between the gastrointestinal tract SARS-CoV-2 infection and gastrointestinal clinical manifestations (P=0.031). There was no statistically significant relationship between the gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 infection (P = 0.844). <b>Conclusions</b>: This study showed there is a significant relationship between SARS-CoV-2 anal swab PCR with gastrointestinal clinical manifestations. There is no significant relationship between anal swab PCR with the severity of COVID-19 infection."
