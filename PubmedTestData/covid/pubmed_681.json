        "Homeopathy has had documented success treating epidemics in the last two centuries. We aimed to obtain a clear homeopathic clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and postulate the genus epidemicus of the disease in order to inform and enhance future treatment and prophylaxis options.",
        "We conducted a prospective case series study, collecting data from 19 homeopaths in Catalonia, Spain, from patients who presented with fever and/or cough and/or breathlessness and/or confirmed COVID-19 infection or close contact with a confirmed case. We included 107 patients, and data were recorded through a checklist questionnaire on the day of the case analysis and at day 10-15 after commencing treatment. Symptoms were collected and analyzed with the help of homeopathic repertories.",
        "A total of 103 cases were mild or moderate; four were severe. The severe cases were excluded from the analysis and the 103 mild and moderate cases were analyzed and a clear overall clinical picture with mental, general, and particular symptoms was achieved. Eighty-eight cases had a complete recorded follow-up. The most prescribed medicines were <i>Bry</i>, <i>Ars</i>, <i>Phos</i> and <i>Gels</i>, whilst those with the best rates of good response were <i>Sulph</i>, <i>Puls</i> and <i>Bry</i>. Time to full recovery after homeopathic treatment ranged from 3.5 to 14.4 days, depending on the medicine used. The potency 200c was associated with faster rates of full recovery and a lesser need to change remedy.",
        "We have defined the symptomatic homeopathic characteristics of mild and moderate COVID-19 in Spain and established a set of medicines that might be useful to consider as effective genus epidemicus."
