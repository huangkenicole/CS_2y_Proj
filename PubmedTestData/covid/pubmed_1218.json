      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 has caused more than 140 million infections worldwide by the end of April 2021. As an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 underwent constant evolution that produced novel variants carrying mutation conferring fitness advantages. The current prevalent D614G variant, with glycine substituted for aspartic acid at position 614 in the spike glycoprotein, is one of such variants that became the main circulating strain worldwide in a short period of time. Over the past year, intensive studies from all over the world had defined the epidemiological characteristics of this highly contagious variant and revealed the underlying mechanisms. This review aims at presenting an overall picture of the impacts of D614G mutation on virus transmission, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of D614G in virus pathogenicity, and providing insights into the development of effective therapeutics."
