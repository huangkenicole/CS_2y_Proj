        "A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is causing the severe acute pneumonia (COVID-19) and rapid spread nationally and internationally, resulting in a major global health emergency. Chinese governments and scientists have implemented a series of rigorous measures and scientific research to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is still no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. It has been proven that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts an important role in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Although the therapeutic effects of these TCM formulas are attractive, the molecular mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. An emerging strategy of systems pharmacology has been proposed to be a promising method to interpret drug action in complex biological systems and quickly screen out the bioactive compounds from TCM to treat treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in this study, the epidemiology, TCM therapy, and the systems pharmacology-based method for TCM are reviewed for COVID-19 to provide a perspective for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further efforts should be made to reduce disease burden and improve the ability to design antiviral drugs and vaccines, which will benefit the health care system, economic development and even social stability."
