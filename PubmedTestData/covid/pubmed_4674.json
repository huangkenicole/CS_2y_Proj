        "Massive-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing using the SwabSeq diagnostic platform came with quality assurance challenges due to the novelty and scale of sequencing-based testing. The SwabSeq platform relies on accurate mapping between specimen identifiers and molecular barcodes to match a result back to a patient specimen. To identify and mitigate mapping errors, we instituted quality control using placement of negative controls within a rack of patient samples. We designed 2-dimensional paper templates to fit over a 96-position rack of specimens with holes to show the control tube placements. We designed and 3-dimensionally printed plastic templates that fit onto 4 racks of patient specimens and provide accurate indications of the correct control tube placements. The final plastic templates dramatically reduced plate mapping errors from 22.55% in January 2021 to less than 1% after implementation and training in January 2021. We show how 3D printing can be a cost-effective quality assurance tool to mitigate human error in the clinical laboratory."
