      "AbstractText": [
        "Recently, we have experienced a serious pandemic. Despite significant technological advances in molecular technologies, it is very challenging to slow down the infection spread. It appeared that due to globalization, SARS-CoV-2 spread easily and adapted to new environments or geographical or weather zones. Additionally, new variants are emerging that show different infection potential and clinical outcomes. On the other hand, we have some experience with other pandemics and some solutions in virus elimination that could be adapted. This is of high importance since, as the latest reports demonstrate, vaccine technology might not follow the new, mutated virus outbreaks. Thus, identification of novel strategies and markers or diagnostic methods is highly necessary. For this reason, we present some of the latest views on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 therapeutic strategies and raise a solution based on miRNA. We believe that in the face of the rapidly increasing global situation and based on analogical studies of other viruses, the possibility of using the biological potential of miRNA technology is very promising. It could be used as a promising diagnostic and prognostic factor, as well as a therapeutic target and tool."
