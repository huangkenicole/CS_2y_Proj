        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread and poses a major threat to public health worldwide. The whole genome sequencing plays a crucial role in virus surveillance and evolutionary analysis. In this study, five genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from nasopharyngeal swab samples from Zhengzhou, China. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, multiplex PCR was performed with two primer pools to produce the overlapped amplicons of ~1,200 bp. The viral genomes were obtained with 96% coverage using nanopore sequencing. Forty-five missense nucleotide mutations were identified; out of these, 5 mutations located at <i>Nsp2</i>, <i>Nsp3</i>, <i>Nsp14</i>, and <i>ORF10</i> genes occurred with a <0.1% frequency in the global dataset. On the basis of mutation profiles, five genomes were clustered into two sublineages (B.1.617.2 and AY.31) or subclades (21A and 21I). The phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes from several regions of China and Myanmar revealed that five patients had different viral transmission chains. Taken together, we established a nanopore sequencing platform for genetic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and identified the variants circulating in Zhengzhou during August 2021. Our study provided crucial support for government policymaking and prevention and control of COVID-19."
