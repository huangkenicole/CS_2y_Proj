      "AbstractText": [
        "The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began at the end of 2019. COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patients with COVID-19 may exhibit poor clinical outcomes. Some patients with severe COVID-19 experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or a cytokine storm-elevated levels of hyperactivated immune cells-and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. This severe inflammatory response can lead to organ damage/failure and even death. The inflammasome is an intracellular immune complex that is responsible for the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in various human diseases. Recently, there has been a growing number of studies revealing a link between the inflammasome and COVID-19. Therefore, this article summarizes the current literature regarding the inflammasome complex and COVID-19."
