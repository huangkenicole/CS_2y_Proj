        "In December 2019, a new infectious disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attributed to the new virus named severe scute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected. The gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the viral identification in nasopharyngeal swab by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Few data on the role of imaging are available in the pediatric population. Similarly, considering that symptomatic therapy is adequate in most of the pediatric patients with COVID-19, few pediatric pharmacological studies are available. The main aim of this review is to describe and discuss the scientific literature on various imaging approaches and therapeutic management in children and adolescents affected by COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are less severe in children than in adults and as a consequence the radiologic findings are less marked. If imaging is needed, chest radiography is the first imaging modality of choice in the presence of moderate-to-severe symptoms. Regarding therapy, acetaminophen or ibuprofen are appropriate for the vast majority of pediatric patients. Other drugs should be prescribed following an appropriate individualized approach. Due to the characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatric age, the importance of strengthening the network between hospital and territorial pediatrics for an appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic management represents a priority."
