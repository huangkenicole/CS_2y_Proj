        "Since the end of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus started to spread in different countries, leading to a world-wide pandemia, with today's infection numbers of more than 690 million and with a case fatality rate of more than 6.9 million. In addition, about 65 million patients suffer from post/long-Covid syndromes after having infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or variants thereof. This review highlights the biology of the virus, summarizes our knowledge of some of the viral mechanisms that counteract our immune responses, and finally also discusses the different vaccines and their specific safety profiles. Also, the possibility to fight this virus with recently available drugs (Veklury, Lagevrio and Paxlovid) will be discussed. All these data clearly argue that SARS-CoV-2 variants still exhibit a dangerous potential-although with a lower case fatality rate-and that vaccination in combination with drug intake upon infection may help to lower the risk of developing chronic or temporary autoimmune diseases."
