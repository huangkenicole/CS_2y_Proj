        "Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is necessary to reopen schools safely.",
        "We measured SARS-CoV-2 infection in 320 learners [10.5 \u00b1 2.1 (sd); 7-17\u2009y.o.] at four diverse schools with either remote or on-site learning. Schools A and B served low-income Hispanic learners; school C served many special-needs learners, and all provided predominantly remote instruction. School D served middle- and upper-income learners, with predominantly on-site instruction. Testing occurred in the fall (2020), and 6-8 weeks later during the fall-winter surge (notable for a tenfold increase in COVID-19 cases). Immune responses and mitigation fidelity were also measured.",
        "We found SARS-CoV-2 infections in 17 learners only during the surge. School A (97% remote learners) had the highest infection (10/70, 14.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and IgG positivity rates (13/66, 19.7%). School D (93% on-site learners) had the lowest infection and IgG positivity rates (1/63, 1.6%). Mitigation compliance [physical distancing (mean 87.4%) and face-covering (91.3%)] was remarkably high at all schools. Documented SARS-CoV-2-infected learners had neutralizing antibodies (94.7%), robust IFN-\u03b3\u2009+\u2009T cell responses, and reduced monocytes.",
        "Schools can implement successful mitigation strategies across a wide range of student diversity. Despite asymptomatic to mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, children generate robust humoral and cellular immune responses.",
        "Successful COVID-19 mitigation was implemented across a diverse range of schools. School-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections reflect regional rates rather than remote or on-site learning. Seropositive school-aged children with asymptomatic to mild SARS-CoV-2 infections generate robust humoral and cellular immunity."
