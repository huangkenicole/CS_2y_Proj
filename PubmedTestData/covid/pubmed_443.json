      "AbstractText": [
        "To explore the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Algeria, a dataset comprising ninety-five genomes originating from SARS-CoV-2 sampled from Algeria and other countries worldwide, from 24 December 2019, through 4 March 2021, was thoroughly examined. While performing a multi-component analysis regarding the Algerian outbreak, the toolkit of phylogenetic, phylogeographic, haplotype, and genomic analysis were effectively implemented. We estimated the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) in reference to the Algerian pandemic and highlighted the multiple introductions of the disease and the missing data depicted in the transmission loop. In addition, we emphasized the significant role played by local and international travels in disease dissemination. Most importantly, we unveiled mutational patterns, the effect of unique mutations on corresponding proteins, and the relatedness regarding the Algerian sequences to other sequences worldwide. Our results revealed individual amino-acid replacements such as the deleterious replacement A23T in the <i>orf3a</i> gene in Algeria_EPI_ISL_418241. Additionally, a connection between Algeria_EPI_ISL_420037 and sequences originating from the USA was observed through a USA characteristic amino-acid replacement T1004I in the <i>nsp3</i> gene, found in the aforementioned Algerian sequence. Similarly, successful tracing could be established, such as Algeria/G37318-8849/2020|EPI_ISL_766863, which was imported from Saudi Arabia during the pilgrimage. Lastly, we assessed the Algerian mitigation measures regarding disease containment using statistical analyses."
