        "Information regarding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric oncology is limited. We conducted a systematic review of the available published literature on children with cancer affected by COVID-19. The last date of the study search was October 20, 2020, and 33 studies comprising 226 children were included for the final analysis. Data were extracted in a predefined data collection form, and the variables were extracted and analyzed. Patients with hematological malignancies were more in number. Males and children on intensive treatment were more frequently affected. Fever was the commonest symptom. The disease was asymptomatic/mild in 48% and severe in 9.6%. Consolidation, peribronchial cuffing, and consolidation with ground glass opacities were the common imaging findings. Hydroxychloroquine was the most frequently used drug for COVID-19. About 10% of children required intensive care, and about 32% had oxygen requirements. The percentage of children who died due to COVID-19 was 4.9%. The severity, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 in pediatric oncology were more compared to the general pediatric population. This information can help in risk stratification for the management of COVID-19."
