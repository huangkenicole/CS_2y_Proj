        "Since its emergence in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally, causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the fall of 2020, the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) was detected in England and spread rapidly, outcompeting the previous lineage. Yet, very little is known about the underlying modifications of the infection process that can explain this selective advantage. Here, we try to quantify how the Alpha variant differed from its predecessor on two phenotypic traits: The transmission rate and the duration of infectiousness. To this end, we analyzed the joint epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics as a function of the Stringency Index, a measure of the amount of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions. Assuming that these control measures reduce contact rates and transmission, we developed a two-step approach based on ${{SEIR}}$ models and the analysis of a combination of epidemiological and evolutionary information. First, we quantify the link between the Stringency Index and the reduction in viral transmission. Second, based on a novel theoretical derivation of the selection gradient in an ${{SEIR}}$ model, we infer the phenotype of the Alpha variant from its frequency changes. We show that its selective advantage is more likely to result from a higher transmission than from a longer infectious period. Our work illustrates how the analysis of the joint epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases can help understand the phenotypic evolution driving pathogen adaptation."
