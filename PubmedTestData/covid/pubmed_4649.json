        "Data on the impact of biologics and immunomodulators on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes remain scarce.",
        "We sought to determine whether patients taking tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or methotrexate are at increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes.",
        "In this large comparative cohort study, real-time searches and analyses were performed on adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were treated with TNFis or methotrexate compared with those who were not treated. The likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were compared between groups with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors.",
        "More than 53 million (53,511,836) unique patient records were analyzed, of which 32,076 (0.06%) had a COVID-19-related diagnosis documented starting after January 20, 2020. Two hundred fourteen patients with COVID-19 were identified with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure compared with 31,862 patients with COVID-19 without TNFi or methotrexate exposure. After propensity matching, the likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were not significantly different between the treatment and nontreatment groups (risk ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.22], P\u00a0=\u00a0.5260 and risk ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.87 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.78], P\u00a0=\u00a0.6958, respectively).",
        "All TNFis may not behave similarly.",
        "Our study suggests that patients with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure do not have increased hospitalization or mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 without recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure."
