        "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains a global health crisis. The emergence of multiple variants with enhanced characteristics necessitates their detection and monitoring. Genome sequencing, the gold standard, faces implementation challenges due to complexity, cost, and limited throughput. The CRISPR-Cas system offers promising potential for rapid variant detection, with advantages such as speed, sensitivity, specificity, and programmability. This review provides an in-depth examination of the applications of CRISPR-Cas in mutation detection specifically for SARS-CoV-2. It begins by introducing SARS-CoV-2 and existing variant detection platforms. The principles of the CRISPR-Cas system are then clarified, followed by an exploration of three CRISPR-Cas-based mutation detection platforms, which are evaluated from different perspectives. The review discusses strategies for mutation site selection and the utilization of CRISPR-Cas, offering valuable insights for the development of mutation detection methods. Furthermore, a critical analysis of the clinical applications, advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and prospects of the CRISPR-Cas system is provided."
