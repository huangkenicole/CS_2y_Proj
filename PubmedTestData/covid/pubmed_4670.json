        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-caused COVID-19 pandemic has transmitted to humans in practically all parts of the world, producing socio-economic turmoil. There is an urgent need for precise, fast, and affordable diagnostic testing to be widely available for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations in various phases of the disease. Early diagnosis with great precision has been achieved using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar other molecular methods, but theseapproaches are costly and involve rigorous processes that are not easily obtainable. Conversely, immunoassays that detect a small number of antibodies have been employed for quick, low-cost tests, but their efficiency in diagnosing infected people has been restricted. The use of biosensors in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is vital for the COVID-19 pandemic's control. This review gives an overview of COVID-19 diagnostic approaches that are currently being developed as well as nanomaterial-based biosensor technologies, to aid future technological advancement and innovation. These approaches can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers. The ongoing research endeavors and developments in complementary technologies will play a significant role in curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and fill the knowledge gaps in current diagnostic accuracy and capacity."
