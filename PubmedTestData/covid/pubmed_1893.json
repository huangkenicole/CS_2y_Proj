        "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major threat to human health. As a unique putative protein of SARS-CoV-2, the N-terminus of ORF10 can be recognized by ZYG11B, a substrate receptor of the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2). Here we elucidated recognition mechanism of ORF10 N-terminus by ZYG11B through presenting the crystal structure of ZYG11B bound to ORF10 N-terminal peptide. Our work expands the current understanding of ORF10 interaction with ZYG11B, and may also inspire the development of novel therapies for COVID-19."
