        "Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is linked to severe organ damage. The identification and stratification of at-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is vital to providing appropriate care. This exploratory study looks for a potential liquid biopsy signal for PACS using both manual and machine learning approaches.",
        "Using a high definition single cell assay (HDSCA) workflow for liquid biopsy, we analysed 100 Post-COVID patients and 19 pre-pandemic normal donor (ND) controls. Within our patient cohort, 73 had received at least 1 dose of vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We stratified the COVID patients into 25 asymptomatic, 22 symptomatic COVID-19 but not suspected for PACS and 53 PACS suspected. All COVID-19 patients investigated in this study were diagnosed between April 2020 and January 2022 with a median 243 days (range 16-669) from diagnosis to their blood draw. We did a histopathological examination of rare events in the peripheral blood and used a machine learning model to evaluate predictors of PACS.",
        "The manual classification found rare cellular and acellular events consistent with features of endothelial cells and platelet structures in the PACS-suspected cohort. The three categories encompassing the hypothesised events were observed at a significantly higher incidence in the PACS-suspected cohort compared to the ND (p-value < 0.05). The machine learning classifier performed well when separating the NDs from Post-COVID with an accuracy of 90.1%, but poorly when separating the patients suspected and not suspected of PACS with an accuracy of 58.7%.",
        "Both the manual and the machine learning model found differences in the Post-COVID cohort and the NDs, suggesting the existence of a liquid biopsy signal after active SARS-CoV-2 infection. More research is needed to stratify PACS and its subsyndromes.",
