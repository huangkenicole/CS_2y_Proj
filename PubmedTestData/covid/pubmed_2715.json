        "Moderate and severe COVID-19 patients typically present with pneumonia. In this study we aimed to detect the occurrence of pulmonary residuals as a late sequela of COVID-19 and to identify it's predictors among moderate and severe cases.",
        "This observational prospective study involved 85 COVID-19 patients confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab, patients were recruited in the period of 1 st of June to 1 st of July. Demographic and clinical data were obtained for each patient. Chest imaging was performed initially and after 3 weeks to detect post COVID pulmonary residuals.",
        "The study population included 74 (87.1%) moderate and 11 (12.9%) severe patients. Patients with older age, male gender, high BMI and initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGOs) had more frequent post COVID-19 pulmonary residuals (P 0.003, 0.026, 0.031, 0.035) respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between patients who showed complete resolution and patients who developed pulmonary residuals regarding the lymphocyte count, serum CRP and ferritin levels (P 0.0001). After logistic regression, male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and ferritin levels were the predictors of pulmonary residuals. While the age wasn't statistically significant.",
        "38.5% of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients tend to have pulmonary residuals. Independent predictors of pulmonary residuals as a sequela of COVID-19 are male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of consolidation and mixed consolidation/GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and ferritin levels."
