        "People infected by severe acute respiratory\u00a0coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) risk\u00a0the development of not only acute coronavirus-\u00a0disease-2019 (COVID-19) - the\u00a0signs and symptoms of which range from\u00a0none to severe illness that requires intensive\u00a0treatment - but also long COVID\u00a0(i.e., chronic COVID), a cyclical, progressive,\u00a0multiphasic illness characterized by\u00a0myriad debilitating conditions that persist\u00a0long term. In some patients, those\u00a0sequelae result in psychiatric disorders\u00a0that can lead to suicide or other forms\u00a0of self-harm, incidences of which have\u00a0increased exponentially since before the\u00a0COVID pandemic. It has been suggested\u00a0that long COVID develops in an estimated\u00a010% to 35% of people diagnosed as having\u00a0COVID-19. Because the success of therapy\u00a0for either form of COVID can be complicated\u00a0by each patient's pharmacogenomic\u00a0profile, personal treatment preferences,\u00a0medical needs, and/or dosing requirements,\u00a0we have found that in some people\u00a0so afflicted, manufactured medications\u00a0are ineffective or intolerable, and that for\u00a0those individuals, a customized compound\u00a0often provides relief and promotes recovery.\u00a0The primary focus of this article is long\u00a0COVID. The pathogenesis of that disease\u00a0is reviewed, therapies for the signs and\u00a0symptoms it engenders are examined, and\u00a02 compounded formulations effective in\u00a0treating both acute and chronic COVID-19\u00a0are presented."
