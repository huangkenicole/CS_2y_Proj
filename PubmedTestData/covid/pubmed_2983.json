        "The identification and genetic sequencing of a novel coronavirus was key to the diagnosis and management of the global pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 structure and mechanism of injury is vital to explaining the disease course and the pathophysiology of the signs and symptoms observed. This particularly as the presentation, disease course, and severity are noted to be highly variable. The role of the spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor in immune response and viral entry provides great insight into current and future diagnostics and therapeutics. This article reviews the traditional diagnostic methods, which include molecular testing methods, antigen testing, and antibody testing. The gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). There have been multiple improvements to these principles to help optimize the sensitivity, specificity, and user friendliness of the method. In addition, advancements in gene sequencing and identification have been integral to identifying variants and managing outbreaks. Serological and immunological testing have made significant contributions to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, each with its unique benefits and limitations. A growing role of the laboratory is in triaging patients to determine which patients will most benefit from hospitalization and specialized care. This is imperative for rationalizing resources during outbreaks. As we learn to live with the pandemic, novel testing methods include the use of multiomic technologies and the greater utility of point of care."
