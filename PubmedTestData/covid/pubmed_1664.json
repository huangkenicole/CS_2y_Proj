        "The nCOVID-19 pandemic initiated its course of contagion from the city of Wuhan and now it has spread all over the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative virus and the infection as well as its symptoms are distributed across the multi-organ perimeters. Interactions between the host and virus governs the induction of 'cytokine storm' resulting various immunopathological consequences leading to death. Till now it has caused tens of millions of casualties and yet no credible cure has emerged to vision. This article presents a comprehensive overview on the two most promising remedial approaches that are being attempted for the management, treatment, and plausible cure of nCOVID-19. In this context, chemotherapeutic approach primarily aims to interrupt the interactions between the host and the virus causing inhibition of its entry into the host cell and/or its proliferation and suppressing the inflammatory milieu in the infected patients. On the other side, immunotherapeutic approaches aim to modulate the host immunity by fine tuning the inflammatory signaling cascades to achieve phylaxis from the virus and restoring immune-homeostasis. Considering most of the path-breaking findings, combinatorial therapy involving of chemotherapeutics as well as vaccine could usher to be a hope for all of us to eradicate the crisis."
