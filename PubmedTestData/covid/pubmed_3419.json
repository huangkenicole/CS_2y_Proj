        "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact on global human health and was declared a worldwide distributed pandemic by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 has strong transmission and pathogenicity; so far, there are more than 16,000,000 cases of infections around the world and COVID-19 has caused more than 656,000 deaths. Current data indicate risk factors of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 are older age, male sex, and chronic underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. After the outbreak of COVID-19, concern whether transplant patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 has been raised. It is inconclusive whether patients after transplantation on chronic immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to developing a more severe disease course. There is limited literature mainly aimed at post-transplantation populations whose immunity was suppressive before the disease occurred. Therefore, we attempted to systematically introduce the characteristics of transplant recipients with COVID-19, immunology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and potential therapeutic strategy."
