        "This retrospective study investigated the implications of changes in blood parameters and cellular immune function in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",
        "Records were reviewed of 85 patients admitted with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital death.",
        "Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3\u00d7109/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count > 6.3\u00d7109/L was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU/ml between the death group and survival group. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the following at baseline could significantly predict mortality: leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts.",
        "For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts that marked decrease suggest a poor outcome. Admission neutrophil count > 6.3 \u00d7109/L is independently associated with mortality. At admission, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts should receive added attention."
