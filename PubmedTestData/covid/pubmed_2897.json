        "The coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem illness associated with several metabolic derangements. Studies report that post-acute COVID-19 syndromes (PACs) continue to evolve, however, polyphagia is not uncommon. Herein, we report a rare occurrence of polyphagia in a patient following acute COVID-19 illness. A-41-year-old Ugandan female with a negative past medical history presented with complains of excessive appetite, eating large amounts of food, inability to feel satisfied, failure to control desire to eat, and weight gain 6 months following recovery from a mild episode of acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Her body mass index rose to 30 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> from 22 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> prior to suffering from COVID-19. There was no history of polyuria, polydipsia, pruritus, or prior eating disorder or related history. Investigation found that brain computed tomography scan was normal, fasting blood sugar to be 5.6 mmol/L (normal range, 3.9-7.0 mmol/L), adrenocorticotropin hormone level to be 8.763 pg/mL (normal range, 6-40 pg/mL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate to be 12 mm/hour (0-30 mm/hour), but there was an elevation in glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA<sub>1c,</sub> 7.7%). She was commenced on psychotherapy and behavioral changes with good outcomes. Polyphagia may be one of the rare PACs, requiring further research."
