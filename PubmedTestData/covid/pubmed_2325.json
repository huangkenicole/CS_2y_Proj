      "AbstractText": [
        "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan city of China has now spread to 214 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances (the Diamond Princess cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan and the Holland America's MS Zaandam cruise ship) as of October 11, 2020. The disease has been named as a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus causing the disease is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are currently about 36,754,395 confirmed COVID-19-infected cases and 1,064,838 confirmed deaths as of October 11, 2020. The study is intended to understand the origin, transmission and impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus has not been encountered by humans previously and is therefore known as a novel. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading to new areas and has become a serious challenge for the scientific community in particular and the whole world population in general. The focus of the study is based on the transmission, epidemiology, genetic makeup, and possible remedies to control and contain the disease. It also includes the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 on health care and the world economy. The present review summarizes the current knowledge highlighting the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis, and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease."
