      "AbstractText": [
        "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, manifests with a wide range of clinical symptoms that vary from mild respiratory issues to severe respiratory distress. To effectively manage and predict the outcomes of the disease, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its severity. This study focuses on analyzing and comparing the expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum, urine, and nasopharyngeal samples from patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. The aim is to identify potential associations with disease progression and discover suitable markers for diagnosis and prognosis. Our findings indicate the consistent upregulation of miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-155 in urine, serum, and nasopharyngeal samples from patients with mild COVID-19. In moderate cases, there were more significant changes in miRNA expression compared to mild cases. Specifically, miR-let-7 demonstrated upregulation, while miR-146b exhibited downregulation. The most notable alterations in miRNA expression profiles were observed in severe COVID-19 cases, with a significant upregulation of miR-223. Moreover, our analysis using Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that miR-155, miR-let-7, and miR-223 exhibited high sensitivity and specificity, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals. Overall, this comparative analysis revealed distinct patterns in miRNA expression. The overlapping expression patterns of miRNAs in urine, serum, and nasopharyngeal samples suggest their potential utility in discriminating disease status."
