        "The global COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in China in December 2019. To date, there have been approximately 3.4 million reported cases of COVID-19 and over 24,000 deaths in Thailand. In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Thailand from 2020 to 2022. Two hundred sixty-eight SARS-CoV-2 isolates, collected mostly in Bangkok from COVID-19 patients, were characterised by partial genome sequencing. Moreover, the viruses in 5,627 positive SARS-CoV-2 samples were identified as viral variants - B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.529 (Omicron/BA.1), or B.1.1.529 (Omicron/BA.2) - by multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The results revealed that B.1.36.16 caused the predominant outbreak in the second wave (December 2020-January 2021), B.1.1.7 (Alpha) in the third wave (April-June 2021), B.1.617.2 (Delta) in the fourth wave (July-December 2021), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) in the fifth wave (January-March 2022). The evolutionary rate of the viral genome was 2.60 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> (95% highest posterior density [HPD], 1.72 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> to 3.62 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. Continued molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for monitoring emerging variants with the potential to cause new COVID-19 outbreaks."
