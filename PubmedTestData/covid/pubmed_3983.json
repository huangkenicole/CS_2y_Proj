        "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic has developed there have been many parallels made with other pandemics and epidemics, such as the 1918 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. This article discusses the challenges experienced by healthcare staff working during COVID-19, and the lessons that can be learned, such as the enhanced support required for staff."
