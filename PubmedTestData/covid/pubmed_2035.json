        "We investigated whether inconclusive results could be interpreted differently depending on the situation. First, data from retesting of the initial samples from subjects without a confirmed COVID-19 history were analyzed. And by analyzing the results of consecutive tests with new specimens after receiving inconclusive results between arrivals and locals for 2 periods. As a result, 179 of 219 cases (81.7%) showed still inconclusive or weakly positive results. If contamination is well controlled in a general laboratory, the effectiveness of retesting with the same sample is limited. The rate of the subsequently positive patient was significantly higher in locals than in arrivals and periods with a higher positive rate. The inconclusive results could be interpreted differently depending on the epidemiologic background and the positive rate at that time."
