        "We assessed the association of severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) load, IgG antibody level, and prognostic indicators.Twenty-one patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were classified as having severe or mild disease on the basis of average respiratory rate during hospitalization (severe: \u226522 breaths/min; mild: <22 breaths/min). Viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytes, and D-dimer on admission and plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) index on Day 7\u00b12 after symptom onset were compared in relation to disease severity. Seven patients had severe disease and 14 had mild disease. Those with severe disease had a significantly higher IgG index (median: 3.75 vs 0.56, p=0.01) and CRP (median: 8.6 vs 1.0 mg/dL, p<0.001) and D-dimer levels (median: 1.65 vs 0.75 \u03bcg/mL; p=0.002) and a significantly lower lymphocyte count (median: 1,176 vs 666 cells/\u03bcL, p=0.005) and viral load (median: 8.7\u00d710<sup>6</sup> vs 2.3\u00d710<sup>4</sup> copies/mL, p=0.005). Furthermore, time from symptom onset to virus disappearance was significantly longer in severe patients (median: 24 vs 17 days, p=0.03). A high IgG index in the early phase of the disease was associated with severe disease and might serve as a prognostic indicator."
