        "Based on natural infection or vaccination, the protective barrier for population has been preliminarily established. However, with constant appearances of SARS-CoV-2 variants, breakthrough infection events cannot be completely avoided, and thus the diagnostic strategy is still the key to discovering epidemic sources and blocking the transmission chain. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis technologies based on nucleic acid, antigen and antibody detections have developed and extended in diversity. Under the background of work resumption and epidemic-prevention normalization during the later COVID-19 era, it is necessary for us to choose appropriate detection methods to satisfy the need of epidemic prevention and control in various scenarios. We summarized the principles and applicable characteristics of existing SARS-CoV-2 detection technologies in this paper, aimed to provide guidance for clinical and public health personnel to make targeted decisions."
