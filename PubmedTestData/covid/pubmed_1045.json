        "COVID-19 outbreak can impose serious negative impacts on the infrastructures of societies including the healthcare systems. Despite the increasing research efforts, false positive or negative results that may be associated with serologic or even RT-PCR tests, inappropriate or variable immune response, and high rates of mutations in coronavirus may negatively affect virus detection process and effectiveness of the vaccines or drugs in development. Nanotechnology-based research attempts via developing state-of-the-art techniques such as nanomechatronics ones and advanced materials including the sensors for detecting the pathogen loads at very low concentrations or site-specific delivery of therapeutics, and real-time protections against the pandemic outbreaks by nanorobots can provide outstanding biomedical breakthroughs. Considering the unique characteristics of pathogens particularly the newly-emerged ones and avoiding the exaggerated optimism or simplistic views on the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including the one-size-fits-all ones or presenting multiple medications that may be associated with synergistic toxicities rather than enhanced efficiencies might pave the way towards the development of more appropriate treatment strategies with reduced safety concerns. This paper highlights the significance of nanoplatforms against the viral disorders and their capabilities of genome editing that may facilitate taking more appropriate measures against SARS-CoV-2."
