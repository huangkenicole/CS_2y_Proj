      "AbstractText": [
        "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has become a global crisis. As of November\u00a09, COVID-19 has already spread to more than 190 countries with 50,000,000 infections and 1,250,000 deaths. Effective therapeutics and drugs are in high demand. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved with those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV. Enzymes, including RdRp, M<sup>pro</sup> /3CL<sup>pro</sup> , and PL<sup>pro</sup> , which play important roles in viral transcription and replication, have been regarded as key targets for therapies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The identification of readily available drugs for repositioning in COVID-19 therapy is a relatively rapid approach for clinical treatment, and a series of approved or candidate drugs have been proven to be efficient against COVID-19 in preclinical or clinical studies. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and the targets involved."
