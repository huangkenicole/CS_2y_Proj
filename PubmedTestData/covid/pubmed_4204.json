        "<b>Aims:</b> We present the sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. <b>Methods:</b> The\u00a0Illumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The SNPs were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit -\u00a0HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2. <b>Results:</b> All viral genome sequences of our isolates were located in lineage B under the different clusters, such as B.1 (n\u00a0=\u00a03), B.1.1 (n\u00a0=\u00a028)\u00a0and B.1.9 (n\u00a0=\u00a016). According to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data nomenclature, all of\u00a0our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. In our study, 549 total\u00a0and 53 unique SNPs were detected. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results indicate\u00a0that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences."
