        "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has spread rapidly since its discovery in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Hubei, reaching this day all the continents. This scourge is, unfortunately, in lineage with various dangerous outbreaks such as Ebola, Cholera, Spanish flu, American seasonal flu. Until today, the best solution for the moment remains prevention (Social distancing, hand disinfection, use of masks, partial or total sanitary containment, etc.); there is also the emergence of drug treatment (research and development, clinical trials, use on patients). Recent reviews emphasized the role of membrane lipids in the infectivity mechanism of SARS-COV-2. Cholesterol-rich parts of cell membranes serve as docking places of host cells for the viruses. Coronavirus 2 is a member of a virus family with lipid envelope that fuses with host cell through endocytosis, internalizing its components in the cell. In vitro cell models have shown that depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin, and particularly methyl beta cyclodextrin disturb the host cell membrane lipid composition this way, reducing the attachment of the virus to the protein receptors. This review aims to summarize the state of the art of research concerning the use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against this new virus and update work already published."
