        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of infection control measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a professional sports team using whole genome sequencing.",
        "Prospective cohort study.",
        "74 players and staff members of a Dutch professional male football team were followed from August 2020 until May 2021. A set of health and safety measures were introduced and all participants underwent regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. All positive samples were subsequently sequenced (Nanopore sequencing) to assess whether infections were acquired within the training center or in the community.",
        "Throughout the study period, 13 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 clusters (of 2 and 3 cases respectively), indicating that 3/13 cases (23%) acquired infection from another player or staff member. The first cluster was diagnosed upon enrolment, thus transmission had occurred prior to the implementation of health and safety protocols. Finally, 4 cases were diagnosed prior to symptom onset, emphasizing that frequent testing leads to early detection and isolation.",
        "These data show that a combination of regular testing and basic control measures can prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 in a professional sports team. Whole genome sequencing is an important tool to distinguish between infections introduced from the community and infections transmitted between athletes."
