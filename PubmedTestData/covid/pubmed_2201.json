        "HLA antibodies are typically produced after exposure to transplanted tissue, pregnancy, and blood products. Sensitization delays access to transplantation and preclude utilization of donor organs. Infections and vaccinations have also been reported to result in HLA antibody formation. It is not known if patients develop HLA antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we analyzed a series of eighteen patients waiting for kidney transplantation who had symptomatic COVID-19 disease and recovered. None of the patients in this initial series developed de novo HLA antibodies. Notably, there was no increase in preexisting HLA antibodies in four highly sensitized patients with a CPRA\u00a0>\u00a080%. These preliminary data suggest that there may not be a need to repeat HLA antibody testing or perform a physical crossmatch on admission serum before kidney transplant for COVID-19 recovered patients. Data from a large number of patients with different demographics needed."
