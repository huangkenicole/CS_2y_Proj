        "SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged zoonotic virus, has resulted in unstoppable high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. However, due to\u00a0a limited knowledge of the dynamics of the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has been observed that the current\u00a0COVID-19 therapy has led to some clinical repercussions. We discuss the adverse effects of drugs for COVID-19 primarily based on some clinical trials. As therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of therapy may vary due to different, genetic determinants, sex, age and\u00a0the ethnic background of test subjects, hence biomarker-based personalized therapy could be more appropriate. We will share our thoughts on the current landscape of personalized therapy as a roadmap to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or another emerging pathogen."
