        "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to persist due to mutations resulting in newer, more infectious variants of concern. We aimed to leverage an ongoing private SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratory's infrastructure to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants in two large California counties. Study enrollment was offered to adults aged 18\u00a0years or older in Los Angeles County and Riverside County who recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A cycle threshold value less than or equal to 30 cycles was considered a positive test for sequencing purposes. Within 5\u00a0days of study enrollment, clinician-monitored, self-collected oral fluid and anterior nares swab specimens were obtained from participants. Specimens were transported and stored at 8\u00a0\u00b0C or cooler. Samples underwent ribonucleic acid extraction, library preparation, and sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 lineages were identified using sequencing data. Participant and genomic data were analyzed using statistical tools and visualized with toolkits. The study was approved by Advarra Institutional Review Board (Pro00053729). From May 27, 2021 to September 9, 2021, 503 individuals were enrolled and underwent specimen collection. Of the 503 participants, 238 (47.3%) participants were women, 329 (63.6%) participants were vaccinated, and 221 (43.9%) participants were of Hispanic or Spanish origin. Of the cohort, 496 (98.6%) participants had symptoms at the time of collection. Among the 503 samples, 443 (88.1%) nasal specimens and 353 (70.2%) oral specimens yielded positive sequencing results. Over our study period, the prevalence of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 decreased (initially 23.1% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0-0.49%] to 0% [95% CI 0.0-0.0%]) as the prevalence of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 increased (initially 33.3% [95% CI 0.0-100.0%] to 100.0% [95% CI 100.0-100.0%]). A strain that carried mutations of both Delta and Mu was identified. We found that outpatient SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance could be conducted in a timely and accurate manner. The prevalence of different variants changed over time. A higher proportion of nasal specimens yielded results versus oral specimens. Timely and regional outpatient SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance could be used for public health efforts to identify changes in SARS-CoV-2 strain epidemiology."
