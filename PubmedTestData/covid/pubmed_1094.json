      "AbstractText": [
        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and resulting COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic have required mass diagnostic testing, often taking place in testing sites within hospitals, clinics, or at satellite locations. To establish the potential of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission and to identify junctures during testing that result in increased viral exposure, aerosol and surface samples were examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from locations within Nebraska Medicine COVID-19 testing and vaccine clinics. Aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected within clinics suggest viral shedding from infected individuals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in aerosol samples was shown to correlate with clinic operation and patient infection, as well as with community infection findings. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in surface samples collected from clinics. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols in these clinics supports the continued use of respiratory protection and sanitization practices for healthcare workers, and other workers with public facing occupations."
