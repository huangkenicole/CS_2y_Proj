        "The aim of this study is to report a case series of three patients who developed postoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although the initial tests were negative.",
        "Between April and September 2020, three patients submitted to pancreatoduodenectomy developed SARS-CoV-2 infection; their outcomes were compared to those of a similar group in which the postoperative outcomes were uneventful.",
        "There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pre- and intraoperative outcomes; however, all of the three cases who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection postoperatively required re-admission in the intensive care unit and a longer hospital in stay. The overall mortality rate was null.",
        "Patients submitted to pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer who develop SARS-COV-2 infection postoperatively need a more appropriate supportive care; however, the overall mortality does not appear to increase, justifying, in this way, the continuation of programmed oncological of surgeries."
