        "Some viruses are known to be associated with increased apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death triggered by these viruses has a complex role in host antiviral immunity, and might facilitate the viral clearance or act as a mechanism for virus-induced tissue injury and disease progression. The induction of apoptosis is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is a direct relationship between apoptosis rate and COVID-19 pathogenicity/severity. Targeting virus-induced apoptosis could be a promising strategy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection."
