        "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the organisation of medical care.",
        "This is the first prospective observational study on patient-reported outcomes, quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction in patients with cancer with their care management in a day hospital during the period of May-June 2020. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Screener and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey were used.",
        "The survey was completed by 189 of 267 patients. They were generally aged 61 to 70 years and women and presented with lung, breast, or colorectal cancer. Patients had low anxiety scores (mean: 3.2\u00b14.5), with only 11.1% showing anxiety. Risk factors of anxiety included female gender (p=0.03) and lifestyle (residence, family environment) (p=0.01). The patient's physical health was stable, whereas mental health had deteriorated (p<0.0001). Risk factors of altered HRQOL included age and lifestyle. Patients greatly appreciated all the facilities of the day hospital and its organisation.",
        "This study shows a preserved HRQOL and low anxiety of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic."
