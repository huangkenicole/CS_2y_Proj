      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a serious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a global pandemic. Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 on the 25th January 2020. By March 2020, the virus had spread within Canadian communities reaching the most frail and vulnerable elderly population in long-term care facilities. The majority of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, and the highest mortality was seen among individuals aged 65 years or older. Canada has the highest prevalence and incidence rates of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease. Many elderly Canadians also live with comorbid medical illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease, and are more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that underlying inflammatory disease contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the host inflammatory responses that lead to resolution or progression to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss the landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics that are currently in development in Canada."
