        "Advancing frontiers of clinical research, we discuss the need for\u00a0intelligent health systems to support a\u00a0deeper investigation of COVID-19. We hypothesize that the\u00a0convergence of the healthcare data and staggering developments in artificial intelligence have\u00a0the potential to elevate the\u00a0recovery process with diagnostic and predictive analysis to identify major causes of mortality, modifiable risk factors and actionable information that supports the\u00a0early detection and prevention of COVID-19. However, current constraints include the\u00a0recruitment of COVID-19 patients for research; translational integration of electronic health records\u00a0and diversified public datasets; and the\u00a0development of artificial intelligence systems for data-intensive computational modeling to assist clinical decision making. We propose a novel nexus of machine learning algorithms to examine COVID-19 data granularity from population studies to subgroups stratification and ensure best modeling strategies within the data continuum."
