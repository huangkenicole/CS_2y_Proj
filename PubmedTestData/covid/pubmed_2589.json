        "Accurate and fast molecular testing is important for the diagnosis and control of COVID-19. During patient surges in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratories were challenged by a higher demand for molecular testing under skilled staff shortages. We developed an automated multipurpose molecular testing system, named PCRpack, for the rapid, high-throughput testing of infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. The system is provided in an all-in-one package, including a liquid handling instrument, a laboratory information management system, and other materials needed for testing operation; is highly customizable; and is easily implemented. PCRpack showed robust liquid handling performance, high clinical diagnostic performance, a shorter turn-around time with minimal hands-on time, and a high testing capacity. These features contribute to the rapid implementation of the high-performance and high-throughput molecular testing environment at any phase of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 or future emerging pathogens."
