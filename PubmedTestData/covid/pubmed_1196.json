        "Rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antigen tests can be used to aid in quickly identifying positive cases, which can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection. Using previously characterized Omicron-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), non-Omicron-positive SARS-CoV-2, and negative samples, we evaluated five brands of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests (On/Go at-home COVID-19 rapid antigen self-test, iHealth COVID-19 antigen rapid test, QuickVue SARS antigen test, Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 card home test, and InBios SCoV-2 Ag detect rapid self-test). Our results showed that these rapid tests had similar levels of sensitivity to Omicron and non-Omicron variants (On/Go, 76.4% and 71.0%; iHealth, 73.0% and 71.0%; QuickVue, 84.3% and 74.3%; BinaxNOW, 69.7% and 71.0%; and InBios, 66.3% and 64.5%, respectively). In conclusion, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests can continue to be used as part of public health measures to combat the spread of the Omicron variant, as their sensitivity was not significantly affected. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The emergence of the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to mutations as part of the virus evolution process. These mutations might affect the sensitivity of diagnostic tests that are currently being used to detect the virus. Because rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antigen tests are commonly used in the general population, it is important to assess their performance in detecting the Omicron variant. Here, we compared the performance of five brands of rapid tests against Omicron and non-Omicron variants using nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media. Our result found no difference in their performance, suggesting no reduction in sensitivity when used to detect the Omicron variant."
