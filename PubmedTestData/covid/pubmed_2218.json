        "COVID-19 could remain a pandemic until we get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to immunize the world population. In the interim, we have the opportunity to consider its clinicopathobiology in the context of the pharmacologic correlates available from the existing medical literature to prevent the COVID-19 infected patient from progressing into a fatal stage. This commentary serves as a forum for that end and suggests relatively non-toxic therapies that could be applied in a combinatorial fashion for consideration by the physicians and their patients with COVID-19 infection."
