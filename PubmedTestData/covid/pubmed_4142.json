        "In response to emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is critical to quickly identify and understand responsible pathogens, risk factors, host immune responses, and pathogenic mechanisms at both the molecular and cellular levels. The recent development of multiomic technologies, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomics, has enabled a fast and panoramic grasp of the pathogen and the disease. Here, we systematically reviewed the major advances in the virology, immunology, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been achieved via multiomic technologies. Based on well-established cohorts, omics-based methods can greatly enhance the mechanistic understanding of diseases, contributing to the development of new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19."
