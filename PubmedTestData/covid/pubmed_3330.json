      "AbstractText": [
        "The coronavirus is continuously mutating and creating new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Public awareness about SARS-CoV-2 mutation is essential for effective preventive measures. The present study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards SARS-CoV-2 variants among the general population in Bangladesh.",
        "We conducted this online survey between 9 April 2021 and 10 May 2021 using structured questionnaires to collect the information.",
        "We distributed the survey link among the participants from all 64 districts of Bangladesh using social media platforms.",
        "A total of 1,090 respondents completed this survey. After careful evaluation, we excluded 18 responses due to partial or incomplete information, and 1,072 responses entered into the final analysis.",
        "The KAP of participants towards SARS-CoV-2 variants depends on their demographic backgrounds. Associations between demographic characteristics and the likelihood of having adequate KAP were estimated using adjusted logistic regressions.",
        "Among the participants, 42% had a poor knowledge level, 4% had a low attitude level and 14% had a poor practice score. The average knowledge, attitude and practice score were 2.65, 4.194 and 4.464 on a scale of 5, respectively. Only 51.8% of the participants knew about mutant strains, and only 47.6% knew about the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants. The key factors associated with poor knowledge levels were educational levels, area of residence, geographic location, and concern regarding COVID-19. Sociodemographic factors for poor attitude levels were geographic location, vaccination and concern regarding COVID-19. The pivotal factors in determining poor practice scores were the residence area of people and concern regarding COVID-19.",
        "The knowledge level and positive attitude are associated with better preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on these findings, we recommended several awareness programmes on SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variants for the rural population in Bangladesh to increase overall awareness levels."
