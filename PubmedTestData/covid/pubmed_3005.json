      "AbstractText": [
        "There are limited data describing clinical patterns and match running performance (MRP) among players with COVID-19 infection before and after infection, particularly related to different predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as in comparison to uninfected players. This observational study was conducted during two consecutive soccer seasons in one professional club in Split, Croatia. There were four clusters of mild, self-limited, or asymptomatic infection characterised by low adherence to preventive measures. Infected players had significantly more symptoms (<i>t</i>-test = 3.24; <i>p</i> = 0.002), a longer period of physical inactivity (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 10.000; <i>p</i> = 0.006) and a longer period of self-assessment for achieving full fitness (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 6.744; <i>p</i> = 0.034) in the 2020-2021 season (Wuhan wild strain and Alpha variant) than in the 2021-2022 season (Omicron variant). It was also found that, despite the milder clinical presentation of the infection in the 2021-2022 season, the players had significantly more abnormal laboratory findings (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 9.069240; <i>p</i> = 0.002), although without clinical significance at the time of the study. As for the MRP, player performance in the 2021-2022 season was not negatively affected by the Omicron variant, while there was an improvement in MRP in scores for a sample of all players. The RTP protocol was correctly applied because it helped the athletes to recover their pre-infection physical capacities relatively quickly. This study advances the understanding that an optimally and individually planned RTP protocol is crucial for the MRP of infected players. Future research needs to replicate the findings of abnormal laboratory results and extend the study focusing on their potential long-term clinical significance."
