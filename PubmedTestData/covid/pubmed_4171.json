        "Identification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages has shown to provide invaluable information regarding treatment efficacy, viral transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasion. These benefits provide institutions with an expectation of high informational upside with little insight in regards to practicality with implementation and execution of such high complexity testing in the midst of a pandemic. This article details our institution's experience implementing and using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to monitor SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the northern Chicagoland area throughout the pandemic. To date, we have sequenced nearly 7,000 previously known SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from various patient populations (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, and outreach sites) to reduce bias in sampling. As a result, our hospital was guided while making crucial decisions about staffing, masking, and other infection control measures during the pandemic. While beneficial, establishing this NGS procedure was challenging, with countless considerations at every stage of assay development and validation. Reduced staffing prompted transition from a manual to automated high throughput workflow, requiring further validation, lab space, and instrumentation. Data management and IT security were additional considerations that delayed implementation and dictated our bioinformatic capabilities. Taken together, our experience highlights the obstacles and triumphs of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing."
