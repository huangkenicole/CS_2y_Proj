        "The study aimed to evaluate practice changes in the time period of the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "This was a retrospective single institution study. We defined palliative radiotherapy (PRT) initiated before Saturday, March 14<sup>th</sup> as pre-COVID and PRT initiated later as during-COVID (through June 30<sup>th</sup>).",
        "National COVID-19 recommendations led to a significant decrease in PRT with 10 or more fractions, while re-irradiation and radiotherapy during the final 30 days of life were equally common before and after these recommendations had been issued in March 2020.",
        "Rapid adoption of modified PRT regimens was feasible. However, the challenge of overtreatment in the final phase of the disease, due to inaccurate survival prediction, persisted."
