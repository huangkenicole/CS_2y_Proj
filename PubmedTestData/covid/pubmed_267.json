        "Anosmia, encephalopathy and stroke are the most common neurological syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, though many others have been reported. Analysis of human biopsy samples suggests that anosmia results predominantly from SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cells in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, leading to local inflammation and neuronal malfunction. A high proportion of patients admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19 develop delirium, and evidence suggests that this is caused by microvascular and inflammatory mechanisms. Autopsy data show activation of astrocytes and microglia in COVID-19, particularly in the brainstem, where there is also infiltration of cytotoxic T cells<sup>,</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the brain with PCR and immunohistochemistry, but the evidence to date suggests it is mostly in vascular and immune cells rather than directly infecting neurons<sup>,</sup>."
