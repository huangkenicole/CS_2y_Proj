      "AbstractText": [
        "The clinical symptoms caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are nonspecific and can be associated with most other respiratory viruses that cause acute respiratory tract infections (ARI). Because the clinical differentiation of COVID-19 patients from those with other respiratory viruses is difficult, the evaluation of automated methods to detect important respiratory viruses together with SARS-CoV-2 seems necessary. Therefore, this study compares two molecular assays for the detection of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2: the Respiratory Viruses 16-Well Assay (AusDiagnostics, Pty Ltd., Mascot, Australia) and the Allplex\u2122 RV Essential Assay coupled with the Allplex\u2122-nCoV Assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea). The two methods (AusDiagnostics and Alplex<sup>TM</sup>-nCoV Assay SARS-CoV-2) had 98.6% agreement with the reference method, cobas 6800, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between the AusDiagnostics assay and the Alplex<sup>TM</sup> RV Essential Assay for the detection of seven respiratory viruses was 99%. In our experience, the Respiratory Viruses 16-Well Assay proved to be the most valuable and useful medium-throughput method for simultaneous detection of important respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2. The main advantages of the method are high specificity for all targets included and their simultaneous detection and medium throughput with the option of having multiple instruments provide a constant run."
