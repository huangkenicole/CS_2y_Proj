      "AbstractText": [
        "<b>Introduction.</b> Starting in December, 2020, the ID NOW was implemented throughout the province of Alberta, Canada (population 4.4\u2009million) in various settings.<b>Gap statement.</b> ID NOW's test performance with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.1 is unknown.<b>Aim.</b> To assess the ID NOW performance among symptomatic individuals during the BA.1 Omicron wave and compare it to previous SARS-CoV-2 variant waves.<b>Methodology.</b> The ID NOW was assessed in two locations among symptomatic individuals: rural hospitals and community assessment centres (AC) during the period 5-18 January 2022. Starting 5 January, Omicron represented >95\u200a% of variants detected in our population. For every individual tested, two swabs were collected: one for ID NOW testing and the other for either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmation of negative ID NOW results or for variant testing of positive ID NOW results.<b>Results.</b> A total of 3041 paired samples were analysed (1139 RT-PCR positive). From this, 1873\u2009samples were from 42 COVID-19 AC and 1168 from 69 rural hospitals. ID NOW sensitivity for symptomatic individuals presenting to community AC and rural hospitals was 96.0\u200a% [95\u200a% confidence interval (CI) 94.5-97.3\u200a%, <i>n</i>=830 RT-PCR positive], and 91.6\u200a% (95\u200a% CI 87.9-94.4\u200a%, <i>n</i>=309 RT-PCR positive), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was very high for both populations (44.3\u200a% at AC, 26.5\u200a% in hospital).<b>Conclusions.</b> Sensitivity of ID NOW SARS-CoV-2, compared to RT-PCR, is very high during the BA.1 Omicron wave, and is significantly higher when compared to previous SARS-CoV-2 variant waves."
