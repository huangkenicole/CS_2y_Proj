      "AbstractText": [
        "Virus-cell interactions involve fundamental parameters that need to be considered in strategies implemented to control viral outbreaks. Among these, the surface electrostatic potential can give valuable information to deal with new epidemics. In this article, we describe the role of this key parameter in the hemagglutination of red blood cells and in the co-evolution of synaptic receptors and neurotransmitters. We then establish the functional link between lipid rafts and the electrostatic potential of viruses, with special emphasis on gangliosides, which are sialic-acid-containing, electronegatively charged plasma membrane components. We describe the common features of ganglioside binding domains, which include a wide variety of structures with little sequence homology but that possess key amino acids controlling ganglioside recognition. We analyze the role of the electrostatic potential in the transmission and intra-individual evolution of HIV-1 infections, including gatekeeper and co-receptor switch mechanisms. We show how to organize the epidemic surveillance of influenza viruses by focusing on mutations affecting the hemagglutinin surface potential. We demonstrate that the electrostatic surface potential, by modulating spike-ganglioside interactions, controls the hemagglutination properties of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) as well as the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We relate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of repositioned molecules to their ability to disrupt virus-raft interactions, challenging the old concept that an antibiotic or anti-parasitic cannot also be an antiviral. We propose a new concept based on the analysis of the electrostatic surface potential to develop, in real time, therapeutic and vaccine strategies adapted to each new viral epidemic."
