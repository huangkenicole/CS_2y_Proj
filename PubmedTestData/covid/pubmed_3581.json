        "Accurate and timely diagnosis for COVID-19 diagnosis allows highly effective antiviral medications to be prescribed. The DASH\u2122 Rapid PCR System is a sample-to-answer point-of-care platform combining state-of-the-art PCR kinetics with sequence specific hybridization. The platform's first assay, the DASH\u2122 SARS-CoV-2/S test for anterior nares direct swab specimens, received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in March 2022 for point-of-care use. Here we report the analytical characteristics of the assay including limit of detection, dynamic range, and robustness of SARS-CoV-2 variant detection. The limit of detection was determined by testing swabs contrived with one hundred copies of wild type or Omicron BA.5 virus and detecting 20/20 and 19/20, respectively. The dynamic range was assessed with contrived swabs containing 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> copies; the log-linear relationship between Cq and copy input was plotted, and the qPCR efficiency calculated from the slope of the line was 101.4%. Detection of seven SARS-CoV-2 variants was demonstrated."
