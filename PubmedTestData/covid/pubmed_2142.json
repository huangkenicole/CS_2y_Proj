        "Independent assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (COV2Ag) tests remains important as varying performance between assays is common. We assessed the performance of a new high-throughput COV2Ag test compared to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT).",
        "A total of 347 nasopharyngeal samples collected from January to October 2021 were assessed by NAAT as part of standard-of-care testing (CDC LDT or GeneXpert System, Cepheid) and COV2Ag using the ADVIA Centaur CoV2Ag assay (Siemens Healthineers).",
        "Among NAAT positive specimens we found 82.4% agreement and in NAAT negative specimens we found 97.3% agreement (overall agreement 85.6%). In symptomatic persons, COV2Ag agreed with NAAT 90.0% (n\u2005=\u2005291), and in asymptomatic persons, 62.5% (n\u2005=\u200556). Agreement between positive NAAT and COV2Ag increased at lower cycle threshold (Ct) values.",
        "The COV2Ag assay exceeded the World Health Organization minimum performance requirements of\u2005\u2265\u200580% sensitivity and\u2005\u2265\u200597% specificity. The COV2Ag assay is helpful for large scale screening efforts due to high-throughput and reduced wait times."
