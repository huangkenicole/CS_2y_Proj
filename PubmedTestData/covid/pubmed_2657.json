        "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been a few variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), one of which is the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). The Omicron variant is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant, and its high transmissibility and immune evasion ability have raised global concerns. Owing to its enhanced transmissibility, Omicron has rapidly replaced Delta as the dominant variant in several regions. However, recent studies have shown that the Omicron variant exhibits reduced pathogenicity due to altered cell tropism. In addition, Omicron exhibits significant resistance to the neutralizing activity of vaccines, convalescent serum, and most antibody therapies. In the present review, recent advances in the molecular and clinical characteristics of the infectivity, pathogenicity, and immune evasion of Omicron variant was summarized, and potential therapeutic applications in response to Omicron infection were discussed. Furthermore, we highlighted potential response to future waves and strategies to end the pandemic."
