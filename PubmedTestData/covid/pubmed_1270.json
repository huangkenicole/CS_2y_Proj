        "Coronaviruses are a group of known RNA virus which primarily infect the respiratory tract, and also neurological, enteric, and hepatic systems. Endemic outbreaks of Middle East Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been observed in recent decades. A new strain named the SARS CoV-2(- COVID-19) virus has now spread across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable and has culminated in a massive pandemic of COVID-19. Currently, no successful treatment is available. Therefore, an urgent need is there for new screening models that can aid in identifying the drugs with potential activity against COVID-19. The current review aims to discuss various in-silico, in- -vitro and in-vivo screening methods that can potentially be used to expedite the discovery of new active therapeutic candidates and vaccines, drug targets, and repurposing the commercially available drugs against COVID-19 for the effective management of the infection and thereby controlling this pandemic. Further, the current status of drugs and vaccines under clinical investigation has been summarized."
