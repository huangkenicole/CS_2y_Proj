        "We report an outbreak investigation to map intra-hospital transmission among health care workers (HCW) using epidemiological and whole-genome sequencing data.",
        "Fourteen clinical wards (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) with high infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 among HCW were selected and demographical, epidemiological and sequencing data were collected of all HCW testing positive by RT-PCR. Clustered cases were identified based on first disease onsets and differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) and were analysed for additional characteristics.",
        "Data was collected for 123 HCW. Out of 123 HCW, 65 (53%) worked at eight non-COVID-19 wards, 56 (46%) at four COVID-19 wards, one (<1%) worked on several wards and for one (<1%) it was unknown. One major cluster (n = 34) and three minor clusters (n = 2,3,4; total n = 9) comprising of 43 HCW (35%) were found after comparing our study population (n = 123) with the circulating regional sequences (n = 819). In clustered cases work was most often the suspected source of infection and continuing work while having symptoms occurred in all clusters, ranging from 1-6 days.",
        "Our findings strongly indicate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among HCW. Whole-genome sequencing is useful for identification of clusters and can give direction to targeted infection prevention measures."
