        "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global public health emergency, and the disease it causes is highly variable in its clinical presentation. Host genetic factors are increasingly recognised as a determinant of infection susceptibility and disease severity. Several initiatives and groups have been established to analyse and review host genetic epidemiology associated with COVID-19 outcomes. Here, we review the genetic loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity focusing on the common variants identified in genome-wide association studies."
