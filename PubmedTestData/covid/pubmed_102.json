        "In December 2019, the emergence and expansion of novel and infectious respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 originated from Wuhan, China caused an unprecedented threat to the public health and became a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive sense and single stranded RNA virus belonging to genera betacoronavirus, of Coronaviridae family. The viral genome sequencing studies revealed 75-80% similarity with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the lower respiratory system and may progress to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Apart from life-threatening situations and burden on the global healthcare system, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed several challenges on the worldwide economics and livelihood. The novel pathogen is highly virulent, rapidly mutating and has a tendency to cross the species boundaries such as from bats to humans through the evolution and natural selection from intermediate host. In this review we tried to summarize the overall picture of SARS-CoV-2 including origin/ emergence, epidemiology, pathogenesis, genome organization, comparative analysis with other CoVs, infection and replication mechanism along with cellular tropism and immunopathogenesis which will provide a brief panoramic view about the virus and disease."
