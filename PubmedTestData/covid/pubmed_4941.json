        "The purpose of the study is to analyze patterns demonstrated by the COVID-19 epidemic process in a megacity\u00a0during the increase, stabilization and reduction in the incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic\u00a0prevention measures.",
        "The comprehensive study incorporating epidemiological, molecular genetic and\u00a0 statistical research methods was conducted to analyze the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Moscow during the COVID- 19\u00a0pandemic.",
        "It was found that the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases was prevented due to the\u00a0most stringent control and restrictive measures deployed in Moscow to break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and due to people who were very disciplined in complying with the self-isolation rules. The\u00a0 analysis of\u00a0the dynamics in detection of new COVID-19 cases showed that in a megacity, the impact of social distancing and\u00a0self-isolation would become apparent only after 3.5 incubation periods, where the maximum length of the period\u00a0is 14 days. It was discovered that the detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in relatively healthy population\u00a0and its dynamics are important monitoring parameters, especially during the increase and stabilization in the\u00a0COVID-19 incidence, and are instrumental in predicting the development of the epidemic situation within a range\u00a0of 1-2 incubation periods (14-28 days). In Moscow, the case fatality rate was 1.73% over the observation period\u00a0(6/3/2020-23/6/2020).",
        "The epidemiological analysis of the COVID-19 situation in Moscow showed certain patterns of the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 spread and helped evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures aimed at\u00a0 breaking the routes of transmission of the pathogen."
