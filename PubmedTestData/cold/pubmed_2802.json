        "Recent studies suggest that a number of common cold medicines, including nasal decongestants are not suitable for small children. In Latvia nasal decongestants are primarily over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and patient information leaflets generally permit use of these medicines for small children. The previous studies in Latvia investigating the use of medicines in cases of common cold demonstrated extensive use of decongestants in children less than six years of age, marking a necessity for more profound research. As a result a qualitative study was implemented in 2011 to identify sources of information that offer advice for the use of decongestants in children. The caregivers' perception of risks, trust, and the role of emotions associated with use of these medicines was considered. The study results suggested that emotions have a considerable effect on the decisions of caregivers. Even though caregivers are aware of the risks associated with the use of decongestants, they still frequently administer these medicines for the sake of the comfort of both the child and the caregiver. It is essential to raise a discussion about the inappropriate use of common cold medications in small children in Latvia."
