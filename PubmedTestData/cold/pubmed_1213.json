        "This review summarizes recent developments in the supportive treatment of common cold symptoms in children.",
        "Conventional common cold therapies are no longer recommended for use in young children because of safety concerns. There are no studies that convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of any therapy for treatment of common cold symptoms in children less than 6 years of age and it is unlikely studies that establish efficacy can be done. Recent studies report a significant effect of probiotics on the occurrence of common cold illnesses in children, and studies in animals provide a plausible mechanism of action. These data suggest that the use of probiotics may have promise for the prevention of common cold illnesses in children.",
        "The effect of treatment on the severity of common cold symptoms cannot be accurately assessed with current study designs. In the absence of convincing evidence of efficacy, treatment of young children with symptomatic therapies cannot be recommended. Preliminary data suggest a small, beneficial effect of probiotics for the prevention of common cold illness."
