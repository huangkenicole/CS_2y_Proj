        "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first described in 1960s for patients experiencing common cold. Since then, increasing number of HCoVs have been discovered, including those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the circulating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can cause fatal respiratory disease in humans on infection. HCoVs are believed to spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with HCoV infection develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and many patients with confirmed HCoV infection have shown detectable viral RNA in their faecal samples. Furthermore, multiple in vitro and in vivo animal studies have provided direct evidence of intestinal HCoV infection. These data highlight the nature of HCoV GI infection and its potential faecal-oral transmission. Here, we summarise the current findings on GI manifestations of HCoVs. We also discuss how HCoV GI infection might occur and the current evidence to establish the occurrence of faecal-oral transmission."
