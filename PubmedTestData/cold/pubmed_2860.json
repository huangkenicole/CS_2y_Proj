        "The purpose of the study was to evaluate an Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) cold/flu self-care public education campaign to reduce unnecessary patient visits to doctors. The MOH campaign consisted of an information booklet delivered to every household in an Ontario city, newspaper ads and radio spots. The program ran during January-March 1994. The evaluation consisted of: (1) 2x2 telephone survey in London (experimental area) and Windsor (comparison area), before and during the campaign; and (2) a telephone survey of London family practitioners during the campaign. In addition, data on the incidence of cold/flu visits to three hospital emergency departments and a sample of family physicians' offices were gathered. The data suggest that program rationale may have been questionable because the majority of the surveyed public were knowledgeable and self-reported appropriate doctor visits for cold/flu. Campaign evaluation showed limited impact. Message penetration was low; only one-third of London residents knew of the campaign or read the booklet. Only two of 10 questions showed increases in knowledge in London and no changes were found for beliefs, attitudes, acquisition of new health practices or self-reported visits to the doctor. The physician survey, emergency room and family physician office visit data were consistent with the public survey findings."
