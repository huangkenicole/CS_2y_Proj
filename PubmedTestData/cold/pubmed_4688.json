        "Low temperatures limit the geographic distribution and yield of plants. Hormones play an important role in coordinating the growth and development of plants and their tolerance to low temperatures. However, the mechanisms by which hormones affect plant resistance to extreme cold stress in the natural environment are still unclear. In this study, two winter wheat varieties with different cold resistances, Dn1 and J22, were used to conduct targeted plant hormone metabolome analysis on the tillering nodes of winter wheat at 5\u2009\u00b0C, -10\u2009\u00b0C and -25\u2009\u00b0C using an LC-ESI-MS/MS system. We screened 39 hormones from 88 plant hormone metabolites and constructed a partial regulatory network of auxin, jasmonic acid and cytokinin. GO analysis and enrichment of KEGG pathways in different metabolites showed that the 'plant hormone signal transduction' pathway was the most common. Our study showed that extreme low temperature increased the most levels of auxin, cytokinin and salicylic acid, and decreased levels of jasmonic acid and abscisic acid, and that levels of auxin, jasmonic acid and cytokinin in Dn1 were higher than those in J22. These changes in hormone levels were associated with changes in gene expression in synthesis, catabolism, transport and signal transduction pathways. These results differ from the previous hormone regulation mechanisms, which were mostly obtained at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Our results provide a basis for further understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plant endogenous hormones regulate plant freezing stress tolerance."
