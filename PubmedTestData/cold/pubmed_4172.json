        "To study the pharmacologic characteristics in synergism and complementation of 999 Ganmaoling (GML), a compound recipe composed of Chinese and Western materia medica (CMM & WMM), as well as its theoretical basis of matching of Chinese and Western materia medica.",
        "The torsion response induced by glacial acetic acid in mice, toe swelling induced by carrageenanin rats, delayed hypersensitive response in mice and fever induced by endotoxin in rats and rabbits were used to comparatively study the actions of CMM & WMM in GML. The effect of CMM in antagonizing liver damage caused by WD (acetaminophen) in mice was also studied. RT-PCR method was used to analyze the expression of related cytokines.",
        "GML showed a significant antipyretic and analgesic effect, it could inhibit the carrageenan induced inflammation, antagonize the endotoxin induced fever, and promote the amount for expression of cytokines in rats' splenic tissue with pneumococci infection to some extent. The CMM in GML showed certain protective effect on acetaminophen induced liver damage.",
        "GML has a potent antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, CMM & WMM in GML showed markedly synergism and complementation, and CMM in it has liver protective effect."
