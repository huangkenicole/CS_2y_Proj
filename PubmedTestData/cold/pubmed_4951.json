        "Susceptibility of Escherichia coli to cold-shock, osmotic-shock and cold-osmotic-shock has been evaluated throughout the cellular division cycle for a variety of generation time. Two periods of sensitisation were detected. The first of these was towards cold-shock which occurred 60 min prior to cell division and might correspond to initiation of DNA replication. The second period of sensitisation was towards both cold-, osmotic- and cold-osmotic-shock and occurred immediately prior to and during cell division. Patterns and extents of sensitisation towards each of these three stresses during the second period were suggestive of a common sensitising event associated with constriction of the cell and separation."
