        "This study was conducted to determine the number and composition of the various cough and cold formulations available in the Indian market and to study their pharmacological rationale over a period of 7years. Data for the study was collected from an annual Drug Compendium entitled 'THE DRUG TODAY' of the years 2001, 2004, and 2007. Medications were assessed for total number, different formulations, and number of constituents present in each formulation, their pharmacological group and amount of each constituent per dose. Rationality of available preparations was assessed on a seven-point scoring criteria. There are over thirteen hundred drug products for cough and cold in the Indian market, which is an increase of 71.2% from the year 2001. More than 90% of the preparations were fixed-dose combinations (FDCs). Majority of the cough and cold preparations had 3-4 constituents. Many preparations contained more than one constituent of the same pharmacological group. Some preparations had constituents with opposing action. A wide variation in the amount of each constituent present per dose in different formulations was observed. The number of banned drug combinations for cough and cold showed an increase from 9 in 2001 to 27 in 2007. Rationality assessment of the FDC preparations revealed that most of the preparations were irrational and had no documented benefit in the treatment of common cold. Availability of such a large number of irrational FDCs for cough and cold requires serious review of the legal provisions in India for drug manufacturing and marketing."
