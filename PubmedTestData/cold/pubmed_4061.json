        "The rapidly changing global conditions of the environment and climate have resulted in higher requirements for urban design. Significant annual temperature variations and large day/night temperature differences in cold-region cities leads to high energy consumption. Therefore, it is challenging to achieve low energy consumption in cold-region cities. Urban morphology focuses on the physical elements of urban areas, reflecting the relationship between the city and its environment and the city's response to natural climatic conditions. Building clusters are common in cold regions due to the extreme climate. Thus, it is crucial to study the energy performance of cities by considering urban morphology. This study focuses on four morphological patterns of building clusters: point, linear, courtyard, and mixed patterns. A case study is conducted in Harbin, a cold-region city in China. Samples of the four morphological patterns are extracted, and GIS analysis and manual labeling are used to analyze the dominant morphological patterns of building clusters in cold regions. Average nearest-neighbor analysis is used to obtain quantitative results and determine the prevalence of different morphological patterns of building clusters in cold regions. This process can be used to determine the dominant patterns of urban building clusters and provide a scientific basis for selecting the morphological patterns of new building clusters in cold regions."
