      "AbstractText": [
        "Specimens of nasal mucus were collected from 17 volunteers experimentally infected with rhinovirus and from 10 uninfected control subjects. Ciliated epithelial cells (CECs) were found in the nasal mucus of 16 of the infected volunteers but of none of the control subjects. The CECs were shown to contain rhinovirus antigen by indirect immunoperoxidase and fluorescent antibody staining. The pattern of CEC shedding was similar to the mean nasal symptom score pattern of the volunteers. However, the amount of CED shedding for an individual was not correlated with the severity of the symptoms. This finding suggests that the symptoms of a rhinovirus cold may be produced in part by processes that are independent of the severity of direct virus-induced damage to the epithelium."
