        "Acute respiratory infections are the second leading cause of morbidity in children under 18 years. Several drugs have been used with variable efficacy and safety, trying to reduce the associated symptoms and improve quality of life.",
        "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of buphenine, aminophenazone and diphenylpyraline hydrochloride when compared with placebo for the control of symptoms associated with common cold in children 6-24 months of age.",
        "Randomized clinical trial, double blind, placebo controlled, in 100 children < 24 months of any gender, with symptoms associated to common cold. They received the drug under study vs. placebo for seven days. Both groups received acetaminophen. The change on common cold related symptoms were evaluated. Statistic analysis was made with STATA 11.0 for Mac.",
        "Fifty-three children were randomized to study drug and forty-seven to placebo. Age of children in each group was similar (12.2 +/- 5.8 months vs. 12.7 +/- 5.8 months, p NS). There were significant differences between groups in relation to rhinorrea and sneezing resolution, with better results in Flumil group and no adverse events observed.",
        "The results in this study indicates that Flumil is a safe and effective drug for control of symptoms present in the common cold in children aged 6-24 months."
