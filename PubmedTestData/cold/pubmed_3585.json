        "Ipratropium bromide (IB) has been found to reduce secretions in the upper respiratory tract; this is accomplished through competitive inhibition of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors that control rhinorrhea production. This study compared the safety and efficacy of IB with placebo in the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea in patients with the common cold. Human subjects with symptoms of a common cold, primarily rhinorrhea, were enrolled and treated with either IB (84 micrograms/nostril) or placebo; each was administered as two sprays per nostril, four times a day, for 4 days. Primary efficacy analyses were in-clinic measurements of nasal discharge weights over a 3-hour period after administration on days 1 and 2 and assessment of rhinorrhea symptoms by use of a subjective patient-completed visual analog rating scale. IB significantly reduced rhinorrhea an average of 18% over placebo for days 1 and 2 (p = 0.01). Visual analog scale scores showed an average improvement in rhinorrhea of 22% over placebo (p = 0.001). When patients with relatively minor rhinorrhea (baseline weight of nasal discharge < or = 1.0 gm) were excluded, IB produced an average reduction in nasal discharge of 23% over placebo for days 1 and 2 (p = 0.003)."
