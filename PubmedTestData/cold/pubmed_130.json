        "Rhinovirus is the major cause of common cold and frequently associates with acute wheezing, otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. High prevalence of rhinovirus in hospitalized children and adults has been documented recently. We screened children > or =1 month of age, hospitalized for any infection, for the presence of rhinoviruses and recruited 24 families with > or =2 children for a 3-week follow-up study. Rhinovirus was detected in 46 (28%) of 163 hospitalizations by study children. Most rhinovirus-positive children (85%) had respiratory symptoms. During the follow-up, rhinoviruses were detected in virtually all children and in one-half of adults in families with a rhinovirus-positive index child, but commonly also in families with a rhinovirus-negative index child. Melting temperature and sequence analysis revealed the transmission routes of the viruses and showed that several virus types could circulate in the families simultaneously. Our studies corroborate the major contribution of rhinovirus to hospitalization of children, most often because of wheezing. Young children with respiratory symptoms are major spreaders of rhinovirus in family setting."
