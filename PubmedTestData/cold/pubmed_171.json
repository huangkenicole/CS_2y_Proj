        "Attempts to relieve the misery of the common cold have been made since long before current understanding of its viral origin. Although current symptomatic therapies provide some relief, any effective treatment must incorporate an antiviral to address the infection. Symptom production is related not only to viral cytopathic effect but also to the early activation of several inflammatory pathways. Antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. Combining an antiviral with selected therapeutic agents that block these inflammatory pathways has been shown to improve the effectiveness of cold treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment combined with regular dosing until symptoms subside appears to be the most effective treatment strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes. This strategy reduces viral shedding in nasal fluid, provides treatment for the period of maximum symptom burden, and may reduce the frequency and severity of the sinus disease that accompanies colds."
