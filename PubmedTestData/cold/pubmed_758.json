        "To profile medication dosing behaviour of caregivers of children aged 5 years and under in fever and cough/cold management.",
        "Caregivers (n\u2009=\u200997), recruited from childcare centres in Sydney, Australia, were presented two scenarios in a face to face consultation with the researcher, requiring them to make decisions about the management of a child, including medicine dosing. Accuracy of doses and appropriateness of management were documented. Focus groups explored factors surrounding caregivers' skills.",
        "In the fever scenario, 45% (44/97) chose to medicate when temperature was below 38\u00b0C. Many measured incorrect doses and stated inappropriate dosage intervals. Only 23% managed the scenario appropriately. In the cough/cold scenario, 43% (38/89) chose to medicate. Overall, only 35% (45/127) of dose measurements observed were accurate based on the child's weight. Focus groups revealed that caregivers are not aware of risks associated with children's medicines and when to medicate.",
        "The ability of caregivers to accurately measure and administer doses is important. Determining the motivations to use medicines, as well as dosing behaviours is necessary to improve the quality use of medicines."
