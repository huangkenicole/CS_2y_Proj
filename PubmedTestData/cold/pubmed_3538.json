      "AbstractText": [
        "This study investigated whether <i>Lactobacillus paragasseri</i> SBT2055 (LG2055) activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and suppresses common cold symptoms in healthy adults. Cell-based experiments showed that a LG2055 treatment upregulated CD86 and HLA-DR expression in pDCs, indicating that LG2055 activates pDCs in vitro. In a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative trial, 200 participants were randomly divided into two groups and consumed three capsules with or without LG2055 once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the score on a daily physical health questionnaire survey of common cold symptoms. Three participants discontinued the trial and six participants were excluded from the analysis, thus 191 participants (95 in the LG2055 group and 96 in the placebo group) were analyzed. The LG2055 group showed a significantly higher ratio of \"without symptoms\" responses for runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, hoarseness, and chill than the placebo group. Furthermore, a stratified analysis revealed that LG2055 intake enhanced CD86 and HLA-DR expression in the pDCs of the participants with low secretion rates of salivary secretory immunoglobulin A. These data suggest that LG2055 suppresses the subjective symptoms of the common cold by activating pDCs and improving the host's immune system in healthy adults, especially in immune-weakened individuals (UMIN000049183)."
