      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Avibacterium paragallinarum</i> is the causative agent of infectious coryza, a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. Given its fastidious nature, this bacterium is difficult to recover and identify, particularly from locations colonized by normal bacterial flora. Standard PCR methods have been utilized for detection but are labor-intensive and not feasible for high-throughput testing. We evaluated a real-time PCR (rtPCR) method targeting the HPG-2 region of <i>A. paragallinarum</i>, and validated a high-throughput extraction for this assay. Using single-tube extraction, the rtPCR detected 4 <i>A. paragallinarum</i> (ATCC 29545<sup>T</sup> and 3 clinical) isolates with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10\u2009cfu/mL and a PCR efficiency of 89-111%. Cross-reaction was not detected with 33 non-<i>A. paragallinarum</i>, all close relatives from the family <i>Pasteurellaceae</i>. Real-time PCR testing on extracts of 66 clinical samples (choana, sinus, or trachea) yielded 98.2% (35 of 36 on positives, 30 of 30 on negatives) agreement with conventional PCR. Duplicate samples tested in a 96-well format extraction in parallel with the single-tube method produced equivalent LOD on all <i>A. paragallinarum</i> isolates, and 96.8% agreement on 93 additional clinical samples extracted with both procedures. This <i>A. paragallinarum</i> rtPCR can be utilized for outbreak investigations and routine monitoring of susceptible flocks."
