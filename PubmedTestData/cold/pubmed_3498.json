        "The causal association between otitis media and viral upper respiratory tract infections (URI) suggests that early intervention during the course of a viral URI could prevent many episodes of otitis media. However, the feasibility of this approach can not be assessed at present since many aspects of the epidemiology and natural history of URI-associated otitis media are undefined. To address this deficiency, daily monitoring of middle ear status (tympanometry) and cold symptoms and weekly pneumatic otoscopy were done on a pilot cohort of 20 children. These children, between the ages of 2 and 6, were followed from November 1996 to April 1997. Compliance with symptom diaries was 85%, with tympanograms was 90%, and with weekly physician visits was 70%. During the study period, there were 53 'colds' (average 2.65 per child) and 28 new episodes of middle ear effusion (10 unilateral and 9 bilateral). Overall, 47.3% of the tympanograms were Type A, 17.2% Type C1, 9.4% Type C2, and 21.8% Type B. Children who developed MEE during the study spent more time with abnormal MEP (either MEP < -150 or flat) during both cold and healthy days than children who did not develop MEE. Temporally, during colds, high negative pressures preceded the development of Type B tympanograms in children who developed middle ear effusions. Children who did not develop effusions still had high negative pressures during colds, but recovered to a normal pressure within days. These observations document the feasibility of this investigational format for study of the sequential changes in middle ear status before, during and after a URI."
