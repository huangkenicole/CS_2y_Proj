        "Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a condition involving anemia and its related symptoms; it is caused by autoantibodies that bind and agglutinate red blood cells in areas susceptible to hypothermia, such as extremities exposed to cold temperatures. CAD is rare, with 5 to 20 human cases per million individuals. In this report, we describe a case of CAD in a previously healthy and experimentally na\u00efve adult Indian rhesus macaque that was housed indoors and presented with blood in the urine. After our observations of hemoglobinuria and anemia led us to suspect CAD, we demonstrated that the macaque's blood agglutinated at reduced temperatures. We also noticed that the provision of cold foraging treats triggered episodes of hemoglobinuria. Further investigation revealed that serum from the macaque agglutinated RBCs in vitro with high thermal amplitude (at or below 30 \u00b0C) and had an antibody titer of 8 to 32. The serum contained autoantibodies of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype; agglutinins of the IgG isotype were not detected. The cold-dependent IgM autoantibodies in the serum from the affected macaque reacted against a common RBC antigen because RBCs collected from other macaques were bound and agglutinated by the affected animal's IgM under cold conditions. This in vitro binding activity was reversible when the test temperature was returned to normal body temperature (37 \u00b0C). These findings demonstrated cold-dependent RBC-specific IgM agglutinins and led us to a diagnosis of CAD. This is the first documented case of spontaneous CAD in a rhesus macaque."
