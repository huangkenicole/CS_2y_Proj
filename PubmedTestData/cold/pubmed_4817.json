      "AbstractText": [
        "Nasal glucagon (NG) is a nasally-administered glucagon powder, absorbed through the nasal mucosa, designed for treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of NG in otherwise healthy participants with common colds and after recovery from cold symptoms, with and without concomitant nasal decongestant.",
        "This was a single-centre, open-label study. Cohort 1 participants (N\u2009=\u200918) received 2 doses of NG: one while experiencing nasal congestion and another after recovery from cold symptoms. Cohort 2 participants (N\u2009=\u200918), who also had colds with nasal congestion, received a single dose of NG 2\u2009hours after treatment with the decongestant oxymetazoline. Total symptoms score and other safety measures were assessed before and after NG administration.",
        "NG was well tolerated, without serious adverse events. Common adverse events (transient lacrimation, nasal discomfort, rhinorrhea and nausea) were more frequent in both Cohorts 1 and 2 during nasal congestion. Glucagon levels peaked 18\u2009minutes post-dose and glucose levels peaked 30 to 42\u2009minutes post-dose in all groups. Nasal congestion, with or without concomitant nasal decongestant, did not significantly affect PK of NG. Although glucose AUECs<sub>0-t</sub> was different between Cohort 1 with nasal congestion and Cohort 2, glucose concentrations at 30\u2009minutes appeared similar in all groups.",
        "There were no clinically relevant differences in safety or PK/PD of NG associated with nasal congestion or concomitant administration of nasal decongestant, suggesting that NG can be used to treat severe hypoglycaemia in individuals experiencing nasal congestion."
