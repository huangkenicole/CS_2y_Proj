        "Obese patients are known to have more chronic medical conditions.",
        "To compare the frequency of encounter for episodes of the 10 most common illnesses in general practice between obese and non-overweight patients.",
        "Data were derived from the Continuous Morbidity Registration, containing data from four general practices in and around Nijmegen (The Netherlands). In this research and registration network, a matched cohort study was performed. Each obese patient (body mass index > or = 30 kg/m(2)), aged 20-75 years, was matched for age, gender, socio-economic status and general practice, to approximately two patients without the diagnosis 'overweight' or 'obesity'. Over a period of 5 years (January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004), the frequency of encounter for episodes of the 10 most common illnesses was compared, taking chronic medical conditions into account.",
        "At the start, 550 patients with obesity could be identified and were matched to 954 controls. Obese patients presented more common illnesses than non-overweight patients (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.47), in particular common cold (without fever), myalgia of the upper girdle, dermatophytosis and bruise (contusion, haematoma).",
        "Obese patients present more common illnesses to their GP, such as common cold (without fever), myalgia of the upper girdle, dermatophytosis and bruise (contusion, haematoma). This is in addition to their higher co-morbidity of chronic medical conditions."
