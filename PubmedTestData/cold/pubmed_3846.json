        "To determine the prevalence of cold-related symptoms among the general population, especially people with pre-existing diseases.",
        "Six thousand nine hundred and fifty-one men and women aged 25-74 years, who had participated in the National FINRISK 2002 Study, filled in a questionnaire on cold-related symptoms.",
        "Age-specific and age-adjusted prevalence figures for cold-related symptoms were calculated. The symptoms were regressed for gender, age, region of residence, industry, self-reported disease and smoking.",
        "Five percent of the subjects reported chest pain or arrhythmia in the cold, and higher prevalence figures were found for respiratory (men 26%/women 31%) and musculoskeletal symptoms (31%/28%). The prevalence of cold-related cardiovascular symptoms was particularly high among subjects with coronary heart disease (33%/46%) or cardiac insufficiency (25%/40%), as was the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among asthmatics (69%/78%) and subjects with chronic bronchitis (66%/77%). The symptoms increased with age, were more common in colder areas than milder areas, and were more common in those engaged in agricultural work than those engaged in industry or services. Cold-related cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms were more common among women than men. The regression-adjusted contributions (percentage points) to various cold-related symptoms were 2-45% for lung disease, 7-9% for cardiovascular disease, 3-15% for joint or back disease and 6-13% for mental disease.",
        "Large proportions of people living in the north, particularly those with pre-existing medical conditions, experience cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal symptoms in the cold. Since the symptoms may predict future morbidity and mortality, a strategy is needed to reduce the cold-related health risks of the entire population."
