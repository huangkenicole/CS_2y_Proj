        "This registry study aimed to evaluate the use of Pycnogenol\u00ae (pine bark extract), an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-edema natural compound, on symptoms of common cold. Main targets were the evaluation in otherwise healthy subjects of signs/symptoms, the reduction in days of disease, and the prevention of complications.",
        "All subjects used the \"best management\" for colds and one group added Pycnogenol\u00ae capsules (50 mg, bid/die) from day zero. The resulting registry groups were comparable. A total of 70 subjects used Pycnogenol\u00ae and 76 acted as controls.",
        "The number of days with a perceived cold affecting the patients was reduced in the supplement group (3.1;0.4 days) in comparison with controls (4.2;0.2). Lost working days were significantly decreased in the supplement group (0.55;0.3 versus 0.67;0.3 in controls). The need to use any other compound (on demand basis; OTC products) to manage symptoms and the occurrence of any clinically significant complications were significantly lower in the Pycnogenol\u00ae group. The most frequent complications were the extension of the cold to a period longer than 4 days, a tracheal extension and a bronchial involvement. Pycnogenol\u00ae was significantly effective in reducing the number of complications. The daily evolution of the \"pillar cold signs\" indicates a significantly faster resolution in the supplement group. With supplementation the decrease in symptom scores appears to be significantly more important. Pycnogenol\u00ae supplementation appears to make regression faster for all symptoms in comparison with controls.",
        "In this pilot registry, Pycnogenol\u00ae appears to decrease symptoms of cold and shorten its course also preventing some complications."
