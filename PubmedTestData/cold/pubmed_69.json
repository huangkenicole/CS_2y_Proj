      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Anthurium andraeanum</i> is a tropical ornamental flower. The cost of <i>Anthurium</i> production is higher under low temperature (non-freezing) conditions; therefore, it is important to increase its cold tolerance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of <i>Anthurium</i> to cold stress remain elusive. In this study, comparative physiological and transcriptome sequencing analyses of two cultivars with contrasting cold tolerances were conducted to evaluate the cold stress response at the flowering stage. The activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase and the contents of proline, soluble sugar, and malondialdehyde increased under cold stress in the leaves of the cold tolerant cultivar Elegang (E) and cold susceptible cultivar Menghuang (MH), while the soluble protein content decreased in MH and increased in E. Using RNA sequencing, 24,695 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from comparisons between cultivars under the same conditions or between the treatment and control groups of a single cultivar, 9132 of which were common cold-responsive DEGs. Heat-shock proteins and pectinesterases were upregulated in E and downregulated in MH, indicating that these proteins are essential for <i>Anthurium</i> cold tolerance. Furthermore, four modules related to cold treatment were obtained by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The expression of the top 20 hub genes in these modules was induced by cold stress in E or MH, suggesting they might be crucial contributors to cold tolerance. DEGs were significantly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction pathways, trehalose metabolism, and ribosomal proteins, suggesting these processes play important roles in <i>Anthurium</i>'s cold stress response. This study provides a basis for elucidating the mechanism of cold tolerance in <i>A. andraeanum</i> and potential targets for molecular breeding."
