        "143 pharmacists returned a completed questionnaire by fax. Pharmacists currently recommend products for head colds for children aged 2 years to younger than 6 years more often than antitussives for coughs. More pharmacists were dissatisfied with the new ruling compared with those who were satisfied, with a main concern being that it went too far. Respondents indicated that when the new labels are implemented, they would be more likely to recommend use of the products among close family members than among the public.",
        "These results suggest some support for product efficacy but possible concern over potential liability. Pharmacists are also concerned that removing dosing guidelines from packaging may not fully deter parental use of such products."
