        "Rhinoviruses are the most common precipitants of the common cold and have been associated with different infections of the respiratory tract, such as otitis media and sinusitis. They have also been implicated in the induction of acute asthma exacerbations, most of which are preceded by a common cold. Although in several occasions, mainly in immunocompromised hosts, severe lower respiratory tract infections have been attributed to rhinovirus infections, it is still unclear whether and to what extent these viruses contribute as pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia. Current mechanistic data suggest that rhinoviruses could be the cause of pneumonia in immunocompetent subjects. This notion is supported by epidemiological evidence, however, more clinical studies are needed to assess the actual burden."
