        "Physiological functions are a conglomeration of cell functions, and all cells are regulated by information processing and energy distributing systems. The former consists of nervous systems and the latter consists of respiro-circulatory systems. Defensive reactions appear in response to local cold stress which can induce frostbite or edema. We analyzed the cold vasoreaction time course in which rhythmical changes and trends were found using rabbit's ear blood vessels. In sheep, hypobaric hypoxia corresponding to 6600 m altitude was applied for 3 hrs. Lung lymph volume increased in response to this stress. Most sheep exposed recovered later. The factors influencing the increase in lung lymph flow and the conditions to induce interstitial edema were analyzed. Simulated-altitude symptoms were, then, analyzed by Sampson's method. In eight subjects exposed to 3700 m condition, the nervous system symptoms were well correlated with the respiro-circulatory symptoms. Thus we concluded that the distinction between system-specific diseases, viz., that between acute mountain sickness cerebral type (AMS-C) and respiratory type (AMS-R) was somewhat fuzzy. A common AMS condition, AMS-general, exists. Lastly, a case of 22-year-old male who died of lung and cerebral edema on a winter mountain was reported. The lung weighed 1506 g and the brain 1610 g."
