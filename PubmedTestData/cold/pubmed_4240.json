        "To investigate the effect of intercurrent infections, 30 insulin-dependent diabetics and 12 normal subjects were followed prospectively during one winter, with short-term periods of control being assessed by the degree of glycosylation of plasma proteins. Eight diabetics and 7 normal subjects developed an intercurrent infection. During stable control, the diabetics had a mean +/- 1 S.D. glycosylation of 0.90 +/- 0.06 nmol HMF/mg protein/2 hour incubation, compared with the normal subjects of 0.63 +/- 0.04 nmol HMF/mg protein/2 hour. Following infection, there was no increase in glycosylated plasma protein in the normal subjects, but the diabetics increased at 3 and 6 days to 1.07 +/- 0.17 and 1.12 +/- 0.17 nmol HMF/mg protein/2 hour respectively (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01). This was similar to levels (1.09 +/- 0.20 nmol HMF/mg protein/2 hour) found in 12 diabetic subjects admitted to hospital because of marked loss of control with ketonuria. The marked protein glycosylation effect of temporary loss of glucose control following 'minor' intercurrent infections suggests that more attention should be paid to diabetic control during brief illnesses."
