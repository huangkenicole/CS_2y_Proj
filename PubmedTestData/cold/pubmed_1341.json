        "Pathogenic bacteria have been cultured from the osteomeatal complex (OMC) in one-third of adults with apparent acute bacterial sinusitis; however, it is not known whether bacteria are present in the OMC during uncomplicated viral colds in adults.",
        "Adult volunteers were recruited for a study during wellness and at the time of acute common cold. Swab cultures were obtained from the OMC and from the nasopharynx by 2 routes (through the nose and through the mouth). Swab eluates were inoculated on selective agars to detect S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.",
        "Bacterial pathogens were detected in the OMC more frequently during common colds than during wellness (31% vs 8%, p < 0.008). Pathogens detected in the OMC were always present in the nasopharynx of the subject.",
        "Bacterial pathogens are present in the OMC in a subgroup of adult patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory illness/common cold. The nasopharynx appears to be the reservoir for bacterial pathogens in the OMC."
