        "The effect of terfenadine on the plasma concentrations of substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was studied in 7 healthy subjects and 8 subjects with the common cold. Before terfenadine administration, the mean plasma substance P concentration of the subjects with the common cold was significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects. The increased mean plasma substance P concentration of the subjects with the common cold was decreased after terfenadine administration. In the healthy subjects, the mean plasma substance P concentration was unchanged by terfenadine administration. The mean plasma VIP concentration of the subjects with common cold was slightly higher than that of the healthy subjects before and after terfenadine administration, with no significant difference."
