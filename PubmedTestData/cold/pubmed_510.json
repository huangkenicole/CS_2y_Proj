        "Mistletoe preparations have immunomodulatory properties in vitro and in vivo. We wanted to investigate whether or not these properties have an effect on the frequency of the common cold in healthy subjects.",
        "During a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study 16 volunteers received the mistletoe lectin(ML)-poor preparation Iscador Pini(R) (IP), 16 the ML-rich preparation Iscador Quercus spezial(R) (IQ), and 16 placebo (physiological saline solution) twice a week subcutaneously for 12 weeks. Weekly during weeks 1-12 and finally at week 26, a careful history of common cold symptoms was taken. Because the frequency of the common cold was not the main outcome criterion in this study, the number of cases needed to treat was not adjusted to this criterion.",
        "The mean frequency of the common cold during the 12 weeks of injection was 1.5 in the placebo, 1.4 in the IP and 1.1 in the IQ group. During this period in 2.3 (placebo), 1.9 (IP) and 1.4 (IQ) weeks symptoms of common cold were present. The difference in favor to IQ lasted until the end of the observation period in week 26. It was, however, not significant. Leukocyte and granulocyte count as well as C-reactive protein were not different between the groups.",
        "The study showed a trend (p = 0.4, exact Kruskal- Wallis test) to reduced frequency and duration of the common cold in subjects who were exposed to IQ."
