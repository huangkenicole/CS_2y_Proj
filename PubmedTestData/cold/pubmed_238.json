        "Many people seek medical care for cold symptoms. The cold-related knowledge and beliefs of adults seeking medical care for themselves or their children may not correspond with current medical opinion.",
        "A total of 249 parents of symptomatic children and 257 symptomatic adults who sought medical advice in the spring of 1997 from 1 of 3 primary care clinics in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area were surveyed by telephone 48 to 96 hours after contact with the medical system.",
        "Of the adults seeking care for a child or themselves, 44% believed viruses alone cause the common cold: an additional 42% believed both viruses and bacteria play a role. Most thought rest (97%) and nonprescription medications (63%) were helpful for colds, which was consistent with published reports. Contrary to medical reports, however, most felt vitamin C (67%) and the inhalation of steam (70%) reduced cold symptoms, and 44% believed antibiotics help colds (chi2=19.57; P=.0002). But 85% believed colds could resolve on their own.",
        "Those adults seeking medical care for uncomplicated colds are misinformed about the primary cause of the common cold, the use of prescription medications for treating cold symptoms, and the effectiveness of some palliative care techniques. Care providers should address these perceptions rather than enabling overuse of antibiotics."
