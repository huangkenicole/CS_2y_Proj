        "Drug therapy of asthma in the elderly with sympathomimetics, theophylline, steroids, and mucokinetic agents is described, with discussion of dosage evaluation, toxicity, possible drug interactions, and suggested management of common problems. The aspirin hypersensitivity syndrome is reviewed, with an admonition to avoid this drug in asthmatic patients who have nasal polyps, nasal obstruction, or sinusitis, especially patients over the age of 30. The treatments of coughs and colds, and common respiratory infections such as tuberculosis and bronchitis, in the elderly are also outlined. Antihistamines are not advised for elderly patients who have viral or bacterial infections of the nose or throat, and oral preparations containing nasal mucosal vasoconstrictors should also be avoided in managing the elderly patient who has hypertension, vascular disease, or prostatism. Cough suppressants must be used with care, especially if cough is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Special attention is given to the role of oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
