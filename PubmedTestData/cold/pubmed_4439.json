      "AbstractText": [
        "The European common lizard Lacerta vivipara, a reptile of cold-temperate climates, provides us an interesting model of low-temperature adaptation. Indeed its unique cold-hardiness strategy, which employs both freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance, may be seen as the primary reason for its large distribution, which extends from Spain to beyond the Arctic circle. To study the metabolism supporting this capacity, we used three techniques: two techniques of calorimetry (oxygen consumption and thermogenesis) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These techniques were used to examine the metabolic balance and the different molecular pathways used between three different periods through the year (September, January, and May). The results show a significant 20% augmentation of winter anaerobic metabolism compared to other periods of the year. This is mainly because of an activation of the lactic fermentation pathway leading to an increase of lactate concentration (>34% in winter). Furthermore, glucose, which increases some 245% in winter, is used as antifreeze and metabolic substrate. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that the physiological adaptations of the common lizard differ from those of other ectotherms such as Rana sylvatica. Concentrations of alanine and glycerol, commonly used as antifreeze by many overwintering ectotherms, do not increase during winter."
