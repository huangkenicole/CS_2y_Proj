        "The common cold is a highly prevalent illness with significant impact on society and health care. Common cold with heat syndrome (CCHS) is one of the most common types based on syndrome differentiation by traditional Uighur medicine (TUM), which is widely used in Central Asia. The study is designed to explore the efficacy, safety and optimal therapeutic dosage of Binafuxi granules in treating CCHS.",
        "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial. Participants (n = 240) will be enrolled from five centers across China and randomly assigned to the high-dose group, low-dose group or placebo control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. All eligible patients will receive test drugs twice daily for 3\u2009days. The primary outcome is the time to fever relief. Secondary outcomes include the time to fever clearance, duration of primary symptoms and each symptom and change in TUM symptom score.",
        "This is the first placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of a Uighur medicine in treating common cold. It will provide robust evidence on the efficacy and safety of Binafuxi granules in the treatment of CCHS.",
