        "To determine objective and subjective endpoints most suitable for evaluating antitussive efficacy of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM) in children. Spontaneous resolution of acute cough and large placebo effects are impediments to evaluating antitussive efficacy. Another impediment is paucity of age-appropriate, validated cough assessment tools.",
        "This was a multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pilot clinical study in children, aged 6-11 years, with cough due to the common cold. Eligible subjects met entry criteria and qualified by completing a run-in period where coughs were recorded with a cough monitor after they were dosed with sweet syrup. They were subsequently randomized to receive DXM or placebo over 4 days. Coughs were recorded during the initial 24\u2009h; subjective assessments of cough severity and frequency were self-reported daily during treatment.",
        "Data from 128 evaluable subjects (67 DXM; 61 placebo) were analyzed. Total coughs over 24-hours (primary endpoint) and cough frequency during daytime were reduced by 21.0% and 25.5%, respectively, with DXM relative to placebo. Also, greater reductions in cough severity and frequency were self-reported with DXM. These findings were statistically significant and medically relevant. No effects were detected between treatments for nighttime cough rates or impact of cough on sleep. Multiple doses of DXM and placebo were generally well-tolerated.",
        "Evidence of DXM antitussive efficacy was shown in children using objective and subjective assessment tools validated in pediatric populations. Diurnal variation of cough frequency over 24\u2009h reduced the assay sensitivity needed to detect treatment differences at nighttime, as coughs/hour decreased during sleep for both groups."
