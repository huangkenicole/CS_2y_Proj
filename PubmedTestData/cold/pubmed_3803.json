        "To study circadian variation in the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and possible associations with risk factors for SIDS.",
        "A questionnaire-based case-control study matched for place of birth, age and gender was conducted in Denmark, Norway and Sweden: The Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study. The study comprised 244 SIDS victims and 869 control infants between September 1992 and August 1995. The main outcome was hour found dead.",
        "A significant circadian pattern was observed among the 242 SIDS victims with a known hour found dead, with a peak at 08.00-08.59 in the morning (n = 33). Of the SIDS victims, 12% were found dead at 00.00-05.59, 58% at 06.00-11.59, 21% at 12.00-17.59 and 9.0% at 18.00-23.59. When comparing night/morning SIDS and day/evening SIDS (found dead 00.00-11.59 and 12.00-23.59, respectively), the proportion of night/morning SIDS was high among infants of smoking mothers (81% vs 53%, p < 0.001), infants with a reported cold (82% vs 64%, p = 0.007) and infants sleeping side/supine (81% vs 60%, p < 0.001). No associations were observed between hour found dead and other sociodemographic risk factors for SIDS. Risk (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval) of night/morning SIDS and day/evening SIDS was 7.0 (4.5-10.9) and 1.5 (0.8-2.5), respectively, for maternal smoking, 2.2 (1.5-3.1) and 0.6 (0.3-1.3), respectively, if the infant had a reported cold, 3.7 (2.1-6.6) and 3.1 (1.1-8.4), respectively, if the infant was put to sleep in the side position (supine reference), and 11.0 (5.9-20.2) and 21.6 (7.6-60.8), respectively, if the infant was put to sleep in the prone position.",
        "The observed higher proportion of night/morning cases in SIDS if the mother smoked, if the infant was reported to have a cold and if the infant was sleeping side/supine may contribute to the understanding of some epidemiological characteristics of SIDS."
