        "Four laboratory experiments were designed to study the efficacy of the only available commercial vaccine for turkey coryza, Art-Vax. Poults were vaccinated either once or twice at different ages and challenged with pathogenic Alcaligenes faecalis. In another study, commercial turkeys vaccinated at 1 and 12 days of age on a commercial farm were brought to the laboratory for challenge with pathogenic A. faecalis. Both the laboratory- and field-vaccinated poults were given the manufacturer's recommended dosage of the vaccine strain. Regardless of the vaccine schedule or source of poults, the vaccine was not effective in protecting challenged turkeys from infection. Furthermore, the vaccine was not effective in protecting poults less than 3 weeks of age from disease, but it was effective in protecting poults more than 3 weeks of age from disease. These results indicate that although vaccinated turkeys older than 3 weeks of age were not susceptible to disease, they were susceptible to infection and could act as carriers of field strains of A. faecalis, thus perpetuating the risk of infection to flocks subsequently raised in the same buildings."
