        "The effects and consequences of anaesthesia in a child with a respiratory tract infection (RTI) are controversial. There is a high incidence of viral RTI in children presenting for surgery and anaesthesia. The social and economic impact of postponing the procedure is significant; for the child, family and institution. The clinical effects of the common cold are well known, affecting the respiratory tract from the nose down to the small airways and lung parenchyma. The systemic effects of the toxic viraemic phase are also well recognized but not so the potential risk of a viral myocarditis. There is an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative respiratory related complications up to six weeks after a RTI. These include airway obstruction, laryngeal spasm, vagally mediated reflex bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, desaturation, atelectasis and postoperative respiratory complications. Children with symptoms of a moderate to severe RTI presenting for elective surgery should be postponed for six weeks. Emergency surgery should proceed with a mask anaesthetic for minor surgery or by adopting a modified rapid sequence induction (atropine but no cricoid pressure) to gain rapid control of the airway to avoid laryngeal spasm and vagally mediated reflex bronchoconstriction; IPPV, awake extubation, postoperative monitoring of respiratory function and appropriate analgesia."
