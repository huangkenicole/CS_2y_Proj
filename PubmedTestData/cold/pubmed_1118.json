        "Infections are common in children attending daycare centres (DCCs). We evaluated the effect of a hand hygiene (HH) intervention for caregivers on the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children. The intervention was evaluated in a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Thirty-six DCCs received the intervention including HH products, training sessions, and posters/stickers. Thirty-five control DCCs continued usual practice. Incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold in children was monitored by parents during 6 months. Using multilevel Poisson regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. Diarrhoeal incidence was monitored in 545 children for 91 937 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 3\u00b70 episodes per child-year in intervention DCCs vs. 3\u00b74 in control DCCs (IRR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b711). Incidence of the common cold was monitored in 541 children for 91 373 days. During follow-up, the incidence was 8\u00b72 episodes per child-year in intervention DCCs vs. 7\u00b74 in control DCCs (IRR 1\u00b707, 95% CI 0\u00b797-1\u00b719). In this study, no evidence for an effect of the intervention was demonstrated on the incidence of episodes of diarrhoea and the common cold."
