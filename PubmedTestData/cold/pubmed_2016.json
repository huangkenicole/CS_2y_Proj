      "AbstractText": [
        "A 10 year old boy with a superior division palsy of the left oculomotor nerve is reported. He had a flu-like illness 1 week before the onset. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were normal. Laboratory data for evaluation of infection, diabetes mellitus and myasthenia gravis were normal. The symptoms spontaneously disappeared after 2 months. The course of the illness in conjunction with the negative laboratory findings made this case an example of partial paralysis of the third nerve related to viral infection. In the literature, only several cases with isolated divisional palsy of the oculomotor nerve were found after a viral infection. Inferior division palsy has been reported in five children. Superior division palsy has been published in only two cases. Divisional palsy is more common among children and resolves spontaneously. This rare but important clinical entity is one of the differential diagnoses in oculomotor nerve palsies, particularly in children, which are neuroradiologically undiagnosed. It occurs after a viral infection and may affect a superior or inferior division alone."
