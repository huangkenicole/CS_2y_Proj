        "We propose the term \"common cold coronaviruses,\" or ccCoV, to describe the four human coronaviruses commonly associated with upper respiratory tract disease - coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. This will differentiate these previously described coronaviruses from those causing more severe disease in humans - including the viruses severe acute respiraotry syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2."
