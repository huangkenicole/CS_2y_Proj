        "This study investigated the decisions which Japanese paediatricians make regarding bathing a child with a common cold.",
        "A total of 486 printed questionnaires were mailed to paediatricians systematically sampled from the list of members of the Japanese Pediatric Association. The questionnaire included two main questions. (i) Do you permit a 2- to 4-year-old child with a common cold to take a bath? (ii) If the answer to (i) was 'yes', what conditions should limit bathing of such children, and if the answer was 'no', why do you forbid bathing? In addition, the questionnaire included the age and sex of the practitioner, and the type and location of the practice.",
        "A total of 269 paediatricians returned questionnaires (response rate 55%); of these, 88% permitted a child with a cold to take a bath. Of these paediatricians, 5% permitted it without any conditions. The main conditions for taking a bath indicated by these paediatricians were 'no fever' (72%), 'not in a severe physical condition' (27%) and 'after 2 or 3 days from onset' (19%). Thirty-nine paediatricians indicated a specific body temperature at which bathing was appropriate. One-third of these paediatricians did not permit bathing at body temperatures above 38 degrees C. Of the 31 paediatricians (12%) who answered that a child with a cold should not take a bath, 61% were concerned for the physical well-being of the child. However, 29% provided no supporting evidence.",
        "Japanese paediatricians' judgements concerning bathing of a child with a cold are related to the effects of bathing on physical condition. Bathing immersed up to the neck does not always affect physical conditions. It is necessary to establish appropriate parental and patient education concerning bathing of children with colds."
