        "Acute sore throat (ST) can occur as part of a common cold of viral origin or caused by pharyngeal bacterial pathogens. The majority of patients with acute ST complain of pain on swallowing and dry scratchiness which can have a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to evaluate the time to pain relief in patients with acute ST, following a single administration of benzydamine hydrochloride (HCl) 0.3% oromucosal spray or benzydamine HCl 3\u2009mg lozenges.",
        "This multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, open label, parallel-group, international phase IV study was conducted at 12 investigational centers in Poland, Hungary, and Russian Federation. The study population consisted of 363 adult patients with recent onset (\u22643 days) of ST and a diagnosis of tonsillopharyngitis. The primary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of benzydamine HCl in ST pain relief at 2 minutes after a single-dose administration. Secondary endpoints included, among others, the assessment of a first perceived ST relief at 1 minute after a single-dose administration of benzydamine HCl spray or lozenge.",
        "Both the spray and lozenges are effective in providing a ST relief starting already at 2 minutes after a single administration, with an effect lasting up to up to 4 hours. Clinical efficacy after 7 days of treatment and a good safety profile were also demonstrated.",
        "Anesthetic and analgesic properties of benzydamine spray and lozenges effectively addressed the patient priority of a rapid relief of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI)."
