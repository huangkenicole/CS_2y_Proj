        "Viral infection is one of important factors to cause the exacerbation of bronchial asthma. We have investigated 167 adults of asthmatics to clarify the correlation between viral infection and exacerbation of asthma. Patients were classified to four group by the symptoms of common cold and asthma attack. Furthermore, we have examined Picornavirus and Human rhino virus RNA from throat gargles of patients using RT-PCR (reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction) method. Forty of 65 (61.5%) asthmatics with common cold revealed asthma attack and common cold was significantly associated with acute exacerbation of asthma (p < 0.01). We identified Picornavirus RNA, which include 113 of Human rhino virus serotypes and enterovirus, from the samples of 16 of 52 (30.8%) patients who had acute exacerbation. It was significantly higher than the detection rate of viral RNA from patient without asthma attack. Furthermore, we analyzed Human rhino virus RNA from the same samples by RT-PCR and 93.7% of Picornavirus were identified as Human rhino virus. Taken together, these findings suggest that common cold is significantly associated with the exacerbation of bronchial asthma. Human rhino virus infection might be one of important virus in this procedure."
