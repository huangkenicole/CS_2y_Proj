        "Japanese cedar pollinosis (Type I allergy to Japanese cedar pollen) shows a high incidence in spring in Japan, demonstrating symptoms such as pituita, rhinostenosis, lacrimation and sometimes pharyngeal pain. The following study investigated whether expired nitric oxide (NO) concentration is increased in Japanese cedar pollinosis, and whether expired NO concentration can be used to discriminate from cold syndrome which symptoms are similar to Japanese cedar pollinosis.",
        "In 20 healthy subjects, 20 patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis and 20 patients with cold syndrome, expired NO concentrations derived from nasal cavity and those derived from airway and lung were measured. Expired NO concentrations derived from nasal cavity and those derived from airway and lung were compared among the groups.",
        "In patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis expired NO concentrations derived from nasal cavity and those derived from airway and lung markedly increased. In patients with cold syndrome there were no significant increases in these concentrations.",
        "It is considered that expired NO concentration is useful for discriminating Japanese cedar pollinosis from cold syndrome. It seems interesting that not only expired NO concentrations derived from nasal cavity but also those derived from airway and lung were clevated. Generalized airway inflammation may be present, even without clinical asthma, in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis."
