        "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of gargling in treating colds which were self-reported by subjects. Workers in a foundry affiliated with a motor corporation were subject to monthly questionnaire surveys from January to March, 1994. They were assigned to the intervention group or to the non-intervention group as controls. The subjects in the intervention group were guided but not enforced to gargle with a remote foot pedal-operated gargling apparatus 3 times during daily work over a 3-month period. Statistical analysis of all data from questionnaires was done by chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability test with 2 x 2 (partially m x 1) correlation tables. The occurrence rate for colds based on the self-reported questionnaire was significantly lower in the intervention group with the significantly higher gargling compliance rate than in the non-intervention group throughout the study period. The rate of sick leave in the intervention group, as well as that of medication, also tended to be lower than in the control group. The results presented suggest that the rate of gargling compliance will be an important factor in the prevention of colds and in health care in a collective such as a workshop or a school."
