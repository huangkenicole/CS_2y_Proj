        "Recent upper respiratory infection (URI) in children increases respiratory adverse events following anesthesia for elective surgery. The increased risk continues weeks after resolution of acute URI symptoms. Few systematic analyses have explored specific risk factors. This logistic regression explores the relationship between preoperative URI symptoms and adverse events during emergence from anesthesia.",
        "Data were combined from control groups of several prospective observational and interventional studies in elective pediatric anesthesia in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. In each study, a blinded observer, distinct from the anesthesia care team, prospectively recorded the presence of stridor, oxygen desaturations (and their duration), coughing and laryngospasm. Parents were subsequently asked about the presence of 10 cold symptoms during the 6 weeks prior to operation.",
        "Our model, based on a dataset of 335 patients, did not demonstrate an association between any particular symptoms and the rate of respiratory adverse events during emergence from anesthesia, with the exception of low-grade fever which appeared to be mildly protective. Respiratory adverse events were affected by the airway management technique (device used and timing of extubation), and adverse events were increased if peak URI symptoms had occurred within the preceding 4 weeks.",
        "Specific preoperative symptoms were not useful in predicting respiratory adverse events during emergence from anesthesia."
