        "The purpose of this study was to examine the association between experimental rhinovirus infection and the elaboration of interleukin-8 (IL-8) into nasal secretions of volunteers and to determine the effect of pentoxifylline on IL-8 elaboration and rhinovirus-associated common cold symptoms. Fifty-four subjects with experimental rhinovirus infections and 20 sham-inoculated subjects were studied. Pentoxifylline had no effect on rhinovirus-induced symptoms or nasal-secretion IL-8 concentrations. IL-8 concentrations were significantly greater in nasal secretions from infected symptomatic subjects than in those from infected asymptomatic or sham-challenged subjects on days 2-4 after virus challenge. In infected subjects, there was significant rank correlation between nasal obstruction severity, rhinorrhea severity, and nasal-wash albumin concentrations and the change in IL-8 concentration from baseline on days 2-4 after virus challenge."
