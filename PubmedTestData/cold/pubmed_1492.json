      "AbstractText": [
        "Soshiho-tang (SST) is widely used to treat common cold in East Asian countries. Many clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of SST formulas for the treatment of pediatric common cold have been reported. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the available clinical evidence on the use of SST formulas in the treatment for common cold in children younger than 12 years.",
        "Fifteen databases will be searched from their inception until March 2019. We will be including the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing all types of SST formulas used in the treatment of common cold in children younger than 12 years. The methodological qualities of the RCTs will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias, while confidence in the cumulative evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation instrument.",
        "This systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will also be disseminated electronically and in print. The review will be updated to inform and guide health care practices."
