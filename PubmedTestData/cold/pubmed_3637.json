        "Rhinovirus (RV) has been linked to the pathogenesis of asthma. Prematurity is a risk factor for severe RV infection in early life, but is unknown if RV elicits enhanced pro-asthmatic airway cytokine responses in premature infants. This study investigated whether young children born severely premature (<32\u00a0wks gestation) exhibit airway secretion of Th2 and Th17 cytokines during natural RV infections and whether RV-induced Th2-Th17 responses are linked to more respiratory morbidity in premature children during the first 2\u00a0yrs of life.",
        "We measured Th2 and Th17 nasal airway cytokines in a retrospective cohort of young children aged 0-2\u00a0yrs with PCR-confirmed RV infection or non-detectable virus. Protein levels of IL-4, IL-13, TSLP, and IL-17 were determined with multiplex immunoassays. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained by electronic medical record (EMR) review.",
        "The study comprised 214 children born full term (n\u00a0=\u00a0108), preterm (n\u00a0=\u00a044) or severely premature (n\u00a0=\u00a062). Natural RV infection in severely premature children was associated with elevated airway secretion of Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines, particularly in subjects with history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Severely premature children with high RV-induced airway IL-4 had recurrent respiratory hospitalizations (median 3.65 hosp/yr; IQR 2.8-4.8) and were more likely to have at least one pediatric intensive care unit admission during the first 2\u00a0yrs of life (OR 8.72; 95% CI 1.3-58.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).",
