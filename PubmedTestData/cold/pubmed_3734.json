        "In recent years, traditional diets enriched with fresh plant-based foods have been gradually abandoned, increasing the consumption of animal foods and highly processed food. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a nutritional intervention with a Traditional Mediterranean Diet in patients with recurring colds (RC) and frequent inflammatory complications (IC).",
        "Prospective before-after comparison study of 63 girls and 65 boys aged 1-5 years were included over a year in the nutritional programme \"Learning to eat from the Mediterranean\". We studied clinical and therapeutic variables and various anthropometric parameters.",
        "All the studied indicators (number of catarrhal episodes CB, degree of intensity, emergency and hospital admissions) showed a positive and statistically significant evolution, evidenced from the first weeks of starting treatment, until the end of the year, after which 53.9% of patients had no CB, 25% had only one, and 16.4% had two episodes, compared to the 4.64 episodes on average in the previous year. Antibiotic use decreased by 87.4%, from 3.85\u00b11.27 times/patient/year to 0.49\u00b10.79 (p<0.001). Symptomatic treatment decreased by 56.7%, from 7.03\u00b12.76 to 3.05\u00b11.69 (p<0.001). The satisfaction of the families was very high. The Kidmed index, which assesses the quality of the Mediterranean Diet, increased from 7.8 to 10.9 points.",
        "The adoption of a Traditional Mediterranean Diet could be a major contribution to the improvement of patients with recurring colds and frequent inflammatory complications."
