        "In pediatric patients, the common cold coronavirus (ccCoV) usually causes mild respiratory illness. There are reports of coronavirus causing central nervous system (CNS) infection in experimental animal models. Some immunocompromised patients have also been reported to have fatal CNS infections with ccCoV. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of CNS complications related to ccCoV infection.",
        "From January 2014 to December 2019, a retrospective analysis was performed of medical records from hospitalized patients under 19 years of age whose ccCoV was detected through polymerase chain reaction in respiratory specimens. The CNS complications were defined as clinically diagnosed seizure, meningitis, encephalopathy, and encephalitis.",
        "A total of 436 samples from 420 patients were detected as ccCoV. Among the 420 patients, 269 patients were immunocompetent and 151 patients were immunocompromised. The most common type of ccCoV was OC43 (52% in immunocompetent, 37% in immunocompromised). CNS complications were observed in 9.4% (41/436). The most common type of CNS complication was the fever-provoked seizure under pre-existing neurologic disease (42% in immunocompetent and 60% in immunocompromised patients). Among patients with CNS complications, two immunocompetent patients required intensive care unit admission due to encephalitis. Three patients without underlying neurological disease started anti-seizure medications for the first time at this admission. There was no death related to ccCoV infection.",
        "ccCoV infection may cause severe clinical manifestations such as CNS complications or neurologic sequelae, even in previously healthy children."
