        "To assess changes in public knowledge, attitudes, and reported behaviour of antibiotic use in the management of the common cold and to compare with results of a 1998 study. The context is a nationwide project to reduce the consumption of antibiotics.",
        "Cross-section survey: telephone interviews of random sample of consenting Auckland telephone subscribers aged over 15 years comparing 1998 and 2003 responses.",
        "A 55% response rate of eligible participants was recorded. No change was noted between 1998 and 2003 in public awareness that antibiotics are not helpful in treating viral infections (38%). However there was a significant reduction in those attending doctor for the common cold (24% to 15%). In 2003, patients were less likely to receive antibiotic prescription and more likely to receive a delayed prescription.",
        "The majority of general public still do not understand that the common cold does not need antibiotic treatment. The advertising campaign may have reduced doctor prescribing hence the reduction in antibiotic use from 1998 to 2003."
