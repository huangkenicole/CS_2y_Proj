      "AbstractText": [
        "The common cold (CC) is the most common syndromes of infection in human beings, but there is currently no special treatment. For this reason, acupuncture is used to relieve the symptoms of the CC. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy that has been used for over 2000 years to treat various diseases. However, few studies have provided evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the CC. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture on CC periods and its symptoms.",
        "The following electronic databases will be searched for studies conducted through January 1, 2019: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBASE, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Springer, Wan-fang database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and other sources. All randomized controlled trials on acupuncture for common cold will be included. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, while RevMan V.5.3.5 software will be implemented for the assessment of bias risk, data synthesis, subgroup analysis, and meta-analyses if conditions are met. Continuous outcomes will be presented as mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD), while dichotomous data will be expressed as relative risk.",
        "A high-quality synthesis of current evidence of acupuncture for CC will be stated from several aspect using subjective reports and objective measures of performance. The reduction rate of common cold symptoms after initial treatment, resolved cold symptoms, and reduced cold duration will be collected.",
        "This protocol will present the evidence of whether acupuncture therapy is an effective intervention for CC."
