        "We report a case of eosinophilic pneumonia induced by Pelex granule. A 31-year-old male patient had been treated with Pelex granule and other drugs for common-cold symptoms such as cough and fever. Since these symptoms were persistent, he was admitted to our hospital for further examination. His laboratory findings showed eosinophilia and a mild elevation of serum IgE. Chest radiography revealed a reticular shadow and patchy shadows in both lung fields. Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed an increased percentage of eosinophils. The histological findings of the specimen obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy showed infiltration of eosniophils into the alveolar walls and spaces. After withdrawal of all drugs, the patient's clinical findings-symptoms, laboratory data, and chest radiographic findings-soon improved. A lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) for Pelex granule was positive. Taken together, the case was diagnosed as eosinophilic pneumonia induced by Pelex granule."
