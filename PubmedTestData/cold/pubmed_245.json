        "Beliefs and practices of 100 urban mothers regarding \"hot\" and \"cold\" foods during four common childhood illnesses were determined by using a pretested, partly structured interview schedule. Egg, by 60% of mothers, mango by 52%, lentils by 49%, jaggery by 46% were considered \"hot\" properties. \"Hot\" foods were preferred and \"cold\" foods restricted in the treatment of cough and cold and illnesses with rash. In diarrhoea, \"cold\" foods were preferred and \"hot\" foods restricted. The knowledge that many food combinations and certain procedures are believed to change the properties of common food may be utilized in promoting the consumption of nutritionally balanced diets. Introduction of culturally acceptable education in nutrition which incorporates the above knowledge is likely to help in the prevention of protein-energy malnutrition and to increase parental co-operation during therapy."
