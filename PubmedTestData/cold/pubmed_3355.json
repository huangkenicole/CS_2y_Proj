        "Rhinorrhea from common colds or allergies in children is similar to that in adults, yet there are few data on the use of ipratropium bromide nasal spray in children younger than 5 years.",
        "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.06% ipratropium bromide nasal spray in 2- to 5-year-old children with rhinorrhea from a common cold or allergies.",
        "A total of 230 children (43 with common colds and 187 with allergies) participated in an open-label, multicenter study. Patients with a common cold received ipratropium bromide nasal spray (84 microg per nostril) 3 times daily for 4 days; those with allergies received ipratropium bromide nasal spray (42 microg per nostril) 3 times daily for 14 days.",
        "In the common cold and allergy groups, 91% and 90% of the parents, respectively, found that ipratropium bromide was either \"very useful\" or \"somewhat useful.\" Furthermore, 67% and 91% of parents in the common cold and allergy groups, respectively, found that administration of a nasal spray was either \"extremely easy\" or \"very easy.\" Symptom scores were improved from baseline in both groups. The nasal spray was well tolerated and was not associated with serious or systemic anticholinergic adverse effects. Most adverse events were infrequent and mild to moderate, and study discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred in less than 3% of patients.",
        "The 0.06% ipratropium bromide nasal spray, 42 or 84 microg per nostril 3 times daily, is easy to administer, safe, and effective for the control of rhinorrhea in children aged 2 to 5 years with a common cold or allergies."
