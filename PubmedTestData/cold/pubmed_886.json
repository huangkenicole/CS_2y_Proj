        "Past studies suggest that the majority of new otitis media (OM) diagnoses is a complication of a colds/flu. A prospective format was used to determine the coincidence of otitis media and parent diagnosed cold/flu episodes in young children followed over a typical cold/flu season.",
        "Eighteen families with children aged 1-8 years were followed from October 1 to April 30 using parent-completed daily diaries focused on cold/flu signs and weekly examinations using pneumatic otoscopy for diagnosis of the presence/absence of otitis media.",
        "Overall, 108 cold episodes were documented in 36 enrolled children with 20 colds (19%) occurring during a pre-existing OM episode and 40 colds (37%) complicated by a new OM episode. Conversely, there were 82 new OM episodes, 40 (49%) were associated with a cold in the individual child and 18 (22%) with a concurrent cold in a family member. The median duration of the OM episodes was approximately 2 weeks but this was longer for OM episodes where earache was reported.",
        "The results confirm past observation relating new OM episodes to a concurrent cold/flu but show these episodes to usually be of short duration. Two sources of potential bias were identified for point prevalence study formats: the presence of a pre-existing OM for a new onset cold/flu and the possibility of subclinical colds in patients with new OM episodes. These biases reinforce the need for longitudinal study formats to address this important relationship."
