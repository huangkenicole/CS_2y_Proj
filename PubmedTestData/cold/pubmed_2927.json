      "AbstractText": [
        "A previously unidentified species of human rhinovirus, HRV-C, was described in 2006 in association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Features of infection in immunosuppressed adults are poorly characterised.",
        "This study aims to determine the epidemiology of HRV-C in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients in a single centre.",
        "A prospective cohort study of all HSCT recipients admitted to Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia from 1 July 2005 to 30 September 2007 was undertaken. Nose/throat samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission and patients developing pre-defined symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection during the admission. Samples were processed and tested for rhinoviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses using nucleic acid-based methods, immunofluorescence and culture. HRV genotyping was performed by sequencing a region of the rhinovirus 5' untranslated region (UTR). Clinical data on each episode were collected prospectively.",
        "HRVs were identified in 24 episodes: 8% of 299 episodes of clinically- defined respiratory infections and 39% of 61 episodes in which respiratory viruses were detected. HRV-C was most frequent (HRV-C: nine, HRV-A: eight and HRV-B: two). Seven episodes of HRV-C, five with pneumonia, occurred within 100 days of HSCT. Co-pathogens were frequent.",
        "The newly described HRV-C was the most common rhinovirus group detected in HSCT recipients with respiratory infection, with co-pathogens being frequent. Further research is required to understand the activity and pathogenicity of this virus in HSCT recipients."
