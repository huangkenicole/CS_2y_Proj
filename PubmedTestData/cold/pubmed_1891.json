        "This study aims to explore the impacts of knowledge and attitude on the behavior of antibiotic use during the treatment of the common cold based on the expanding KAP model, and then identify the critical behavioral stage.",
        "A cross-sectional study was conducted on 815 public from 21 community health centers (CHCs) in Chongqing, China. Based on the expanding KAP model, a self-administered questionnaire was designed to measure knowledge, attitude, multi-stage behavior, and perceived threat, in which multi-stage behavior was divided into pre-use antibiotic behavior, during-use antibiotic behavior, and post-use antibiotic behavior. A structural equation model was used to examine the model fit and the direct, indirect, mediating effects, and moderating effect of the variables.",
        "The expanding KAP showed good model fit indices with \u03c7\u00b2/df\u2009=\u20090.537, RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.033, CFI\u2009=\u20090.973, GFI\u2009=\u20090.971, NFI\u2009=\u20090.934, TLI\u2009=\u20090.979. Knowledge had a positive effect on attitude (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.503, p\u2009<\u20090.05), pre-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.348, p\u2009<\u20090.05), during-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.461, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and post-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.547, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Attitude had a positive effect on during-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.296, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and post-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.747, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The mediating effect of attitude was positive among knowledge, during-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.149, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and post-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.376, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Perceived threat also had a positive moderating effect between knowledge and post-use antibiotic behavior (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.021, p\u2009<\u20090.001).",
        "Knowledge, attitude and perceived threat had different effects on different stages of antibiotic behavior. The critical behavioral stage prioritized the post-use antibiotic behavior and during-use antibiotic behavior over pre-use antibiotic behavior."
