        "Common cold is known as a serious clinical problem worldwide. Coronaviruses have long been identified as respiratory pathogens causing \"common cold\" in healthy people. The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus as a serious public health problem and concern has resulted in severe illness and death especially in the elderly. COVID-19 is picking up pace around the world and has spread to more than 219 countries. Due to the very easy spread of COVID-19 and its lack of recognized appropriate treatments and vaccines as well as potential\u00a0therapeutic effects of several traditional herbal remedies, we decided to gather, evaluate, and compare the potential pharmacological effects of medicinal herbs from Avicenna's perspective and modern medicine with antiviral properties which may lead to the discovery of suitable traditional treatments to prevent or reduce the adverse symptoms of common cold."
