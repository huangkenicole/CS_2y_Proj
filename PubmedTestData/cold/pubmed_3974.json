        "Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-generation effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or generation. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-generation effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult Calliphora vicina to present-day (15\u00b0C) and future (20\u00b0C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=-18.9\u00b10.9\u00b0C) compared with D20 (-15.3\u00b10.8\u00b0C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to -4\u00b0C (LT50=26.0\u00b11.0 and 11.4\u00b11.1 days, respectively) and -8\u00b0C (5.1\u00b11.1 and 3.0\u00b11.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4\u00b10.3 g mg(-1)) compared with D20 (3.0\u00b10.3 g mg(-1)) larvae. In conclusion, C. vicina adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon."
