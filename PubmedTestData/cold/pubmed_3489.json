        "Diagnosis has a major impact on the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We studied patients with SAH who were admitted to our hospital in an effort to identify ways to prevent misdiagnosis.",
        "A total of 494 patients with SAH were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery from 2003 through 2010. Misdiagnosis occurred in 30 patients (6.1%). We studied the symptoms and the types of misdiagnoses in these 30 patients.",
        "Misdiagnosis occurred 37 times in the 30 patients (6 patients were given more than 1 misdiagnosis). There were 3 types of misdiagnoses. Type 1 cases were misdiagnosed as a common cold, type 2 cases were misdiagnosed as circulatory organ disease, and type 3 cases were misdiagnosed as digestive organ disease.",
        "Type 1 cases were mild, and diagnosis required detailed medical history analyses. Type 2 cases were severe and were diagnosed based on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes characteristic of SAH. Symptoms of type 3 cases included vomiting, and diagnosis required recognition of meningeal irritation syndrome and detailed medical history analyses."
