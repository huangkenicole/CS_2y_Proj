        "From July 2017 through June 2018, a total of 478 members of the active (n=402) and reserve (n=76) components had at least one medical encounter with a primary diagnosis of cold injury. The crude overall incidence rate of cold injury for all active component service members in 2017-2018 was 19.6% higher than the rate for the 2016-2017 cold season and was the highest rate since the 2013-2014 season. Frostbite was the most common type of cold injury among active component service members in 2017-2018. Among active component members during the 2013-2018 cold seasons, overall rates of cold injuries were generally highest among males, non-Hispanic black service members, the youngest (less than 20 years old), and those who were enlisted. As noted in prior <i>MSMR</i> updates, the rate of all cold injuries among active component Army members was considerably higher in females than in males due to a much higher rate of frostbite among female soldiers. The numbers of cold injuries associated with overseas deployments have fallen precipitously in the past three cold seasons and included 17 cases in the most recent year."
