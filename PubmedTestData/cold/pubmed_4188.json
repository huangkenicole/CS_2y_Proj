        "The aggregation of two or more individuals of the same species (huddling) is common in mammals and birds, especially in the cold. The physical contact reduces the weight-specific body surface exposed to the environment, thus lowering heat loss and the thermogenic needs. This study investigated the possibility that the mere presence of a conspecific, in absence of physical contact, may by itself influence metabolic rate during cold. The oxygen consumption (Vo<sub>2</sub>) of pairs of chicken hatchlings was measured when the hatchlings were in isolation (individuals), together in the respirometer but kept separated by a grid (separated) or together in the respirometer free to huddle (together), in random order, in warm (ambient normothermia, 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and cold conditions (26\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0h). In warm, Vo<sub>2</sub> did not differ significantly among individuals, separated and together (~ 1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0ml O<sub>2</sub>/min). During the whole cold period, Vo<sub>2</sub> of individuals exceeded the value by 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0ml of O<sub>2</sub>, significantly more than in separated (15.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0ml O<sub>2</sub>, P<0.01) and together (13.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0ml O<sub>2</sub>; P<0.001). Separated and together did not differ significantly. Vo<sub>2</sub> in the cold averaged 149\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% of the value measured in normothermia in isolated, 132\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% in separated and 128\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% in together. By the end of the cold-exposure, Vo<sub>2</sub> averaged 166\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% of normothermia in isolated, 146\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% in separated and 140\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% in together. In all cases, values of isolated significantly exceeded those of separated (P<0.01) and together (P<0.0001), while separated and together did not differ from each other (P>0.05; Two-way RM ANOVA). Hence, in this experimental model, social interaction without physical contact decreased the thermogenic response to cold as much as huddling did. Presumably, during the cold exposure, social interaction lowered the additional energetic cost of the stress of isolation."
