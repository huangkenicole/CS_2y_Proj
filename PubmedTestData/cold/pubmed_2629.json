        "Epidemiological data demonstrate that viral infections are the most important trigger for acute asthma symptoms in children, and this association persists in many adults with asthma. Studies on volunteers experimentally infected with rhinoviruses (RV) suggest that atopy alone does not predispose to unusually severe symptoms. In contrast, experimental models combining viral infection and allergen exposure have identified potential links between virus-induced and allergen-induced inflammation. While in vitro studies suggest that cytokines may be an important part of this association, their role must be verified by sampling lower airway fluids and tissues in vivo after experimental and/or natural rhinovirus infections. Although it has long been recognized that the common cold is a potent trigger for symptoms of asthma, the mechanisms underlying the association between upper respiratory infection and increased lower airway obstruction remain obscure. The use of experimental infection of volunteers with or without respiratory allergies has enabled direct comparisons of common cold symptoms in these two groups. Furthermore, techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage and segmental antigen challenge have been used to directly sample lower airway fluids and tissues during acute viral infection."
