        "We investigated the relationship between the common cold and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Japanese patients with angina pectoris, because suffering from a common cold during the follow-up period after PCI may be involved in the development of restenosis. In addition, we measured the soluble (s) L-selectin level early after PCI in patients with and without restenosis. The study group included 104 effort angina pectoris patients. We examined whether or not they had had a common cold in the 6 months following angioplasty. Finally, 88 patients, whose common cold status was known, were selected as the study subjects. Twelve patients caught a common cold after PCI. All of these patients were given antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatory agents and recovered within 2 weeks. None had clinically detectable influenza infection. Thirty-three patients suffered from restenosis and 55 did not. There was no significant difference in the restenosis frequency between effort angina pectoris patients with and without a common cold. The sL-selectin level was significantly increased in patients with restenosis early after PCI, whereas in patients without restenosis, sL-selectin remained unchanged. These findings suggest that restenosis development after PCI in patients with effort angina pectoris may involve leukocyte activation early after PCI, while suffering from a common cold during the follow-up period after PCI has no effect."
