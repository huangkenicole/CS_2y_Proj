        "<b>Background:</b> One of the most challenging environmental extremes is immersion in cold/icy water, and consequent common assumption is that even a brief exposure to cold can lead to cold-related illnesses. The increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) in response to acute cold stress are thought to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines. No previous study has explored the residual consequences of whole-body short-term cold-water immersion (CWI; 14\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min) on the immune response in healthy non-acclimated young adult men (aged 20-30\u2009years).<b>Materials and methods:</b> In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that short-term acute whole-body CWI would induce high blood levels of cortisol, NE, and Epi, which in turn would increase circulating leukocyte numbers and delay the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6). <b>Results:</b> Short-term whole-body CWI produced a stressful physiological reaction, as manifested by hyperventilation and increased muscle shivering, metabolic heat production, and heart rate. CWI also induced the marked release of the stress hormones Epi, NE, and cortisol. The change in IL-6 concentration after CWI was delayed and TNF-\u03b1 production was decreased, but IL-1\u03b2 was not affected within 48\u2009h after CWI. A delayed increase in neutrophil percentage and decrease in lymphocyte percentage occurred after CWI.<b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that, even though CWI caused changes in stress and immune markers, the participants showed no predisposition to symptoms of the common cold within 48\u2009h after CWI."
