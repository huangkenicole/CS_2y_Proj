      "AbstractText": [
        "Cold-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (CAH) is common in bronchial asthma (BA) patients and represents a problem for those living in cold climate. Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel is the main cold temperature sensor in humans that could mediate cold response in asthmatics with CAH. No associations between TRPM8 gene polymorphisms and CAH have been reported.",
        "The present study involved 123 BA patients. CAH was assessed by 3-min isocapnic (5% CO2 ) cold air (-20\u00b0C) hyperventilation challenge. The c.750G\u2009>\u2009C (rs11562975), c.1256G\u2009>\u2009A (rs7593557), c.3048C\u2009>\u2009T (rs11563208) and c.3174C\u2009>\u2009G (rs11563071) polymorphisms of TRPM8 gene were genotyped by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR with subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.",
        "GC genotype and C allele carriers of the c.750G\u2009>\u2009C (rs11562975) polymorphism were more frequently observed to exhibit CAH. The estimated odds ratio for the GC genotype was 3.73 95%CI (1.48; 9.37), P\u2009=\u20090.005. Furthermore, GC heterozygotes had a prominent decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s after the challenge as compared to GG homozygotes (-12% (-16; -8.1) vs -6.45% (-11; -2.1), P\u2009<\u20090.001). GC carriers also had a marked reduction in other spirometric parameters.",
        "The GC variant of the TRPM8:c.750G\u2009>\u2009C (rs11562975) polymorphism is associated with CAH in patients with BA, which suggests a potential role of TRPM8 in CAH development."
