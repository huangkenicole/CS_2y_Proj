        "Evaluate effects of a multisymptom tablet on cold and flu symptoms within 4 hours post-administration.",
        "This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with cold and flu symptoms. Eligible participants with at least moderate common cold or flu symptoms and symptom onset \u2264\u00a048 hours before screening were assigned to a single multiple-active-ingredient tablet (containing paracetamol, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, and chlorpheniramine maleate) or placebo tablet. Participants rated severity of each symptom (sore throat, headache, extremity pain, nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, and cough) from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) at 15 and 30\u00a0minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 4\u00a0hours post administration. The total symptom score (TSS) was calculated as the sum of the individual symptom scores (primary endpoint). Participants rated global response to treatment on a scale from 0 (ineffective) to 4 (excellent). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout.",
        "Of 53 participants randomized, 52 received active tablet (n\u00a0=\u00a025) or placebo tablet (n\u00a0=\u00a027). Change from baseline in TSS throughout the 4-hour post-administration period was similar between groups. An efficacy criterion of 30% decrease in TSS at assessment points was not met (range, -1.91 to 8.94%). There were also no significant differences between groups in mean symptom scores for individual symptoms or global response to treatment. Four non-serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred.",
        "In this exploratory pilot study, a multisymptom cold and flu tablet was well tolerated but did not differ from placebo tablet with regard to onset of action following a single dose.\u2029."
