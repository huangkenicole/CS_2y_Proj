        "The northern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne hapla, is one of the most important nematode pathogens occurring in cold regions. It is a sedentary, biotrophic parasites of plants and overwinter in the soil or in diseased roots. This study showed that the cold tolerance for the second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. hapla was moderate with the 50% survival temperature (S50) of -2.22\u00b0C and the fatal temperature was -6\u00b0C when cooling at 0.5\u00b0C min-1. Cryoprotective dehydration significantly enhance cold tolerance of M. hapla J2 with the lowest S50 of -3.28\u00b0C after held being at -1\u00b0C for 6 h. Moreover, cold shock and cold acclimation had significant effects on the freezing survival of M. hapla J2. The lethal temperature of eggs was -18\u00b0C. Therefore, the cold tolerance of M. hapla is sufficiently favorable to withstand winters in cold temperature environments."
