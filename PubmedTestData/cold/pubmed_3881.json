      "AbstractText": [
        "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal pirodavir in naturally occurring rhinovirus colds. Adults with symptoms of < or = 2 days' duration were randomly assigned to intranasal sprays of pirodavir (2 mg per treatment) or placebo six times daily for 5 days. In people with laboratory-documented rhinovirus colds (53 in the pirodavir group, 55 in the placebo group), no significant differences in the resolution of respiratory symptoms were apparent between the groups. The median duration of illness was 7 days in each group. Similarly, scores for individual symptoms found no differences in favor of pirodavir during or after treatment. In contrast, reduced frequencies of rhinovirus shedding were observed in the pirodavir group on day 3 (70 versus 23%; P < 0.001) and day 5 (38 versus 12%; P = 0.002) but not after the cessation of treatment, on day 7 (19 versus 21%). No pirodavir-resistant viruses were recovered from treated individuals. The pirodavir group had higher rates of nasal dryness, blood in mucus, or unpleasant taste on several study days. In summary, intranasal sprays of pirodavir were associated with significant antiviral effects but no clinical benefit in treating naturally occurring rhinovirus colds."
