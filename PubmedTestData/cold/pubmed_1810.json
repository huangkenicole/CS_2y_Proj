        "Viral infection of the respiratory tract in patients with asthma is one of the most frequent causes of exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms. Disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) is a commonly used anti-asthmatic medicine with many beneficial biochemical and physiological effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of DSCG against colds when used in clinical practice.",
        "A questionnaire survey to determine the efficacy of DSCG was undertaken in 220 adult patients with asthma (81 male, 139 female; mean age: 54.1 +/- 13.7 years and 60.1 +/- 12.7 years, respectively) from April to September 2004 at the Miyatake Asthma Clinic.",
        "The duration of DSCG inhalation therapy was not less than 5 years in more than half of the patients. The mean daily DSCG dose at the time of the questionnaire survey was 40mg/day in over 50% of all patients. After DSCG was added to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combination therapy, 56.4% of the patients rated their condition as \"improved\", and 66.4% of the patients felt that the frequency of colds they had caught had decreased while DSCG was added to ICS.",
        "DSCG inhalation therapy is a useful additional treatment following ICS to alleviate asthma symptoms, and to prevent colds in adult patients with asthma."
