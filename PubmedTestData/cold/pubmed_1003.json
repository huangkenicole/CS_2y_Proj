        "Dietary supplements have been suggested in the prevention of the common cold, but previous investigations have been inconsistent. The present study was designed to determine the preventive effect of a dietary supplement from fruits and vegetables on common cold symptoms. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthcare professionals (mainly nursing staff aged 18-65 years) from a university hospital in Berlin, Germany, were randomised to four capsules of dietary supplement (Juice Plus+\u00ae) or matching placebo daily for 8 months, including a 2-month run-in period. The number of days with moderate or severe common cold symptoms within 6 months (primary outcome) was assessed by diary self-reports. We determined means and 95\u00a0% CI, and differences between the two groups were analysed by ANOVA. A total of 529 subjects were included into the primary analysis (Juice Plus+\u00ae: 263, placebo: 266). The mean age of the participants was 39\u00b79 (sd 10\u00b73) years, and 80\u00a0% of the participants were female. The mean number of days with moderate or severe common cold symptoms was 7\u00b76 (95\u00a0% CI 6\u00b75, 8\u00b78) in the Juice Plus+\u00ae group and 9\u00b75 (8\u00b74, 10\u00b76) in the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7023). The mean number of total days with any common cold symptoms was similar in the Juice Plus+\u00ae and in the placebo groups (29\u00b74 (25\u00b78, 33\u00b70) v. 30\u00b77 (27\u00b71, 34\u00b73), P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7616). Intake of a dietary supplement from fruits and vegetables was associated with a 20\u00a0% reduction of moderate or severe common cold symptom days in healthcare professionals particularly exposed to patient contact."
