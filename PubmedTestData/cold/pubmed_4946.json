        "The aim of this study was to determine the length of stages (appraisal, illness, behavioral, and scheduling) of patient delay in patients with head and neck cancer and to find out whether these delays were related to the stage of the disease at diagnosis.",
        "Before treatment, 117 newly diagnosed patients with laryngeal cancer were interviewed about their prediagnostic period. To determine the length of the different stages of patient delay, patients were asked about their symptoms, attributions of symptoms, and reasons to postpone medical consultation. A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner and to a close relative to verify their answers.",
        "There was no significant difference in the length of patient delay between early- (T1-T2) and advanced- stage (T3-T4) disease (9 vs 5 weeks; p = .07). Only tumor site was significantly associated with patient delay. The median total patient delays for glottic and supraglottic tumors were 10 and 4 weeks, respectively (p = .00). Hoarseness/voice change was the most commonly mentioned symptom. Patients attributed their symptom most frequently to a common cold/infection or had no idea about the cause. Medical attention was postponed because symptoms were interpreted as innocuous/benign or the symptom was thought not to be serious enough. The main reason to visit the general practitioner was persistent hoarseness. Behavioral and scheduling delays were of minor importance.",
        "Patient delay was significantly longer in cases of glottic cancer, but diagnosis at an early stage of the disease was more frequent among these patients than among patients with supraglottic cancer. Advanced supraglottic cancer probably has a late onset of symptoms. Thus, earlier intervention will probably not result in a significantly higher proportion of small supraglottic cancers being diagnosed."
