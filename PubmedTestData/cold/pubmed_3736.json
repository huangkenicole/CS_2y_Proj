        "Respiratory illnesses are the commonest cause of patient visits to physicians. Although the common cold, sinusitis and bronchitis may be lacking in drama, they account for a substantial amount of morbidity among women of reproductive age and are frequently encountered by physicians caring for pregnant women. Present knowledge about the management of these common conditions and the safety of the medications often used to treat them are reviewed in this chapter. Asthma and community-acquired pneumonia are more serious respiratory illnesses that are also often encountered in pregnancy. Present evidence suggests that community-acquired pneumonia is best treated empirically, with additional investigation usually necessary only if there is a failure of initial treatment. The recognition of asthma as an inflammatory condition has led to a very specific approach to its management that can readily and safely be applied to the pregnant woman. Treatment of HIV and tuberculosis should not be withheld during pregnancy because of the life-threatening nature of these infections and the importance of preventing vertical transmission."
