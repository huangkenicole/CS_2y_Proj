        "To establish the guidelines on common cold treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in terms of pattern identification.",
        "The guidelines were formulated by using the basic patterns common cold in China Pharmacopeia integrated with findings from systematic literature review and the experts' consensus on the issue in question.",
        "Common cold was divided into four patterns in the guidelines. The medications were recommended respectively: Ganmaoqingre granule for wind-cold exterior syndrome, Yinqiaojiedu granule for wind-heat exterior syndrome, Huoxiangzhengqi Wan for summer-heat dampness exterior syndrome and Shensu Wan for wind-cold exterior syndrome accompanied with Qi deficiency.",
        "The guidelines were primarily derived from the practice experience of TCM and the experts' consensus. The process was not strictly evidence-based because of lacking enough clinical studies. Further refinement of the guidelines should be needed as more studies are available."
