        "Perception of the common cold and other discomforts was studied as a function fo age among 456 normals ranging in age from 18 to 82. Respondents completed a questionnaire which deal with the frequency and duration of their colds, their symptoms and treatments-and, finally, with the perceived severity of various discomforts. Though older Rs were found to suffer more than younger with body aches, the former had less difficulty with a variety of other physical and psychological symptoms-and also contracted relatively few colds. Older Rs treated their colds less often with Contac and Dristan, but more often by staying home and/or calling their doctor. As compared with younger Rs, older respondents perceived intestinal flu to be relatively less serious-but earache, sprained toe, indigestion, having a tooth filled, stiff neck, and hangover to be relatively more serious."
