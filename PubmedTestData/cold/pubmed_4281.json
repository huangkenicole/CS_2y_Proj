        "Genetic mechanisms of species local adaptation are an emerging topic of great interest in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology. In this study, we compared the changes of physiological and phenotypic indexes and gene expression of four weeping forsythia populations under cold stress through a common garden experiment. Physiological and phenotypic results showed that there were differences in cold tolerance among populations. cold tolerance of high the latitude population (HBWZ) was the strongest, followed by the middle latitude population (SXWL), while the low latitude populations (SXHM) and (SXLJ) expressed the weakest cold tolerance. We identified significant differences in gene expression of cold tolerance related pathways and ontologies, including genes of oxylipin and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic process, galactose, tyrosine and unsaturated fatty acids metabolism, among these populations under the same experimental temperature treatments. Even under the same degree of stress, there were notable differences in gene expression among natural populations. In this study, we present a working model of weeping forsythia populations which evolved in the context of different intensities of cold stress. Our study provides new insights for comprehending the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation for non-model species."
