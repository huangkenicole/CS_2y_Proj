        "Try to find out asthma incidence in urban population of Shenyang.",
        "From December 1998 to June 1999, 24 176 residents (11 955 male and 12 221 female persons) living in two residential districts from an industrial and a cultural region were selected as subjects of epidemic investigation by random sampling. The subjects were asked questions concerning the epidemic investigation. The lung functions were measured for subjects suspicious for asthma.",
        "299 cases (102 male and 197 female) were diagnosed as asthma. The incidence of asthma was 1.24% (male 0.85% and female 1.61%). The female incidence of asthma was significantly higher than that in male (P < 0.01). Of the asthma patients, 80 cases (26.76%) were found with heredity background in their families; and 73 cases (24.41%) were found complicated with COPD.",
        "The investigation basically reflected the true condition of asthma incidence in urban population of Shenyang."
