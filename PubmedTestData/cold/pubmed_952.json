        "Human rhinoviruses are the major causative agents of the common cold. Because there are greater than 100 viral serotypes, little immunological protection is afforded to humans by prior rhinovirus exposure, which accounts for the high incidence of infection. In most cases, rhinovirus leads to a short self-limiting illness. However, for asthmatics, the elderly and immunocompromised patients, rhinovirus infection can lead to life-threatening complications. This has spurred a consistent effort over recent decades to identify effective treatments and preventions for rhinovirus infection. While some work has focused on alleviating the symptoms induced as a result of inflammatory pathways stimulated by rhinoviruses, the majority of the research has been focused on limiting or preventing viral infection altogether. Various approaches have been taken to halt rhinovirus infection. Prevention of virus-cell interaction has been the aim of research on viral capsid binders and cell receptor blockers. Interference with correct viral protein processing is the goal of the design and testing of protease inhibitors. Current work is attempting to interfere with viral RNA replication by testing silencing RNA molecules. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the development and testing of human rhinovirus therapeutics."
