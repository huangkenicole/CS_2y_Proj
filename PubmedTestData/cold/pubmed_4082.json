        "Ecstasy, the popular name for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is a synthetic amphetamine derivative. It stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, producing serious adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. We present a 20-year-old female patient, who developed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and death following MDMA and coingestion with other drugs. She suffered from severe headache followed by vomiting, and conscious change 5 hours after an intake of 1 tablet MDMA and other drugs at a dance club. Her blood pressure was 226/164 mmHg, pulse rate 164/min, respiratory rate 30/min on arrival at our emergency department. Diffuse rales were heard over both lung fields. Both pupils' sizes were 4 mm, with sluggish reaction to light. A 12 lead electrocardiograph showed sinus tachycardia, ST depression in the inferior leads and V4 to V6 precordial leads. Laboratory findings revealed normal except a slightly raised white cell count and glucose. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH was 7.333, with PaCO2 24.6 mmHg, PaO2 151.7 mmHg and HCO3 12.8 mmol/L. Chest x-ray revealed acute pulmonary edema. Urgent computerized tomography scanning of the head demonstrated SAH. Her condition continued to deteriorate, and went to deep coma and shock status. She expired on the second day although we treated aggressively."
