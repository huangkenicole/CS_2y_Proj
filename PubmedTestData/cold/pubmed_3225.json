        "A student peer-taught program, to decrease antibiotic use for colds and flu, was developed and implemented in one school district (21 schools) in Chisinau, Moldova, in 2003-04. A second district (20 schools) served as the control (C). Students (12-13 years) and adults most responsible for the family's health care completed surveys in March pre-post intervention. The surveys determined the reported incidence of colds and flu during the past winter, treatment, beliefs about cause and usefulness of antibiotics. The intervention included peer-education sessions, parents' meetings, booklet, vignette video, newsletters, poster and poster contest. The intervention also provided basic information on appropriate use of medicines. Pre-post intervention survey results indicated that the intervention was successful. Adjusted for Cs, students who reported they did not treat colds or flu with antibiotics increased 33.7%; the comparable increase for adults was 38.0%. Adjusted for Cs, intervention students who did not know if they had used an antibiotic decreased 15.1% and for intervention adults the comparable decrease was 5.0%. All relative responses related to beliefs about the cause of colds and flu and the usefulness of antibiotics to treat them changed in a positive direction. In all groups, beliefs and behaviors relative to antibiotic use were related."
