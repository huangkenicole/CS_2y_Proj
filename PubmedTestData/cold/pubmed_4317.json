        "Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against three distinct antigenic sites on rhinovirus type 2 have been obtained and the sites identified. We describe how these MAbs were used in a blocking test to detect antibodies in human sera directed against the same three defined sites. Sera from twelve volunteers were studied. All had been exposed to rhinovirus type 2 by intranasal inoculation, four had been uninfected, eight were infected of whom four developed a cold while four did not. Blocking antibodies were high and did not increase in the resistant volunteers, and were lower and increased in the infected volunteers. The antibodies were almost as sensitive as other antibody assays for detecting infection. The responses to all three sites were similar. Correlations between the results of all tests were calculated and the results are summarised. Tests were also devised to measure the Ig subclass of antibodies against the whole virus particle. The A1, G1, and G4 classes showed most frequent rises in response to infection. Correlations between these results and other antibody assays were found and are presented."
