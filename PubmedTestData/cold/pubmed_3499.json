        "In recent years, the incidence of infantile repetitive respiratory infection has been increasing. In order to prevent and treat this disease, the authors suggest that pathogenesis of this disease is mainly due to insufficiency of Lung, Spleen and Kidney, which caused the Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis Syndrome, and thus formulated Yifei Jianshen Mixture (YFJSM). The clinical and experimental study was carried out accordingly. The results showed that this mixture could increase the immune function of human body, and improve microcirculation, and has the function of warming up Yang and replenishing Qi, nourishing blood and activating blood circulation and eventually of preventing and treating diseases. 305 cases were clinically observed, the total effective rate being 95.1%. The effect of treatment is obviously better than that of control using Yupingfeng powder (P < 0.01). The adrenocortical function, plasma nucleotide, immune function, microcirculation and others were the main technical indexes of models, which were nearly the same as clinical study. The toxicity test also showed that the YFJSM was non-toxic and had no side effect. The study proved that the mixture was highly effective and had no side effect."
