        "This study investigated whether short episodes of sickness absence were associated with job satisfaction.",
        "199 wage earners who reported sick due to the common cold between January 2003 and April 2003.",
        "Job satisfaction was assessed on the first day of sickness absence and associated with the duration of sickness absence using a multiple logistic regression model to which demographics, working conditions, and the week day on which sick-leave was taken were stepwise added as covariates.",
        "Workers with low job satisfaction scores had higher odds (odds ratio [OR] =3.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74 to 8.51) of being > 3 days absent from work due to the common cold compared to satisfied workers. However, the duration of sickness absence due to the common cold was more strongly related to the day of taking sick-leave with workers who reported sick on Monday or Tuesday being longer absent (OR=5.36; 95% CI 1.44 to 9.90) than those who reported sick on Friday.",
        "When having a common cold, dissatisfied workers are longer absent from work although the duration of short episodes of sickness absence seems to be determined by the week day on which sick-leave is taken rather than working conditions or perceptions about work."
