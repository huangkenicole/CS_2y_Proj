        "The time required to recover from cold exposure (chill coma recovery time) may represent an important metric of performance and has been linked to geographic distributions of diverse species. Chill coma recovery time (CCRT) has rarely been measured in bumble\u00a0bees (genus Bombus) but may provide insights regarding recent changes in their distributions. We measured CCRT of Bombus vosnesenskii workers reared in common garden laboratory conditions from queens collected across altitude and latitude in the Western United States. We also compared CCRTs of male and female bumble\u00a0bees because males are often overlooked in studies of bumble\u00a0bee ecology and physiology and may differ in their ability to respond to cold temperatures. We found no relationship between CCRT and local climate at the queen collection sites, but CCRT varied significantly with sex and body mass. Because differences in the ability to recover from cold temperatures have been shown in wild-caught Bombus, we predict that variability in CCRT may be strongly influenced by plasticity."
