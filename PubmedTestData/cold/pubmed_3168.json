        "Rhinovirus (RV) is an established trigger of asthma attacks, whereas such a link is less consistent for influenza virus (IFV).",
        "In the context of precision medicine, we hypothesized that IFV infection may cause a condition essentially different from RV, and we investigated this by evaluating clinical characteristics of RV/IFV-positive and -negative children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever.",
        "One thousand two hundred and seven children, 6 months to 13 years old, hospitalized for flu-like illness were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Collected information included demographics, medical history, symptoms/physical findings/diagnosis at presentation and treatment. Nasal secretions were PCR-tested for IFV/RV. Associations were evaluated with adjusted logistic regression models.",
        "Rhinovirus positivity was associated with an asthma-like presentation, including increased wheeze/effort of breathing/diagnosis of acute asthma, and decreased fever/vomiting. Conversely, IFV<sup>+</sup> children presented with less wheeze/effort of breathing/diagnosis of acute asthma, while they were more frequently febrile. In those with previous asthma history, both viruses induced wheeze; however, IFV was uniquely associated with a more generalised and severe presentation including fever, rales, intercostal muscle retractions and lymphadenopathy. These symptoms were not seen in RV<sup>+</sup> asthmatics, who had fewer systemic signs and more cough.",
        "In children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever, RV but not IFV is associated with wheeze and an asthma-like presentation. In those with an asthma history, IFV causes more generalised and severe disease that may be better described as \"asthma-augmented influenza\" rather than an \"asthma attack.\" Differences in the acute conditions caused by these viruses should be considered in the design of epidemiological studies."
