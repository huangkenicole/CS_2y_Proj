        "Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Over the last decade, studies using new molecular diagnostic techniques have established that respiratory viruses are a major cause of exacerbations of both asthma and COPD. The most prevalent viruses detected during exacerbations are the rhinoviruses. Despite the burden of disease associated with exacerbations, little is known about the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of airway diseases. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation in patients with both asthma and COPD, but many questions remain unanswered regarding the key inflammatory cells and mediators involved. Identifying the key inflammatory mediators involved in exacerbations holds the promise of developing diagnostic and prognostic markers of exacerbation. In addition, such studies can identify new therapeutic targets for the development of novel drugs for the prevention and treatment of exacerbations."
