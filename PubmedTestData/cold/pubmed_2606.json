        "Kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) is\u00a0commonly used for treating uncomplicated Upper Respiratory Tract\u00a0Infection (URTI) in complementary and alternative system of medicine. AP-Bio\u00ae(KalmCold\u00ae) is a standardized extract derived from the leaves of A. paniculata. This study was proposed to evaluate its efficacy using validated scales and objective measures.",
        "Participants were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either AP-Bio\u00ae 200\u00a0mg/day, AP-Bio\u00ae 400\u00a0mg/day or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome measure was Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21) score. The secondary outcome measures were nasal mucous weight, nasal muco-ciliary clearance function and Interleukin-8 in nasal wash, as well as safety and tolerability.",
        "A total of n\u00a0=\u00a0331 participants were screened and N\u00a0=\u00a0300 participants were enrolled. The absolute WURSS-21 global score [mean (Standard Deviation - SD)] in the AP-Bio\u00ae 400\u00a0mg group [5.70 (5.31)] was less than the AP-Bio\u00ae 200\u00a0mg group [5.81 (4.83)] on Day-3. However, it was much higher in the placebo group [9.55 (14.27)]. AP-Bio\u00ae 400\u00a0mg group (Mean Difference - MD [Standard Error - SE] = -3.85 [1.52]; 95% CI = -6.85, - 0.85; adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and 200\u00a0mg group (MD [SE] = -3.74 [1.51]; 95% CI = -6.73, - 0.76; adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) had significantly lower score than placebo. Similarly, on Day-3, the change in global score from baseline was significantly better in the AP-Bio\u00ae 400\u00a0mg group (MD [SE] = -3.91; [1.82] 95% CI = -7.50, - 0.32; adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and AP-Bio\u00ae 200\u00a0mg group (MD [SE] = -3.84 [1.97]; 95% CI = -7.72, - 0.04; adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.044) in comparison to the placebo group. Nasal mucous weight, tissue paper counts used, and interleukin-8 showed a trend towards AP-Bio\u00ae\u00a0groups having a favourable outcome when compared with placebo but did not reach statistical significance due to a small sample size. None of the study participants complained of any adverse physical symptoms. However, incident eosinophilia was noted in n\u00a0=\u00a020 participants on day 3. (n\u00a0=\u00a06 in AP-Bio\u00ae 200\u00a0mg group, n\u00a0=\u00a07 in Ap-Bio\u00ae 400\u00a0mg group and n\u00a0=\u00a013 in placebo group; p\u00a0=\u00a00.181).",
        "Participants in both the AP-Bio\u00ae\u00a0dose groups showed positive tendency towards resolution of URTI symptoms when compared with placebo on Day-3 but not on Day-5 and Day-7."
