        "Sinusitis is usually considered a complication of viral rhinitis. Virus infections in the upper respiratory tract lead to mucosal swelling, which may obstruct paranasal sinus outflow, resulting in infection in the paranasal sinuses. Topical nasal steroids have been found beneficial in a variety of acute and chronic nasal conditions including allergic and nonallergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the intranasal inhalation powder beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 400 micrograms/day treatment has a beneficial or harmful effect on symptoms and signs of common cold, and whether or not it can prevent common cold complications. A total of 54 patients were randomized, 26 into the placebo-group and 28 into the BDP group. During the 14-day follow-up, there were on an average 10.3 symptomatic days in the placebo group and 10.7 days in the BDP group (p = 0.72). The use of intranasal BDP in the treatment of common cold neither reduced symptoms caused by inflammation nor did it shorten the recovery time. On the other hand, because BDP does not increase the risk of complications or significantly prolong the recovery during the common cold, there is no need to discontinue its use in the patients with allergic rhinitis or nasal polyposis."
