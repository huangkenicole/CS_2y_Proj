        "Low temperature is a limiting factor for crop productivity in tropical and subtropical climates. Cold stress response in plants involves perceiving and relaying the signal through a transcriptional cascade composed of different transduction components, resulting in altered gene activity. We performed a meta-analysis of four previously published datasets of cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive crops to better understand the gene regulatory networks and identify key genes involved in cold stress tolerance conserved across phylogenetically distant species. Re-analysing the raw data with the same bioinformatics pipeline, we identified common cold tolerance-related genes. We found 236 and 242 commonly regulated genes in sensitive and tolerant genotypes, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis showed that protein modifications, hormone metabolism, cell wall, and secondary metabolism are the most conserved pathways involved in cold tolerance. Upregulation of the abiotic stress (heat and drought/salt) related genes [heat shock N -terminal domain-containing protein, 15.7kDa class I-related small heat shock protein-like, DNAJ heat shock N -terminal domain-containing protein, and HYP1 (HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN 1)] in sensitive genotypes and downregulation of the abiotic stress (heat and drought/salt) related genes (zinc ion binding and pollen Ole e 1 allergen and extensin family protein) in tolerant genotypes was observed across the species. Almost all development-related genes were upregulated in tolerant and downregulated in sensitive genotypes. Moreover, protein-protein network analysis identified highly interacting proteins linked to cold tolerance. Mapping of abiotic stress-related genes on analysed species genomes provided information that could be essential to developing molecular markers for breeding and building up genetic improvement strategies using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies."
