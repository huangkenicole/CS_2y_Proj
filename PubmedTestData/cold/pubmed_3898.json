        "Over 1,300 children were studied in an analysis of factors that might affect pharyngeal colonization with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Our semiquantitative methods for the culture of H. influenzae type b, consisting of inoculation of 0.001 ml of throat swab fluid on antiserum agar plates and division of the results into three grades of intensity, showed agreement as to intensity of colonization in over 80% of repeat throat cultures. Our data also suggest that throat swabs are more efficient than nasopharyngeal swabs for detecting colonization, particularly for older children. All 17 H. influenzae type b carriers found with either method were detected with throat swabs, but six had negative nasopharyngeal cultures; four of these six were lightly colonized older children. Furthermore, colony counts were apt to be higher on plates inoculated with throat swab fluids. The frequency of pharyngeal H. influenzae type b colonization in children visiting health department clinics and pediatricians' offices was low during the first 6 months of life (0.7%) but averaged 3 to 5% throughout the rest of childhood. Approximately two-thirds of the carriers were colonized at an intensity too low to be detected by standard laboratory techniques. No influence on colonization rates was found for sex, race, season, economic status, or common childhood infectious diseases such as coryza or otitis media."
