        "We investigated whether perioperative respiratory complications increase in adults with common cold symptom.",
        "Thirty patients who had had a common cold (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneeze, cough, sputa, or fever) in two weeks before general anesthesia and other 30 patients without any symptoms were enrolled in this study. All the patients were anesthetized with intravenous or inhalation anesthetics and were intubated. The incidences of bronchospasm, laryngospasm, dry or moist rale on lung field, increase in sputa or cough, and fever were checked during and for 5 days after, surgery.",
        "More patients with common cold showed dry or moist rale, increase in sputa or cough, and fever than those without common cold. Even though these were not statistically significant, three severe complications, respiratory as well as cardiac arrest, pneumonia, and prolonged intubation due to increased sputa, were observed.",
        "General anesthesia with oro-tracheal intubation should be postponed at least two weeks after common cold in adults."
