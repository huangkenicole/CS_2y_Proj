        "Young children with rhinovirus (RV) infection-particularly bronchiolitis-are at high risk for developing childhood asthma. Emerging evidence suggests clinical heterogeneity within RV bronchiolitis. However, little is known about these biologically distinct subgroups (endotypes) and their relations with asthma risk.",
        "We aimed to identify RV bronchiolitis endotypes and examine their longitudinal relations with asthma risk.",
        "As part of a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants (age <12 months) hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we integrated clinical, RV species (RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C), nasopharyngeal microbiome (16S rRNA gene sequencing), cytokine, and metabolome (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) data collected at hospitalization. We then applied network and clustering approaches to identify bronchiolitis endotypes. We also examined their longitudinal association with risks of developing recurrent wheeze by age 3 years and asthma by age 5 years.",
        "Of 122 infants hospitalized for RV bronchiolitis (median age, 4 months), we identified 4 distinct endotypes-mainly characterized by RV species, microbiome, and type 2 cytokine (T2) response: endotype A, virus<sup>RV-C</sup>microbiome<sup>mixed</sup>T2<sup>low</sup>; endotype B, virus<sup>RV-A</sup>microbiome<sup>Haemophilus</sup>T2<sup>low</sup>; endotype C, virus<sup>RSV/RV</sup>microbiome<sup>Streptococcus</sup>T2<sup>low</sup>; and endotype D, virus<sup>RV-C</sup>microbiome<sup>Moraxella</sup>T2<sup>high</sup>. Compared with endotype A\u00a0infants, endotype D infants had a significantly higher rate of recurrent wheeze (33% vs 64%; hazard ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.00-4.96; P\u00a0= .049) and a higher risk for developing asthma (28% vs 59%; odds ratio, 3.74: 95% CI, 1.21-12.6; P\u00a0= .03).",
        "Integrated-omics analysis identified biologically meaningful RV bronchiolitis endotypes in infants, such as one characterized by RV-C infection, Moraxella-dominant microbiota, and high T2 cytokine response, at higher risk for developing recurrent wheeze and asthma. This study should\u00a0facilitate further research toward validating our inferences."
