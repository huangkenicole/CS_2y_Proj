        "Adalia decempunctata (L.) is a common predator in agro ecosystems. Here, the effects of low-temperature storage on biological parameters, energy reserves, and antioxidant enzymes were investigated. Eggs, larvae, and pupae of this predator were maintained for 1-4\u00a0weeks and adults for different days (20, 35, 50, and 65 d) at 4, 7, and 10\u00a0\u00b0C in darkness and 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% R.H. After storage of 20\u00a0days, the survival rate in male and female insects was >90% in 4, 7, and 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C. In 65\u00a0days, the highest survival rate for adult insects was recorded at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Effect of cold storage on the performance of adult's A. decempunctata was not statistically different for periods up to 35\u00a0days, but decreased longer duration (65\u00a0days). The female adults were able to tolerate the cold storage period by producing higher amounts of glucose and antioxidant enzymes, thus displaying a high survival rate. Based on our results, maintaining A. decempunctata adults at low temperatures (i.e. 4, 7, and 10\u00a0\u00b0C) for 20 or 35\u00a0days performed best without loss of quality."
