        "To explore the therapeutic effect of acupuncture at Dazhui (GV 14) for abating fever of common cold.",
        "Two hundred and sixty-one cases were randomly assigned to a treatment group of 133 cases and a control group of 128 cases. The treatment group were treated with electroacupuncture at Dazhui (GV 14) and the control group with antondine injection. The transient effect of abating fever within 24 h was observed.",
        "After treatment, the body temperature at all observation time points in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The effect-appearing time (1.42 +/- 1.79) h in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group (3.44 +/- 5.10) h (P < 0.01). The cured rate and the abating fever rate were 27.8% and 75.9% in the treatment group, and 10.9% and 55.5% in the control group, with significant differences between the two groups, the treatment group being better than the control group (P < 0.01). The abating fever rate for the wind-heat type common cold was 75.3% in the treatment group and 50.0% in the control group, with significant difference between the two groups, the treatment group being better than the control group (P < 0.01).",
        "The method of acupuncture at Dazhui (GV 14) has a definite therapeutic effect on high fever of common cold, and for wind-heat type common cold, Dazhui (GV 14) first may be chosen to abate high-fever and the treatment should be taken as early as possible."
