        "The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a matter of great concern. Although the mortality rate caused by this virus is less than that of SARS and MERS, it is showing higher efficacy in terms of human-to-human transmission. Several strategies have been taken by scientists and researchers worldwide to combat this virus. Numerous phytochemicals and synthesized chemicals are under incessant inspection to obtain a potent anti-covid drug. Since, till now no precise therapy is available for covid patients, researchers are trying to categorize all possible anti-covid substances. Repurposing of drugs and combined drug therapy are becoming popular in treating such viral diseases. In this study, we are proposing the repurposing of three chemicals<b>-</b>Dextromethorphan, Prednisolone and Dexamethasone as anti-covid agents. We have used the tertiary structure of Coronavirus main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) with PDB ID 6LU7 as the target protein in this analysis. Molecular docking and dynamics study further revealed their synergistic effect against the COVID-19 protease protein.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
