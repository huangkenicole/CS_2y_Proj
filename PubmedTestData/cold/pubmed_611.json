        "We conducted a prospective observational study to determine the relationship between adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and susceptibility to the common cold in moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients.",
        "We prospectively investigated the number of days with common cold symptoms from November 2019 to February 2020. The rate of CPAP use for 4\u00a0h/night in the preceding four months (July to October 2019) was used as a measure of CPAP adherence. Multiple generalized linear models were used to evaluate the association to days of common cold symptoms after controlling for demographic variables, habitual short sleep duration, and insomnia severity.",
        "We included 123 outpatients (median age 63 years) with moderate-to-severe OSA treated with CPAP. In the multivariate generalized linear model, better CPAP adherence was independently significantly associated with days with fewer common cold symptoms (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.248, P\u00a0=\u00a00.031); meanwhile, the severity of insomnia and habitual short sleep duration was not significantly associated with it. Subgroup analyses revealed that the association between CPAP adherence and days with common cold symptoms was also significant in young to middle-aged (<65 years) participants (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.407, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). In contrast, the association was negligible in older (\u226565 years) participants.",
        "CPAP adherence may be protective against viral infections in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. This effect appears to be more pronounced in young to middle-aged patients with OSA."
