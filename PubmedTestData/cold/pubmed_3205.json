        "Here we report a case of eperisone hydrochloride-induced drug eruption. A twenty-three-year-old female suffering from the common cold, headache and arthralgia was administered eperisone hydrochloride with several drugs including loxoprofen sodium. Two hours after receiving the medications, she noticed erythema and edema in the hands, and then the eruption spread across the whole body. The patient was hospitalized and treated with a corticosteroid intravenously. An oral challenge test showed that eperisone hydrochloride was responsible for this drug eruption. There have been eighteen cases of drug eruption caused by eperisone hydrochloride in the literature and eight cases have shown urticaria/anaphylaxis types. Some cases took several hours to exhibit symptoms even for urticaria/anaphylaxis types that were confirmed to induce an immediate allergic reaction."
