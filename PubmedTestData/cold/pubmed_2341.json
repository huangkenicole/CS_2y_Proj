        "Cold and allergy remedies are one of the most confusing markets to consumers. There are several reasons why there is confusion among consumers when forced to select a cough/cold/allergy product. This paper examines the over-the-counter cold/cough/allergy products market specifically with respect to: (1) What are the common pharmaceutical active ingredients in cold/cough/allergy products? (2) What percentage of products are single ingredient, two ingredient, three ingredient or more? (3) What are the common combinations of pharmaceutical ingredients present in cold/cough/allergy products? The answers to the above questions could help health professionals such as pharmacists in rendering services such as counseling consumers when approached with questions about cold/cough/allergy products. The results could also help retailers in developing better shelf placement and positioning of cold/cough/allergy products."
