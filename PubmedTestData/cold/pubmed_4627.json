        "Drought, cold, and high salinity are three major abiotic stresses effecting apple tree growth and fruit production. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of crosstalk between stress responses signalling networks and identifying the genes involved in apple has potential importance for crop improvement and breeding strategies. Here, the transcriptome profiling analysis of in vitro-grown apple plants subjected to drought, cold and high salinity stress, showed a total of 377 upregulated and 211 downregulated common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to all 3 stress treatments compared with the control. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that these common DEGs were enriched in 'metabolic process' under the 'biological process' category, as well as in 'binding' and 'catalytic activity' under the 'molecular function' category. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that common DEGs were mainly belong to the 'biological functions' category and 17 DEGs were identified in 'environmental information processing' sub-category which may act as signal transduction components in response crosstalk regulation. Overexpression of 5 upregulated genes individually, out of these 17 common DEGs in apple calli promoted the consistent upregulation of DREB6, CBF1 and ZAT10 and increased the mass weight and antioxidase ability, implying these five common DEGs involved in multiple pathways and improved comprehensive resistance to stress."
