        "A prospective study of respiratory infections was performed in nineteen married asthmatics and their normal spouses who were examined at monthly intervals during a 1-year period. The colds described were associated with nasal symptoms, sore throat and usually malaise, fever, cough and hoarseness. The asthamtics reported a larger number of these symptomatic episodes than the non-asthmatics but significantly fewer of the episodes in the asthmatics were objectively confirmed by viral isolation or rise in serum titre of viral antibody. The frequency of respiratory infections was not influenced by the long term use of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and oral corticosteroid drugs. Less than 10% of the exacerbations of asthma were associated with respiratory infection. The disability resulting from respiratory infections in the asthmatics did not significantly exceed that in the non-asthmatics."
