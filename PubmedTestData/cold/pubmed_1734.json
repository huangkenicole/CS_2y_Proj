        "Take special care when recommending a product to people with a pre-existing medical condition (e.g., high blood pressure, stomach problems, asthma). It is safer to advise them to consult their pharmacist or doctor if there is a possibility of adverse drug interaction. Be aware of the possibility of overdosage (e.g., some patients take a large number of remedies simultaneously and may unwittingly be taking too much paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen). Green or yellow sputum suggests the patient has a bacterial infection in addition to a cold, and consulting a doctor is advisable. Enquire whether a cough is productive (\"loose\" or \"chesty\") or non-productive \"dry, \"tricky\" or \"irritating\") so that you can advise on appropriate product. Productive coughs are helped by expectorants. Dry coughs are helped by suppressants. Cough preparations often contain antihistamine which may cause drowsiness, so be aware of this when advising a patient. For young children a paediatric formulation is advisable. Many of the main brands of cough and cold medicines have infant or junior varieties. Vapour products, often using substances like menthol placed on a tissue near the child but out of reach, can be very effective for blocked noses. Sugar-free preparations should be used for children (and adults) where possible, to avoid the risk of tooth decay. If patients suffer from repeated colds and coughs, and complain of feeling \"run down\", questioning may reveal that they have a poor diet. In that case, recommending a vitamin supplement or tonic and advice on a healthier diet may be appropriate. A persistent cough should receive medical attention."
