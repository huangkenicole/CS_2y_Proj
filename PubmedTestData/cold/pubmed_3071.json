        "Nasal airway resistance (NAR) is normally asymmetrical due to the nasal cycle. The aims of this study were to determine the degree of this asymmetry in healthy subjects and those with acute rhinitis associated with common cold, and to investigate how the administration of a topical nasal decongestant (xylometazoline) influenced the asymmetry in NAR. Unilateral NAR was measured by active anterior rhinomanometry, and was shown to be asymmetrical in both healthy subjects and those suffering with acute rhinitis. The asymmetry in NAR was greater in those with acute rhinitis than in the healthy group, with a ratio between \"high\" and \"low\" sides of 2.3:1 in the rhinitis group compared to a ratio of 1.7:1 in the healthy subjects. Administration of a topical nasal decongestant caused a significant decrease in total NAR in both groups and abolished the asymmetry in NAR in the healthy subjects (ratio is 1:1 after decongestion). However, significant asymmetry of NAR was still present in the group with acute rhinitis following the administration of decongestant (ratio is 1.5:1 after decongestion). These findings show that the normal asymmetry in NAR was increased during acute rhinitis associated with common cold, and that in healthy subjects (but not in those with rhinitis) the asymmetry was abolished by administration of a topical decongestant. The results are discussed in relation to nasal sympathetic tone and nasal blood flow."
