        "The purpose was to explore the potential effects of nonapnea sleep disorders (NSDs) and hypnotic use on the incidence of common cold. This study adapted population-based retrospective cohort study designed. We used the data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1998 and 2011. In total, 59,476 patients with NSDs were included in the study cohort, and the reference cohort comprised 59,476 propensity score-matched patients. We conducted a Poisson regression analysis to assess the incidence of common cold. The overall incidence of common cold was significantly higher than that in the reference cohort. Compared with the patients of the reference cohort without hypnotic use, those of the NSDs cohort with benzodiazepines and zolpidem use had higher incidence of common cold. In conclusion, study cohort had a higher incidence of developing common cold, and particularly pronounced in NSDs with hypnotic use."
