        "With the expanding knowledge of rhinovirus transmission and rhinovirus chemistry, the outlook for control of infections with these agents has brightened considerably. Although rhinoviruses are probably the world's leading cause of respiratory illness, they are surprisingly reluctant transmitters, infecting only about 50% of susceptibles in family-like settings. Current research suggests that rhinoviruses are spread chiefly by aerosol, rather than by fomites or personal contact. It has been possible to interrupt rhinovirus transmission completely by careful use of virucidal facial tissues, which, presumably, smothered aerosols generated by coughing, sneezing and nose blowing. Accordingly, it may be feasible to control rhinovirus (and perhaps other virus) dissemination by appropriate air handling and filtration systems in combination with careful nasal sanitation. Anti-rhinovirus drug development is also moving forward. Although there are over 100 rhinovirus serotypes, it has been found that most rhinoviruses attach to a single cell receptor by a single binding site on the virus. Also, the structure of the rhinovirus capsid is now known at the atomic level. These two pieces of knowledge about basic viral architecture appear to open new vistas for reasoned synthesis of antiviral drugs, and some promising compounds are now under investigation. Even interferon has been demonstrated useful in a family setting. On several research fronts, there are good grounds for optimism about control of rhinovirus colds."
