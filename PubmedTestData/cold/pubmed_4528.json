      "AbstractText": [
        "A combination of paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, chlorpheniramine, and sodium benzoate in (Cold-Flu) 1,2,3 Syrup dosage form is specified for the treatment of common cold and flu symptoms.",
        "The functional role of this study is to develop a novel, reliable, and selective stability-indicating reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for simultaneous identification of a quaternary mixture of paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, chlorpheniramine, and sodium benzoate in (Cold-Flu) 1,2,3 Syrup dosage form.",
        "The specific method is accomplished using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 C18 column (2.1\u2009mm \u00d7 100\u2009mm), 1.8\u2009\u00b5m particle size with pore size 100\u2009\u00c5, utilizing a mixture of purified water-methanol-trifluoroacetic acid (72.5:27.5:1.5, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3\u2009mL/min. The column void volume is 1.15\u2009min. UPLC detection is adjusted at 205 nm using a photodiode array detector.",
        "Calibration curves are obtained in the linearity ranges: 25-500\u2009\u00b5g/mL for paracetamol, 10-50\u2009\u00b5g/mL for pseudoephedrine, 0.5-5\u2009\u00b5g/mL for chlorpheniramine, and 3-30\u2009\u00b5g/mL for sodium benzoate with a correlation coefficient > 0.9992. The mean recovery of the developed method is tested and shows good recovery results between 99-101%; selectivity and forced degradation studies are investigated as per the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines and no interference is detected due to degradation peaks.",
        "The proposed stability-indicating UPLC method for simultaneous determination of the three drugs, paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, and chlorpheniramine, with a preservative sodium benzoate in (Cold-Flu) 1,2,3 Syrup dosage form is successfully accomplished, developed, and validated, and can be easily used in the analysis of drugs in pure or dosage form.",
        "The novelty of the current research work lies in the development of the UPLC method for simultaneous determination of a quaternary mixture of paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, chlorpheniramine, and sodium benzoate in (Cold-Flu) 1,2,3 Syrup dosage form."
