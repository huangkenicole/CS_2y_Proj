      "AbstractText": [
        "A 35-year-old man was found dead by his wife. He was reported to have had symptoms of a common cold the week preceding his death. The medicolegal autopsy yielded signs of central dysregulation (ectasia of the urinary bladder and rectum, dystelectasis of the lungs) together with marked brain edema and fresh bite marks on the tongue. The cause of death was presumed to be lethal epileptic seizure. Neuropathologic examination revealed neuronal nodular heterotopia as well as discrete lymphocytic meningitis (aseptic meningitis). The death was most probably caused by the combination of the meningitis with the occult malformation, leading to a lowered seizure threshold and subsequent lethal seizure. The morphologic findings of this case are presented, and the probable mechanisms of death are discussed."
