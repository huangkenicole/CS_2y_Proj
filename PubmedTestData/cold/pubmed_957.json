        "The human rhinoviruses are the leading cause of the ubiquitous, mild, and self-limiting infections generally referred to as the common cold. Considerable research effort has been expended in the search for well tolerated antiviral agents capable of preventing and treating the common cold. Although no antirhinovirus drug is yet commercially available, considerable progress has been made in the discovery and development of novel, viral specific inhibitors of rhinovirus replication. This report reviews the history and current status of the research that has focused on inhibitors of the early steps in the virus life cycle: attachment to the cellular receptor and uncoating of the viral RNA. Molecules directed at these targets currently possess the greatest potential for generating a safe and efficacious treatment for the rhinovirus common cold."
