        "The combination of a regular daily supplement of vitamin C with extra dosage at the time of illness has been shown to reduce the disability due to common colds and other winter illness, but we have seen little effect on frequency of infections, sense of (well-being), or levels of serum cholesterol. The variable results that have been obtained from some other trials of vitamin C may be due in part to variation in the initial nutritional state of the subjects, with the greatest effects to be expected where there is most room for improvement. Because of the great variation in individual susceptibility to infection large numbers of subjects are required in these trials and they must be strictly double-blind. Although we have seen no clear evidence of harmful side-effects, occasional sensitivity to large doses of vitamin C cannot be ruled out, and the withdrawal depression of blood levels could conceivably interfere with a patient's ability to handle stress."
