        "Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is seen in the extremities during exposure to cold. A strong vasodilation response has been associated with a decreased risk of cold injury. Increasing CIVD might further decrease this risk. The calcium-channel blocker nifedipine causes vasodilation and is used to treat Raynaud's syndrome and chilblains. Nifedipine is also used for high altitude pulmonary edema and could potentially serve a dual purpose in preventing frostbite. The effects of nifedipine on CIVD have not been studied.",
        "A double-blind crossover study comparing nifedipine (30 mg SR (sustained release) orally\u00a0twice daily) to placebo was designed using 2 sessions of 4 finger immersion in 5\u00b0C water, with 24\u00a0h of medication pretreatment before each session. Finger temperatures were measured via nailbed thermocouples. The primary outcome was mean finger temperature; secondary outcomes were mean apex and nadir temperatures, first apex and nadir temperatures, subjective pain ranking, and time of vasodilation onset (all presented as mean\u00b1SD).",
        "Twelve volunteers (age 29\u00b13 [24-34] y) completed the study. No significant difference in finger temperature (9.2\u00b11.1\u00b0C nifedipine vs 9.0\u00b10.7\u00b0C placebo, P=0.38) or any secondary outcome was found. Pain levels were similar (2.8\u00b11.6 nifedipine vs 3.0\u00b11.5 placebo, P=0.32). The most common adverse event was headache (32% of nifedipine trials vs 8% placebo).",
        "Pretreatment with 30 mg of oral nifedipine twice daily does not affect the CIVD response in healthy individuals under cold stress."
