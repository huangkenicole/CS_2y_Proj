        "Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are parts of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) with certain gene function.It provides us more information than other neutral markers. The association of EST markers with phenotypes can increase our understanding of the biochemical pathways and mechanisms affecting economically important traits. In this study, 12 candidate EST markers isolated from the cold-induced brain cDNA of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were conducted the correlation analysis of marker and cold tolerance trait of common carp using GLM model of SPSS 17.0 software firstly, then tried to locate them in the genetic linkage map using OneMap software. As a result, eight out of 12 candidate EST makers were separately located in six linkage groups, in which marker CC009(P<0.05) and CC115 (P<0.01) were associated with cold tolerance and mapped to LG38 and LG2, respectively. Homology identity alignments showed that marker CC009 was highly homologous to the known Uridine-cytidine kinase I of Danio rerio with an identity of 94%, and marker CC115 was lowly homologous to the putative glycosyl transferase of Prochlorococcus marinus with an identity of 56%."
