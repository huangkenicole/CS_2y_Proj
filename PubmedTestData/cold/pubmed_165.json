        "To investigate the cognition of the common cold and current situation of the treatment among physicians from various levels of hospitals in Chinese mainland, so as to provide evidence for future continuing medical education and rational medication.",
        "A questionnaire designed for this survey was used to learn about the general information, cognitive degree of the common cold and prescription habits of physician who prescribed for cold within last three months, from various levels hospitals.",
        "A total of 1001 physicians were interviewed. Among them, 749 physicians chose right options that the cold was the common cold and the influenza with 79.84% in resident physicians and 56.76% in chief physicians. A total of 745 physicians chose options that the course of common cold will be lasting 4 to 7 days; 895 physicians chose options that old people are the most susceptible for complication; 669 physicians thought the common cold was the most common infection in winter; 841 physicians used clinical methods to diagnose the common cold; 736 physicians thought although the cold was a kind of self-limited disease and symptomatic treatment could alleviate symptoms and improve life quality, patients should see doctor in time if it turns to severer; and 745 physicians held the opinion that treatment of the common cold should focus on relieving symptoms first. In addition, 61.60% physicians had made prescription based on clinical symptoms; 505 (54.24%) of them thought compound drugs were priority in treating the common cold. However, there were still 43 physicians prescribed antibiotics for common cold.",
        "There is misunderstanding and discrepancy in cognition towards common cold and treatment among physicians from various levels of hospitals in mainland China. Physicians should standardize diagnosis and treatment for the common cold according to the domestic and foreign guidelines."
