        "The first National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) and National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR) are landmark events for children's health care quality and are expected to stimulate local measurement, benchmarking, and quality improvement efforts.",
        "The authors select findings from the NHQR and NHDR, focusing on topics reflecting a range of health care and health care settings affecting children. They highlight disparities by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and insurance source. They critique the first NHQR and NHDR from a child health perspective. SELECT NHQR/DR FINDINGS: Quality-of-care issues in the effectiveness domain were identified for black infant mortality, low and very low birth weight rates, antibiotic use for the common cold, and childhood hospitalizations for asthma. Immunization rates have improved. Patient centeredness and timeliness results vary by race, ethnicity and income. The NHDR found that Hispanic and low-income children are most likely to be uninsured for part of the year. Groups of children most likely to have public coverage are American Indian/Alaska native, black, and Hispanic. CRITIQUE OF REPORTS: The structure and criteria used for the first reports limit their usefulness from a child health perspective. A basic problem is that the conceptualizations of health and health care that are driving national initiatives on quality are based largely on an adult chronic care model focused on conditions with high expenditures as treated in the mainstream health care delivery system.",
        "NHQR and NHDR provide essential information on children's health care quality. Future reports can be improved by including child-relevant perspectives in priority-setting and data-gathering efforts."
