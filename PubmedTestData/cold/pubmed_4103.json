        "Nose-, sinus- and ear-symptoms, signs and tests were studied in 27 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. All subjects had had daily nasal discharge since birth or early childhood. X-ray examination showed sinusitis, and most patients had frequent episodes of sinusitis symptoms. The frequency of common colds was apparently not increased. As a general rule, the patients had chronic secretory otitis media, but few episodes of acute otitis media. Repeated suctions, punctures, and insertion of tubes had been disappointing, but more radical surgery of the nose and sinuses had helped some of the patients. It is concluded that knowledge of the very characteristic ENT symptoms is important in respect of an early diagnosis and starting preventive treatment in order to inhibit the development of lung damage. The ENT symptoms, on the other hand, are more often overtreated than the reverse."
