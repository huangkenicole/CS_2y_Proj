        "As winter draws on it is timely to look at ways in which nurses in the community may be faced with problems, expected and unexpected, when their patients are particularly affected by cold conditions and at the precautions which need to be taken to avoid or lessen adverse effects on their health. As in the case of heat-related risks to health, examined in an earlier article, so too in the case of cold those most at risk are elderly patients and those who are vulnerable due to a pre-existing condition affecting health even in a more clement climate. Cold weather attracts extra legal responsibilities which are examined in this article."
