        "The object of this investigation was to assess the extent to which absence on account of illness in children attending day-nurseries expressed the total morbidity. In four day-nurseries with a total capacity for 164 children, absence on account of illness and symptoms in the children present were registered over a period of 101 weekdays. Children were absent on 5.8% of the days on account of illness. The commonest causes were epidemic children's diseases, colds, sore throats and pyrexia. More than one third of the children present in the day-nurseries presented sign of illness. The most frequent of these were colds. Children were present in the day-nurseries five times as frequently with at least one symptom than they were absent on account of illness. Absence on account of illness provides an incomplete indication of illness among children attending day-nurseries as absence due to illness only represents a lesser quantitative fraction of the total morbidity among these children."
