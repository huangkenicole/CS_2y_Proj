        "Tympanoplasty is the most common ear surgery performed throughout the world. As its basic principles remain the same since its introduction, many publications usually explain, in the introduction, that tympanoplasty has been a successful technique since the 1950s. The aim of this historical notice is to go back to the origin of the word tympanoplasty, and its final introduction as a specific defined surgical concept.",
        "Historical study based solely on original publications in different languages.",
        "The term tympanoplasty was first used by Hirch in 1912 for an operation for chronic adhesive catarrh of the middle ear. It was revived by Wullstein in 1952. One Polish, Miodonski, and three German otologists played an important role in the development of the actual concept and definition of tympanoplasty: Moritz, Z\u00f6llner and Wullstein, the two latter being recognized as worldwide dispensers of the technique.",
        "The history of the term tympanoplasty can be divided into two periods: the first being 1912 to 1913 with its first use for an operation to treat chronic adhesive catarrh of the middle ear, and the second 1952 to 1955, with its revival and definitive implementation in the surgery of the ear based on the concept of protection of the round window and construction of an effective sound-transmitter system through the oval window. Nevertheless, the concept of tympanoplasty was already established in 1950 but not surgically definitively implemented: alea jacta erat-the die was cast!"
