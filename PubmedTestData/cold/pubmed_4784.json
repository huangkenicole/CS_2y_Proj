        "The effects of extreme cold water temperature, elevated cleaning water temperature, cleaning time on membrane performance, and pore size distribution were studied using flat-sheet polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Extreme cold water temperature led to a decrease in membrane permeability, and membrane pore size shrinkage. The use of periodical warm water (35\u202f\u00b0C) membrane conditioning could almost completely recover the membrane permeability and pore size structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature, while the use of room temperature (23\u00b11\u202f\u00b0C) conditioning recovered majority of the membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature. Changes in membrane performance correlate well with changes in membrane structure. Membranes periodically conditioned in warmer water temperature showed a higher permeability than that periodically conditioned at room temperature from a long-term operation of three months. The results suggest the change in PVDF membrane performance and structure caused by extreme cold water temperature is almost completely reversible after periodical warm water conditioning, and thus the use of warm water conditioning and/or chemical cleaning will benefit the recovery of membrane performance and structure change caused by extreme cold water temperature in cold regions."
