        "To estimate prevalence of excess intake of paracetamol and investigate seasonal variations therein.",
        "Between 2011 and 2016, 14\u2009481 US adults who used paracetamol in the preceding 30\u00a0days were sampled from national online panels and completed a detailed online daily diary of paracetamol medication use for 7\u00a0days. Respondents were not told that the study concerned paracetamol. Cold/flu season (CFS), identified using Google Trends data, was contrasted to off-season in symptoms, use of paracetamol medications, and consumption exceeding 4 g (the recommended daily maximum).",
        "Overall, 6.3% [95% confidence interval: 5.9-6.7%] of users exceeded 4 g on at least one day; 3.7% [3.5-3.8%] of usage days exceeded 4 g. Cold/flu symptoms were more likely to be experienced and treated with paracetamol in CFS than off-season. Paracetamol users were more likely to exceed 4 g during CFS (6.5% vs. 5.3%; odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 1.04-1.48); days exceeding 4 g also increased (3.9% vs. 2.8%; odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.37, 1.11-1.69). This was not due to differences in characteristics of individuals using paracetamol in CFS, but primarily to increased use of over-the-counter combination medications designed to treat upper respiratory cold/flu symptoms (33.2% of usage days in CFS vs. 24.8% in off-season; odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.58, 1.46-1.72). When such medications were omitted, there was no statistically significant seasonal variation in exceeding 4 g.",
        "Paracetamol use and over-dosing increases in CFS, primarily due to increased use of over-the-counter combinations treating upper respiratory cold/flu symptoms. Pharmacists should warn users to follow labelled dosing directions, especially during CFS."
