        "To determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rhinothermy for the common cold.",
        "Open label, randomised, controlled feasibility study.",
        "Single-centre research institute in New Zealand recruiting participants from the community.",
        "30 adult participants with symptoms of a common cold, presenting within 48\u2009hours of the onset of symptoms.",
        "Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 35\u2009L/min of 100% humidified air at 41\u00b0C via high flow nasal cannulae, 2\u2009hours per day for up to 5\u2009days (rhinothermy), or vitamin C 250\u2009mg daily for 5\u2009days (control).",
        "The primary outcome was the proportion of screened candidates who were randomised. Secondary outcomes included: proportion of randomised participants who completed the study; modified Jackson scores from randomisation to 10 days after initiation of randomised regimen; time until feeling 'a lot better' compared with study entry; time until resolution of symptoms or symptom score at 10 days postrandomisation; proportion of organisms identified by PCR analysis of nasal swabs taken at baseline; the patterns of use of the rhinothermy device; estimated adherence of the control group; and rhinothermy device tolerability.",
        "In all 30/79 (38%, 95%\u2009CI 27% to 50%) of potential participants screened for eligibility were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated, and all randomised participants completed the study (100%, 95%\u2009CI 88% to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson score was greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with the maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95%\u2009CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5-unit change.",
        "This study shows that an RCT of rhinothermy compared with low-dose vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is feasible.",
