        "Cold sensitivity, a common and disabling sequela of hand injury, can be assessed using the Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity (CISS) questionnaire, rating symptoms on a scale from 4 to 100. The primary objective of this study was to define a clinical cut-off for abnormal cold sensitivity based on the CISS score in a healthy working-age population. The secondary objective was to investigate how age, gender and previous injuries and diseases influence CISS scoring. In this study, 1239 out of 1582 selected healthy subjects of working age living in northern Sweden completed the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 78%. The 95th percentile for the CISS score was 49.5 for men and 53.0 for women. The effects of age, gender and previous injuries and diseases were minor and not considered clinically relevant. The results support that a CISS score above 50 should be considered as abnormal cold sensitivity.<b>Level of evidence:</b> III."
