        "Nasal congestion represents a troublesome health issue which is especially and invalidating in children. Effective nasal drugs, such as sympathomimetic drugs, are usually forbidden in children under 12 years of age because of their potential systemic adverse effects. Hypertonic nasal physiological solutions have recently been successfully used to decongest nasal mucosa in children: its mechanical activity has been universally recognized as safe and effective and it represents a well-established, useful treatment in children.",
        "We have retrospectively analyzed a case series of 40 children treated for 4 days (96 hours) with a new class 1s medical device nasal hypertonic spray containing Pirometaxine\u2122 (Narlisim\u2122) in outpatient affected by nasal congestion due to common cold. Every child was evaluated on a 3-point symptom assessment scale (0: no symptom; 1: mild symptom; 2: moderate symptom; 3: severe symptom) at the beginning of the trial (T0) and after 48 (T1) and 96 hours (T2). The symptoms assessed were nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, headache, flash of cold, pharyngodynia, cough, and sneeze.",
        "The results, in terms of short-term efficacy to control nasal obstruction (T1 vs. T0: P<0.0001; T2 vs. T0: P<0.0001), nasal secretion (T1 vs. T0: P<0.0001; T2 vs. T0: P<0.0001) and all the symptoms related to common cold have supported the efficacy of this hypertonic nasal solution. No adverse events have been pointed out during the trial supporting the safety of this new nasal hypertonic approach.",
        "The absence of adverse events after 48-96 hours along with the short-term effectiveness of this new treatment seems to represent a new, safe option to treat children affected by nasal congestion secondary to common cold. Considering the current lack of safe treatments for children under 12 years of age, Narlisim\u2122 can be considered as a useful short-term option to control nasal congestion in children."
