        "With the randomized, positive agent parallel controlled design adopted, the 80 subjects enrolled were assigned in the ratio of 3:1 to two groups, the 60 patients in the trial group were treated with PYG and the 20 in the control group treated with Ruyi Dingchuan Pill (RDP), with the therapeutic course consisting of 7 days for both groups. The clinical effects, effects on TCM syndrome and the changes of lung function after treatment were observed.",
        "The effect of the treatment on asthma in the trial group: clinically controlled rate was 6.67%, markedly effective rate 51.67%, improved rate 33.33% and ineffective rate 8.33%; and the corresponding rates in the control group were 5.00%, 50.00%, 30.00%, and 15.00% respectively. Comparison between the two groups showed insignificant difference (P>0.05). The effect on TCM syndrome in the treated group: clinically controlled rate was 11.67%, markedly effective rate 58.33%, effective rate 21.67% and ineffective rate 8.33%; and those in the control group were 10.00%, 50.00%, 30.00% and 10.00% respectively, also showing insignificant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). Lung function test showed that the change on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after treatment in the trial group was of statistical significance (P<0.05), but no significant difference was shown in the change of peak expiratory flow (PEF, P>0.05); while the changes in the control group were just the opposite, showing insignificance in FEV1 (P>0.05) but significance in PEF (P<0.05). Comparison of the therapeutic effect on lung function between the two groups showed no significant difference (P>0.05). No adverse reaction was found in either group in the course of treatment.",
        "PYG used to treat BS-QDC is effective and safe, it's effect is similar to that of RDP."
