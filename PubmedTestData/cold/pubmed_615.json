        "Currently, treatment for acute rhinitis (AR) is symptomatic but no clear agreement exists to control its development. Propolis extract may appear as a promising natural treatment for AR, but its beneficial effects have not yet been fully tested. Forty children suffering from AR and common cold symptoms aged between 2-12 years were enrolled in a prospective epidemiological multicentre study. A 7-day treatment with propolis nasal spray (3 times/day) was applied and a comparison of symptomatology, subjective global improvement and quality of life (QoL) between baseline (day 1) and final (day 7) visits were performed. The main goal was to evaluate the changes in symptom intensity using the Jackson\u0092s scoring test. After 7 days of treatment there was a significant decrease of symptoms both in the total score (p less than 0.0001) and in regard to each AR symptom (p less than 0.01). On the whole, the sample reported no symptoms by day 7, and the resolution of symptoms occurred approximately at day 4. Furthermore, there was no need for supplementary treatment. Both the subjective global improvement impression and the QoL of patients appeared to significantly improve after treatment. No adverse events (AEs) were found globally. It can be concluded that propolis nasal spray effectively improves recovery from infectious AR and common cold symptoms in children and is an optimal alternative in the treatment of this disease without need for any adjuvant treatment."
