      "AbstractText": [
        "A simple, efficient and accurate gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) method for the simultaneous determination of eight active ingredients in cough-cold syrups has been developed. The active ingredients under study were bromhexine, chlorpheniramine, codeine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, ephedrine/pseudoephedrine, guaiphenesin and papaverine. Before injection, the active ingredients were first separated, from the excipients present in the cough-cold syrups, with chloroform, from alkaline medium. They were then separated by GLC on a glass column (5 ft x 2 mm i.d.) packed with 3% of OV-25 supported on Supelcoport (80-100 mesh). The column temperature was maintained at 170 degrees C for 1 min, then programmed to 265 degrees C at a rate of 10 degrees C min-1, and maintained at this temperature for 10 and 1 min, respectively, for samples with and without papaverine. The flow-rate of the nitrogen carrier gas was 30 ml min-1. A flame-ionisation detector was used for detection, and clomipramine hydrochloride was used as the internal standard. The recoveries of the drugs ranged from 96.0 to 99.7%, and the relative standard deviations for ten replicate determinations ranged from 0.49 to 4.7%. Results are reported for nine commercially available cough-cold syrups."
