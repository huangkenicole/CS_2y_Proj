        "Acute rhinopharyngitis, usually called common cold, is a widespread disease, mainly in childhood and adolescence. The use of common cold relievers is, therefore, prevalent as documented by the market data. A well-established tradition considers natural remedies an effective and safe way to relieve the common cold. Hundreds of products for treating the common cold contain non-pharmacological components. Nevertheless, a few studies investigated the role of non-pharmacologic remedies for the common cold. The current study reported the most common non-pharmacological remedies for the common cold, including herbal medicines and other substances. As ancient people used traditional herbs to treat and prevent the common cold, various herbs are widely used to clear viral infections. The herbal agents include polyphenols, flavonoids, saponins, glucosides, and alkaloids. Moreover, other non-pharmacological agents are widely used in real-life. Many multi- or monocomponent dietary supplements or medical devices contain these substances and are available in the market as tablets, syrups, drops, nasal or oral sprays, and nebulization solutions. Many products are available in the market. However, there is some evidence only for some substances. Consequently, further rigorous studies should confirm natural products' efficacy and safety to relieve the common cold."
