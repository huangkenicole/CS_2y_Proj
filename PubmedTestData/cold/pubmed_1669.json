        "To investigate the incidence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in the patients with asthma induced by the common cold, diagnosed by the patients themselves, and the relationship between AR and asthma.",
        "All the patients were inquired and examined in details, including counting the eosiphils in the smear of the nasal secretion and allergen skin test.",
        "49(47.6%) out of 103 asthmatics with so-called common cold were diagnosed as AR. The average of the initial asthmatic episode in asthmatics with AR were significantly younger than that in patients without AR, (28 +/- 13) and (36 +/- 16) years, respectively (P < 0.01). There was concordance between asthma and AR on seasonal regularity of episode.",
        "(1) In large portion of asthma, common cold diagnosed by patients themselves actually is AR; (2) There is a close relationship between AR and asthma; (3) It is important for physicians to distinguish AR from common cold in asthmatics."
