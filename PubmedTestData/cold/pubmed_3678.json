        "The study goals were to assess, via survey (a) parental knowledge regarding the use of over-the counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines in children younger than the age of 6 years and (b) the effects of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations on community pediatricians following voluntary withdrawal of these medications. Of the 179 parents surveyed, approximately 60% had used OTC cough and cold medicines in the past, and many parents indicated an inappropriate dose when asked. Parents who were aware of the recall were significantly less likely to continue use (P < .05). All 33 physicians surveyed were aware of the withdrawal of these medications for children younger than age 2 years and most were aware of consideration to remove these medications for children <6 years old. A total of 15% of physicians reported that FDA considerations were likely to change their practice by reducing or discontinuing use of these medications, whereas 6% would continue recommending these medications."
