        "Macrolide usage in Japan exceeds that in Europe and the United States. Investigating the actual conditions in which macrolides are used is important for identifying further interventions for appropriate antimicrobial use; however, this situation has not been evaluated in Japan. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the number of macrolide prescriptions and their changes before and after implementation of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Action Plan. In addition, we also investigated the names of diseases for which macrolides have been prescribed and the number of days of prescription. A retrospective observational study was conducted using JMDC claims data from January 2013 to December 2018. The proportion of all oral antimicrobials and macrolides used during this period and the diseases for which macrolides were used in the 3 years before and after the AMR Action Plan were determined separately for acute (< 14 prescription days) and chronic (> 14 prescription days) diseases. The number of prescriptions for macrolides constituted approximately 30% of those for all oral antimicrobials; of these, clarithromycin accounted for approximately 60%. Most prescriptions for acute diseases were for common cold, whereas allergic and dermatological diseases were included among chronic diseases. The names of these illnesses did not change before and after the AMR Action Plan. Overall, these results indicate that appropriate macrolide use involves a review of their use for common cold along with appropriate evaluation of their long-term use for skin and allergic diseases. They also indicate the need for further fact-finding studies and ongoing AMR measures."
