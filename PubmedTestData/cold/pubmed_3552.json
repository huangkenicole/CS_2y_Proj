      "AbstractText": [
        "There is a continuing interest in defining the incidence, prevalence and burden of otitis media (OM) in the individual and population for purposes of assigning \"risk factors\". Often overlooked in past studies are the contributions of cold-like illnesses (CLIs) and sampling interval to those estimates.",
        "Describe the incidence of symptomatic (AOM) and asymptomatic (OME) OM, the prevalence of OM, the contribution of CLI incidence, burden and other OM \"risk factors\" to the incidence and burden of OM, and the effect of sampling interval on those measures in children.",
        "148 children (74 male; 131 white, aged 1.0-8.6 years) were followed from November 1 to April 30 by weekly pneumatic otoscopy to diagnose OM presence/absence and by daily parental diary to assign CLI episodes. Data for previously identified OM \"risk factors\" were collected on 127. Results were summarized using standard measures of incidence, prevalence and burden, and multiple regression techniques were used to identify OM \"risk factors\".",
        "The basal OM prevalence was 20% with peaks in December and March and the temporal pattern was correlated with CLI prevalence. The incidence of OME (per 27,232 child-days) was 317, AOM was 74 and CLI was 456. The seasonal pattern of AOM and OME incidences tracked and was correlated with that for CLIs. New OM episodes were usually of short duration (<or=7 days in 40%, <or=4 weeks in 75-90%) and the usual OM burden was low (median=12%). OM and breastfeeding histories and CLI incidence/prevalence were significant predictors of OME and AOM incidence and OM burden. Longer sampling intervals were less efficient in capturing AOM and OME durations and incidences, but not OM burden.",
        "These results demonstrate a high incidence and prevalence of OM, most OM episodes were of short duration and longer sampling intervals introduced biases into some parameter estimates. There was a significant relationship between OM and CLI incidence, prevalence and burden suggesting that CLI experience should be controlled for in assessing independent \"risk factors\" for AOM and OME."
