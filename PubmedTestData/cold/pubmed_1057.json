        "Respiratory viral infections may worsen bronchial hyperreactivity. However, there is no data on the possible role of recurrent infectious rhinitis in nose hyperreactivity. This study was therefore designed to investigate whether subjects suffering from recurrent common cold have nasal hyperreactivity, assessed by histamine nasal challenge. This study included a group of 40 patients (19 males, mean age 34.1 years) with history of at least five episodes of common cold in the previous year, but without documented allergy, and twenty healthy subjects (8 males, mean age 32.3 years) were enrolled as control group, all of whom were non-allergic. Nasal provocation test with histamine was performed in all subjects. Nasal provocation test with histamine induced a 200% increase in nasal resistance after provocation in 24 (60%) patients suffering from recurrent viral rhinitis. No normal subject had an increase >180% in nasal resistance. There was a significant difference between the patient group and the control group (p<0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that nasal hyperreactivity might be a sequela of recurrent common cold. Further studies should be conducted to confirm this preliminary finding."
