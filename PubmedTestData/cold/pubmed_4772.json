        "Pharmacists play a key role in primary healthcare, but the characteristics of patients who consult a pharmacist directly rather than going to their general practitioner (GP) are unknown. Our aim was to describe the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who seek direct therapeutic advice from a pharmacist for influenza-like illness (ILI) or ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders, the types of medicines dispensed and patient satisfaction with the advice received.",
        "This prospective, observational study was carried out on a random sample of French pharmacies between November 2010 and March 2011. Patients (\u226512-years) with early symptoms of ILI or ENT disorders (<36 h duration) who received treatment were included. Socio-demographic data, symptom severity and disease impact on daily activities and sleep were recorded at inclusion. Symptom evolution and patient satisfaction were assessed after 3 days of treatment.",
        "573 patients (mean age: 42.5 \u00b1 16.2 years; 61.9% female) were recruited by 133 pharmacies. Two-thirds of patients (63.2%) visited the pharmacy early (<24 h) after symptom onset. The most common symptoms were runny nose (56.4%), sore throat (54.6%) and cough (49.0%). Patients were given 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 medications; 98.4% of patients received allopathic (usually paracetamol, 33.5%) and 25.3% homeopathic (Oscillococcinum, 56.6%) treatment, usually combined with allopathy. Compliance was good and 77.2% of patients continued treatment for 3 days. Most symptoms improved significantly after 3 days and quality of life was enhanced. 85.9% of patients were satisfied with the advice received.",
        "Seeking a pharmacist's advice for the management of ILI and ENT disorders has several public health benefits. The clinical improvement and high patient satisfaction observed validate the role of the pharmacist as a health professional of first resort."
