        "To assess the appropriateness of prescription medication use based upon widely accepted treatment guidelines.",
        "We analyzed administrative claims for the period October 1, 1998, through September 20, 1999, supplied by 3 California health plans to determine medication use patterns for outpatient prescriptions. We compared these patterns to those expected in the presence of adherence to treatment guidelines.",
        "During the study period, only 27.5% of antidepressant users received the recommended 6 months of continuous therapy, only 49.0% of diagnosed asthma patients received at least one inhaled corticosteroid prescription (compared to 67.1% who received at least one inhaled beta-agonist prescription), and only 54.5% of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) received an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Of patients who had a diagnosis of common cold or upper respiratory tract infection, 35.7% received antibiotics.",
        "There is a remarkable degree of apparent overuse and underuse of prescription medications despite the existence of clinical guidelines to support appropriate use in the conditions studied. Effective medications appear to be underused for patients with asthma, CHF, and depression. Antibiotics appear to be overused for the common cold and upper respiratory infections. More effective efforts must be made to address appropriate use of medications. Without these efforts, improved quality of care and decreased total health system costs are unlikely to be realized."
