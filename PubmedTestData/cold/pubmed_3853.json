      "AbstractText": [
        "C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) are crucial transcriptional activators in plant responses to low temperature. CBF4 differs in its slower, but more persistent regulation and its role in cold acclimation. Cold acclimation has accentuated relevance for tolerance to late spring frosts as they have become progressively more common, as a consequence of blurred seasonality in the context of global climate change. In the current study, we explore the functions of CBF4 from grapevine, VvCBF4. Overexpression of VvCBF4 fused to GFP in tobacco BY-2 cells confers cold tolerance. Furthermore, this protein shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to cold stress, associated with an accumulation of transcripts for other CBFs and the cold responsive gene, ERD10d. This response differs for chilling as compared to freezing and is regulated differently by upstream signalling involving oxidative burst, proteasome activity and jasmonate synthesis. The difference between chilling and freezing is also seen in the regulation of the <i>CBF4</i> transcript in leaves from different grapevines differing in their cold tolerance. Therefore, we propose the quality of cold stress is transduced by different upstream signals regulating nuclear import and, thus, the transcriptional activation of grapevine <i>CBF4</i>."
