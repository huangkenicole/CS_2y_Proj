        "The purpose of this study was to examine self-care behaviors that older adults use to manage cold and influenza episodes. Interviews were conducted with 160 adults aged 65 to 94. A large number and a variety of cold- and influenza-related self-care actions were reported. Medication administration was found to be common for colds (79% of subjects) and influenza (95%). Subjects reported more illness-specific preventive behaviors for influenza than for colds. Influenza vaccination behavior was related to experiences with vaccination-associated illness, health state, and talking with physicians about vaccination. Few subjects identified potential hazards associated with influenza or colds."
