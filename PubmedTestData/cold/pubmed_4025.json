        "This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of prescriptions of cold combination products among older ambulatory patients. A retrospective observational study was conducted using electronic medical records. All patients aged 65\u00a0years or older who continued visiting internal medicine physicians for at least 1\u00a0year were included. The primary outcome was the prescription of cold combination products by any physicians in National Hospital Organization Tochigi Medical Center during a 1-year follow-up.",
        "Seven hundred fifty-six patients were included. The mean age was 75.4\u00a0years, 392 (51.9%) were men, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1.8, and the mean number of medications was 4.9. The proportion of patients who were prescribed cold combination products during the 1-year follow-up was 6.1% (95% confidence interval 4.4-7.8%). The prescription of cold combination products was not significantly associated with age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.11) or Charlson Comorbidity Index (p\u00a0=\u00a00.93) but was associated with an increasing number of medications (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A substantial proportion of older ambulatory patients were exposed to cold combination products during a 1-year follow-up."
