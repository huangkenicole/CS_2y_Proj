        "Plants have evolved to adapt and grow in hot and cold climatic conditions. Some also adapt to daily and seasonal temperature changes. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in regulating plant tolerance under such conditions. DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone proteins influence gene expression during plant developmental stages and under stress conditions, including cold and heat stress. While short-term modifications are common, some modifications may persist and result in stress memory that can be inherited by subsequent generations. Understanding the mechanisms of epigenomes responding to stress and the factors that trigger stress memory is crucial for developing climate-resilient agriculture, but such an integrated view is currently limited. This review focuses on the plant epigenetic stress memory during cold and heat stress. It also discusses the potential of machine learning to modify stress memory through epigenetics to develop climate-resilient crops."
