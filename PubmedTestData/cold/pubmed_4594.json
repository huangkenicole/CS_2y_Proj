        "The usefulness of murine pulmonary defense systems as a means for assessing potential toxicity was further confirmed. Recent investigations had indicated that the effects of a chemical agent on mucociliary transport and phagocytic function comprised a sensitive indicator. As one example of such an application, because of the wide usage of proprietary colds preparations containing volatile oils, as well as the use of such oils in various industries, it is important to reassess the potential of such preparations for toxicity when new test systems become available. Mice and rats were exposed to vapors of camphor, menthol, eucalyptol, and turpentine, as contained in a commonly used colds preparation, for 4 and 8 hr prior to challenge with aerosols of radiolabeled Staphylococcus aureus. The exposure system simulated conditions present when the colds preparation is vaporized according to directions for use. Rates of pulmonary bacterial transport and inactivation, as well as of phagocytic ingestion, were determined following exposure to the colds preparation. Each of these rates was unchanged by the treatment. Thus, in this biological system exposure to therapeutic levels of the colds preparation did not impair mucociliary or phagocytic function."
