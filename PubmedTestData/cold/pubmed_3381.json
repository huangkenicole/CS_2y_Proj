      "AbstractText": [
        "Air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infections and asthma exacerbations. We previously reported impaired Type-I and Type-III interferons (IFN-\u03b2/\u03bb) from airway epithelial cells of preschool children with asthma and/or atopy. In this study we analyzed the association between rhinovirus-induced IFN-\u03b2/\u03bb epithelial expression and acute exposure to the principal outdoor air pollutants in the same cohort.",
        "We studied 34 children (17asthmatics/17non-asthmatics) undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy for clinical indications. Bronchial epithelial cells were harvested by brushing, cultured and experimentally infected with Rhinovirus Type 16 (RV16). RV16-induced IFN-\u03b2 and \u03bb expression was measured by quantitative real time PCR, as was RV16vRNA. The association between IFNs and the mean exposure to PM10, SO2 and NO<sub>2</sub> in the day preceding bronchoscopy was evaluated using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Gamma distribution.",
        "Acute exposure to PM10 and NO<sub>2</sub> was negatively associated to RV16-induced IFN\u03b2 mRNA. For each increase of 1ug/m<sup>3</sup> of NO<sub>2</sub> we found a significative decrease of 2.3x10<sup>3</sup> IFN-\u03b2 mRNA copies and for each increase of 1ug/m<sup>3</sup> of PM10 a significative decrease of 1x10<sup>3</sup> IFN-\u03b2 mRNA copies. No significant associations were detected between IFN-\u03bb mRNA and NO<sub>2</sub> nor PM10. Increasing levels of NO<sub>2</sub> (but not PM10) were found to be associated to increased RV16 replication.",
        "Short-term exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM10 is associated to a reduced IFN-\u03b2 expression by the airway epithelium, which may lead to increased viral replication. These findings suggest a potential mechanism underlying the link between air pollution, viral infections and asthma exacerbations."
