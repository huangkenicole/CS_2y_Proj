        "To explore the therapeutic effect of Ganrening Granule (GRN) in treating common cold.",
        "Four hundred cases of common cold were randomly divided into three groups, the GRN group (160 Patients), the control group (100 Patients) and the opened group (140 Patients). The changes in symptoms and body temperature of patients were observed before and after treatment by single blind method, and the therapeutic effect was assessed according to the \"Guideline of Clinical Research of TCM New Drugs\".",
        "The markedly effective rate and total effective rate of the GRN group were 81.25% and 96.88% respectively, while those of the control group were 44.44% and 88.00% respectively. The difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.01). GRN showed significant effect in subsiding fever.",
        "GRN has good effect in treating common cold (Syndrome of both Weifen and Qifen). No adverse effect was found in the clinical trial."
