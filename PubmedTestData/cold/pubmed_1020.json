        "The common cold is an infectious viral disease of the upper respiratory tract that has become the most frequent infectious disease in humans. Currently there is no cure for the common cold, and treatment typically focuses on alleviating symptoms. Although antiviral treatment is an important focus of current research, more than 200 viral strains have been associated with the common cold, making antiviral drug interventions difficult. Ganduqing is a Chinese medicinal preparation composed of Astragalus and Shegan. Several randomized controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate treatment of the common cold, but their effectiveness and safety have not been scientifically evaluated. In this study, we will systematically examine the efficacy and safety of Ganduqing in patients with common cold.",
        "The following electronic databases will be systematically and comprehensively searched: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Science Network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Database and Chinese Journal Database, for randomized controlled trials that used Ganduqing for treating the common cold through June 2020. The primary outcomes were signs and symptoms of the common cold, including cough, sore throat, fever, nasal congestion and runny nose. Secondary outcomes included changes in the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and recurrence. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment will be independently conducted by 2 researchers. Meta-analyses incorporating data derived from the literature will conduct using Review Manager (RevMan) v.5.3 and Stata 14 software. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework will be used to assess the quality of evidence derived from the meta-analyses.",
        "This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide an evidence of Ganduqing for the common cold and will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and/or presentations at scientific conferences.",
        "This systematic review will provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of Ganduqing in treating common colds.",
