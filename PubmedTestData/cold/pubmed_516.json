        "Jingfang Granules have the effects of inducing sweating to releasing exterior, dispersing wind and dispelling dampness. Modern studies have demonstrated that it has antipyretic and antiviral activities. Therefore, this trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jingfang Granules in the treatment of common cold(wind-cold syndrome). A total of 138 common cold(wind-cold syndrome) patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned into the experimental group(n=92) and the placebo group(n=46) at a ratio of 2\u22361 and respectively received Jingfang Granules and Jingfang Granules simulation agent. The treatment lasted for 5 d, and the follow-up time was 8 d. Recovery time was employed as the main indicator of efficacy. The median reco-very time of the experimental group was 3.33 d, shorter than that 7.00 d of the placebo group. The efficacy of the experimental group was better than that of the placebo group(P&lt;0.000 1). The major symptom severity score-time AUC of the experimental group was 489.90\u00b1206.95, which was smaller than that of the placebo group(763.50\u00b1339.53). The recovery rate and marked effective rate of the experimental group were higher than those of the placebo group, The above outcomes were statistically significant between the two groups(P&lt;0.05). The disappearance time and rate of single symptoms including aversion to cold, nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, headache, pharyngeal itching/pain, white sputum, and somatalgia also had significant differences between the two groups(P&lt;0.05), indicating that Jingfang Granules had good performance in alleviating the above symptoms. During the study period, one case of the experimental group had a slight increase in serum creatinine, which returned to the normal level after re-examination. The incidence of adverse reactions was 1.10%, and no serious adverse reaction was found. The two groups had no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions. In conclusion, Jingfang Granules can significantly shorten the course of common cold(wind-cold syndrome) and quickly alleviate the clinical symptoms, demonstrating good safety and clinical advantages."
