        "To describe, compare and evaluate whether pharmacists in two European countries, Serbia and Norway, give appropriate counselling for common ailments in pregnancy.",
        "A cross sectional, web-based study.",
        "A study was conducted among Serbian and Norwegian pharmacists during two four-month study periods in 2012 respectively 2014. Participants were recruited through postal and electronic invitation facilitated by several pharmacy chains. Participation in the study was anonymous and voluntary.",
        "Pharmacists were presented with the questionnaire that included five scenarios (back pain, heavy legs, nausea, cold and constipation in pregnancy) and were asked to give their advice about use of medicines, supplements (e.g. herbal products, vitamins, minerals), non-pharmacological treatment and referral to physician in each condition.",
        "In total, 276 pharmacists, 119 in Serbia and 157 in Norway, accepted to participate in the study. Recommendation about medicines use ranged from 32% (heavy legs) to 71% (back pain) in Serbia and from 3% (heavy legs) to 92% (constipation) in Norway. Several pharmacists' recommendations on medicines and supplements use were inappropriate. Recommendation about non-pharmacological treatments ranged from 11% (nausea) to 50% (heavy legs) in Serbia and from 12% (constipation) to 63% (cold) in Norway. Approximately 12% of the Norwegian and Serbian pharmacists offered referral to a physician as only advice for nausea in pregnancy, indicating a lack of confidence in or knowledge about this common ailment in pregnancy.",
        "Large differences in counselling of pregnant women by pharmacists in Serbia and Norway were observed. Enhancement of pharmacists' knowledge about treatment of common ailments in pregnancy is needed and will enhance pharmacists' role in improving maternal health."
