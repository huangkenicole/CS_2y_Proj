        "The interaction between short-term sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure and experimentally induced rhinovirus infection was studied in thirty-two volunteers divided into two groups balanced with respect to age, antibody levels, and nasal mucus flow rates. One group was exposed to SO2 exposure at the threshold limit value (TLV) of 5 ppm during 4 hours; the other group served as controls exposed to pollution-free air under the same conditions. The SO2 exposure caused a 50% decrease in nasal mucus flow rate in the anterior parts of the nose, but there was no difference in the number of colds which developed in the two groups. The group exposed to SO2 had fewer symptoms and a possibly shorter incubation period (P = .06), and virus shedding was at a lower level but more persistent than in the control group. No differences were found in antibody response. The rhinovirus infection in the control group caused a gradual decrease in nasal mucus flow rate starting 2 days after the virus instillation, and after 5 days the rate was less than half its initial value. For future experiments on the interaction between airborne pollutants and rhinovirus infections, a virus challenge by aerosol inhalation is recommended. Our study supports an earlier observation that growth of influenza virus in the nasal cavity of mice was inhibited by exposure to SO2 concentrations of 6 or 20 ppm."
