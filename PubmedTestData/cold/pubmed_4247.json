        "Exercise Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) prevalence in cold weather athletes is high. Currently, no standardized cold air exercise provocation test exists. Thus we aimed to determine EIB prevalence using a Cold Air Test (CAT; 5\u202fkm outdoor running; -15\u202f\u00b0C) compared to the most common EIB screen the Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperpnea (EVH) test in cold weather athletes. Sixteen (9 male; 20-35 years old) cold weather athletes completed EVH 72\u202fh before CAT. Spirometry, Fractional Expired Nitric Oxide (FENO), respiratory symptoms were measured and atopy status was determined. Five and 7 participants were EIB\u202f+\u202fon the EVH and CAT, respectively. Level of agreement was 50% between tests. FEV<sub>1</sub> recovery was significantly prolonged and Peak Expiratory Flow was decreased after CAT compared to EVH. Predictive characteristics of EIB\u202f+\u202fincluded FENO >12\u202fppb, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio (<0.75) and BMI\u202f<\u202f20. EVH does not always reflect EIB triggered by cold weather exercise. More research is required to understand the best EIB screens for cold weather athletes."
