        "To achieve effective primary care we need to take into account lay perspectives on services. This study investigated a sample of 54 mothers with at least one child under five years old to elucidate their approaches to minor illnesses in their children and their use of pharmacists. The use of the pharmacist and of proprietary medicines were found to be important elements in self-care, sometimes replacing general practitioner consultations. However, the mothers held differing opinions about how to deal with children's symptoms and who to contact for help. This variety needs to be taken into account when recommending changes in the provision of primary care for this group, especially concerning the role of the pharmacist."
