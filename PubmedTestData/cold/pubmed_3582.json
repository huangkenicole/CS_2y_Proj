        "The aim of the trial was to examine the effectiveness of an oral decongestant in common cold. Thirty subjects with naturally acquired colds got a 100 mg sustained release tablet containing norephedrine on one day and a placebo tablet on another day in double blind design. Changes in nasal patency were assessed by rhinomanometry, measurement of nasal expiratory peak flow, and a self-assessment test, and the number of sneezes and of nose blowings were recorded in a 10 hours period after medication. Rhinomanometry, but not peak flow measurements showed a significant difference (p less than 0.02) two hours after medication, and the self-assessment of nasal blockage showed that the effect lasted for the entire 10 hours observation period (p less than 0.01). Nasal respiration was reestablished in half of the blocked noses. There was no effect on number of sneezes and nose blowings. In conclusion, oral norephedrine has a moderate decongestant effect, which may justify its use in adults with common colds. This symptom amelioration must be balanced against cost of therapy and risk of side effects. A prevention of otitis media and of sinusitis has not been documented in the literature."
