        "This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 30-mg tablets in children aged 6 to 11\u00a0years for the temporary relief of nasal congestion due to the common cold. The primary efficacy end point was the weighted sum of the change from baseline in instantaneous nasal congestion severity score over the period from 1 to 8 hours following the first dose of study drug on day 1. Safety assessments included adverse events, sleepiness ratings, and vital signs. Pseudoephedrine was superior to placebo in reducing instantaneous nasal congestion severity in pediatric children over the first 8\u00a0hours after dosing on day\u00a01 (least squares mean difference between treatment groups was 1.2;\u00a0P = .029). Overall, secondary end points associated with nasal congestion were supportive on day 1, whereas secondary end points on day 2 were only numerically favorable. Somnolence was reported in a greater percentage of children on pseudoephedrine compared to placebo (71.9% vs 63.9%), while similar percentages of children in the same respective groups reported insomnia (34.4% and 38.9%) and nervousness (20.0% and 23.6%).Pseudoephedrine provides temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with the common cold in children 6 to <12 years of age at the current over-the-counter monograph dose. Multiple dosing of pseudoephedrine for up to 7\u00a0days, when given as needed for symptom relief, was generally safe in this population of children with the common cold."
