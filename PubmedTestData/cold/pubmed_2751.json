        "About 14,000 paired sera, from patients with various types of acute infectious diseases with suspected viral origin, were screened by complement fixation against a wide set of viral antigens, including coronavirus OC43. A significant change in OC43 antibodies was recorded in 33 cases and a constant high titre, defined as a titre occurring in the respective age group in less than 1% of all sera examined, was found in 45 cases. On the basis of careful retrospective analysis of hospital case records it was concluded that in 28 cases with an increase of OC43 antibody titres, and in two with titre decrease, a disease could be associated with an acute coronavirus infection. In 16 cases the disease was dominated by respiratory symptoms. Eight of these patients, four children and four adults, had pneumonia. Three of the eight pneumonia patients had, however, another concomitant infection, too. Four patients had neurological symptoms, one had severe perimyocarditis, and in five cases fever was the only symptom recorded. Among the patients with a statistically significant high titre of OC43 antibodies, there were 14 cases where a suggestive association with a disease could be envisaged on the basis of hospital records. Five of these patients had pneumonia. These results suggest that human coronaviruses, so far considered only as one group of causative agents of the common cold, may also be associated with other and more severe diseases in all age groups."
