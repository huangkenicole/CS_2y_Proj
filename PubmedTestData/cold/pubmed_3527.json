        "Seventy-six cases of unilateral tonsillectomy performed over the last 20 years are reported. The average age was 3.75 years. Fifty per cent had adenoidectomy. A review of their case notes and of 54 questionnaires returned by parents, asking their opinion of the change in symptoms before operation and two years after operation, showed that they could be allotted into three groups: Group 1 35 cases (65 per cent) had dramatic improvement in the symptoms of allergy, colds, otitis, sore throats, eating, meat eating and sleep. Group 2 of nine cases (17 per cent) had considerable improvement in most symptoms. Group 3 of 10 cases (18 per cent) had minimal improvement. Post-tonsillectomy hypertrophy of the remaining tonsil occurred within two to four years in nine cases, necessitating removal. Four (11 per cent) in Group 1, (22 per cent) in Group 2, and three (30 per cent) in Group 3. The three secondary tonsillectomies in Group 3 gave good results in two cases. In five cases the other tonsil was removed six to 15 years later. This series of cases has demonstrated that a tremendous decrease in incidence of throat and upper respiratory tract infection in young children, apparently prone to infection can occur in over 80 per cent of cases following unilateral tonsillectomy, in spite of the continued presence of the remaining large tonsil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
