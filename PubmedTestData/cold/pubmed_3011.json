        "The occurrence of upper respiratory symptoms among adult Danes was examined by the use of data from the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey 1986-1987. In this study, 14.0 per cent of 6,672 individuals reported complaints of colds or coughs (CC) during the two-week period preceding the interview. Reporting of CC decreased with age, but there was no sex difference. A multivariate analysis, including a number of suspected exposure variables, showed that CC was reported significantly more frequently (OR 1.42) by individuals also reporting exposure to external health risks in their homes. The reporting of CC was not associated with occupational exposure, psychological stress, spare time physical activity or smoking habits. Using bivariate analysis, it was shown that exposure to external health risks in the home was reported more frequently among women than men. The results indicate, that exposure to external health risks in dwellings contributes significantly to the total morbidity among adult Danes. However, improvement of the validity of information about exposure by means of more objective methods is required."
