        "We evaluated 758 sick children younger than 3 years of age for Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) upper respiratory infection (URI) to determine the usual clinical presentation of the disease in this age group, indications for culture and the optimal site(s) from which to isolate the organism. GABHS infection was documented in 35 subjects (4.6%). The classic presentation (as proposed in the 1940s) of GABHS URI in children younger than 3 years of age was not confirmed by this study. In 32 of the GABHS cases there were pharyngitis, common cold symptoms or both, and these were associated with acute otitis media 10 times and with otitis media with effusion 3 times. Clinical impetigo was associated with GABHS URI (4 of 32 cases). GABHS URI would not have been documented in 6 of 32 cases if cultures of the anterior nares had not been performed. Children between 18 and 36 months of age were more likely to have GABHS disease than were younger children. Hoarseness and vomiting occurred less frequently in children younger than 36 months with GABHS infection than in those of that age who had non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal illnesses. A history of two or more siblings at home or a family member with a recent streptococcal infection and the presence of irritability, a reddened throat or palate or uvular edema were each associated with GABHS URI. We concluded that sick children between 18 and 36 months of age with a reddened throat should have cultures taken of the throat and anterior nares for GABHS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
