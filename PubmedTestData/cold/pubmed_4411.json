        "To explore whether the presence of illness is a predisposing factor to scalds in children aged five years and under.",
        "A mixed methodology approach was used in this exploratory study. The results from the questionnaire phase are reported in this article. Questionnaires (n = 90) were sent out to the parents and carers of all children who had been admitted to a regional paediatric burns unit with scalds in the previous year. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected.",
        "These supported many of the findings in the literature. A typical child who had been scalded was a male toddler who was injured in the kitchen of his own home in the presence of a carer. Half of the children in this study were unwell around the time of the accident.",
        "Although this was a small pilot study, the need for parents and health carers to be vigilant is highlighted particularly when a child is unwell."
