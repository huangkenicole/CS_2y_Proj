        "The review presents data on the natural circulation of Bartonellas and Erlichias with the participation of lice, fleas, mosquitoes, Ixodes ticks, as well as rodents, large wild mammals, and domestic animals. It outlines the human infection routes that are mainly associated with the attack of infected carriers and with the contacts with different warm-blooded animals. The risk of bartonellosis spread is evidenced by the data showing that 12.3% of clothes lice collected from homeless individuals in Moscow turned out to be infected. In a focus of erlichiasis, the infection rates of Ambliomma americanum and Ixodes scapularis were 4.9 and as high as 20%, respectively; 100% of white-tailed deers (Odocoileus virginianus) were seropositive. However, many issues associated with the preservation of these natural vectors, with the route of their transmission to human beings and animals are to be studied."
