        "The A2 strain of human respiratory syncytial virus replicated in the nose and lung of BALB/c mice, with virus growing to higher titers in older animals than in younger animals. Virus was recovered from the nose between days 2 and 7 with peak titers on days 3 and 4, and from the lungs between days 2 and 9, with peak titers on days 4 through 6. Serum antibody developed 2 weeks after infection. Viral antigen was demonstrated in the alveolar cells of the lung by immunofluorescence. Histopathological changes included infiltration by mononuclear cells of the peribronchiolar and perivascular tissue, some interstitial thickening, and formation of multinucleated giant cells. Virus could not be recovered from the respiratory tract of mice inoculated with bovine strains of respiratory syncytial virus. Growth of the A2 strain of human respiratory syncytial virus in different cell lines affected its infectivity for mice. Infection of BALB/c mice with respiratory syncytial virus provides a highly reproducible model for the study of the pathogenesis of and mechanisms of immunity to this virus."
