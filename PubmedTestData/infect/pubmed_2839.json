        "From September 1994 to May 1996, a strain of multi-resistant Chryseobacterium (Flavobacterium) meningosepticum was isolated from eight neonates on a neonatal intensive care unit. The strain was resistant to ampicillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, susceptible to piperacillin and amikacin, and had variable susceptibility to rifampicin and vancomycin. Two neonates were infected (one had pneumonia and one septicaemia and meningitis); the remaining six neonates were colonized in the respiratory secretions. Two cases occurred that could not be explained by cross-infection during the outbreak. Environmental screening recovered C. meningosepticum from sink taps. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal macrorestriction digests of patient and environmental isolates showed them to be representatives of a single strain. The outbreak was controlled after staff were required to use an alcoholic handrub after washing hands, and toiletting of babies was done with sterile water instead of tap-water. Repair and chlorination of the water-tanks and changing the sink-taps resolves the outbreak."
