      "AbstractText": [
        "HIV-1 can use cell-free and cell-associated transmission modes to infect new target cells, but how the virus spreads in the infected host remains to be determined. We recently established 3D collagen cultures to study HIV-1 spread in tissue-like environments and applied iterative cycles of experimentation and computation to develop a first in silico model to describe the dynamics of HIV-1 spread in complex tissue. These analyses (i) revealed that 3D collagen environments restrict cell-free HIV-1 infection but promote cell-associated virus transmission and (ii) defined that cell densities in tissue dictate the efficacy of these transmission modes for virus spread. In this review, we discuss, in the context of the current literature, the implications of this study for our understanding of HIV-1 spread in vivo, which aspects of in vivo physiology this integrated experimental-computational analysis takes into account, and how it can be further improved experimentally and in silico."
