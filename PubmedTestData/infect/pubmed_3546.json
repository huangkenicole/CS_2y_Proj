        "Thirty cohort pigs were followed from birth to slaughter to study epidemiological patterns of porcine pleuropneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The study was conducted within a larger 380-animal study of vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae in a 340-sow farrow-to-finish piggery with 4-month weaning, operating a continuous system of intensive production in the North Island of New Zealand. The cohort pigs were randomly allocated into two equal groups: vaccinated and control. Pigs in the first group were vaccinated at 2 and 4 weeks of age with both M. hyopneumoniae vaccine and A. pleuropneumoniae vaccine at separate vaccination sites. A series of nasal swabs was taken at 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 18 weeks of age. Each swab was streaked onto the surface of a selective medium on the farm and the plates were immediately transported to a laboratory and incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days. After the trial, pigs were slaughtered at an average of 132 days of age, lungs were examined and samples taken for bacteriological culture and isolation. Thirty-five out of 256 samples produced haemolytic colonies which were Gram-negative, V-factor-dependent and positive to the CAMP test. A. pleuropneumoniae was first isolated at 4 weeks of age from one vaccinated pig. This finding suggests that piglets became infected in the farrowing pen and the source of infection might be a carrier sow. The interval-specific cumulative incidence of A. pleuropneumoniae infection reached a maximum of 54% and 40% at 11 weeks of age in the vaccinated and control groups, respectively. Infection status of the litter is considered to be a factor influencing morbidity in infected herds during weaner and grower periods. Our results suggest that simultaneous vaccination with M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae vaccines at 2 and 4 weeks of age might lessen the prevalence but cannot absolutely prevent A. pleuropneumoniae infection during the weaner or grower-finisher periods."
