      "AbstractText": [
        "Red Sokoto goats aged four to five months were experimentally infected with the Nigerian strain of Wesselsbron virus. Viraemia commenced 24-72 hours after infection and lasted for 3-4 days. A febrile reaction which was mostly biphasic coincided with viraemia. A 50% mortality rate was observed among infected animals. The virus was re-isolated in mice from almost every tissue (liver, spleen, lungs, brain, kidney, adrenal, lymph node and heart) obtained from dead goats. Complement fixing antigens were detected in the tissues of dead goats, the titre of which correlated positively with the infectivity titre. All infected animals developed complement-fixing and haemagglutination inhibiting antibodies to Wesselsbron virus. However, neutralizing antibody was detected only in goats that survived the infection."
