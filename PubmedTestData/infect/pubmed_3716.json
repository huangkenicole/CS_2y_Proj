        "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) has a large global burden and in some key communities, such as Indigenous Australians living in remote areas, greater than 45% of people are infected. Despite HTLV-1 causing serious malignancy and myelopathic paraparesis, and a significant association with a range of inflammatory comorbidities and secondary infections that shorten lifespan, few biomedical interventions are available. HTLV-1 starkly contrasts with other blood-borne sexually transmitted viral infections, such as, HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus, with no antiviral treatments that reduce virus-infected cells, no rapid diagnostics or biomarker assays suitable for use in remote settings, and no effective vaccine. We review how the replication strategies and molecular properties of HTLV-1 establish a long-term stealthy viral pathogenesis through a fine-tuned balance of persistence, immune cell dysfunction, and proliferation of proviral infected cells that collectively present robust barriers to treatment and prevention. An understanding of the nature of the HTLV-1 provirus and opposing actions of viral-coded negative-sense HBZ and positive-sense regulatory proteins Tax, p12 and its cleaved product p8, and p30, is needed to improve the biomedical tools for preventing transmission and improving the long-term health of people with this lifelong infection."
