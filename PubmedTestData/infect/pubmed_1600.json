        "Prosthetic joint infection remains a devastating complication of arthroplasty associated with significant patient morbidity. The demand for arthroplasty is rapidly growing with a corresponding increase in the number of infections involving the prosthesis. The diagnosis and treatment of prosthetic joint infections presents a significant challenge to orthopaedic and infectious diseases clinicians.",
        "The underlying pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infections is due to the ability of the microorganisms to form a biofilm. The biofilm provides protection against host immune responses and antimicrobial therapy. In addition, it impedes standard laboratory diagnostic techniques. This review will examine new investigations to improve the diagnostic yield and rapidity of diagnosis of infections, including the use of sonication to disrupt the biofilm, new molecular tests to improve the detection of infecting microorganisms and new imaging techniques such as (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose PET.",
        "The successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections is dependent on eliminating the biofilm dwelling microorganisms whilst maintaining patient mobility and quality of life. This review will examine current understanding of management approaches for these infections, with a particular focus on antimicrobial therapy with activity against the biofilm, such as rifampicin and fluoroquinolones."
