      "AbstractText": [
        "The molecular mechanisms underlying biological differences between two <i>Leishmania</i> species that cause cutaneous disease, <i>L. major</i> and <i>L. amazonensis</i>, are poorly understood. In <i>L. amazonensis</i>, reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling drives differentiation of nonvirulent promastigotes into forms capable of infecting host macrophages. Tight spatial and temporal regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is key to this signaling mechanism, suggesting a role for ascorbate-dependent peroxidase (APX), which degrades mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Earlier studies showed that <i>APX</i>-null <i>L. major</i> parasites are viable, accumulate higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, generate a greater yield of infective metacyclic promastigotes, and have increased virulence. In contrast, we found that in <i>L. amazonensis</i>, the ROS-inducible APX is essential for survival of all life cycle stages. <i>APX</i>-null promastigotes could not be generated, and parasites carrying a single <i>APX</i> allele were impaired in their ability to infect macrophages and induce cutaneous lesions in mice. Similar to what was reported for <i>L. major</i>, APX depletion in <i>L. amazonensis</i> enhanced differentiation of metacyclic promastigotes and amastigotes, but the parasites failed to replicate after infecting macrophages. APX expression restored <i>APX</i> single-knockout infectivity, while expression of catalytically inactive APX drastically reduced virulence. APX overexpression in wild-type promastigotes reduced metacyclogenesis, but enhanced intracellular survival following macrophage infection or inoculation into mice. Collectively, our data support a role for APX-regulated mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in promoting differentiation of virulent forms in both <i>L. major</i> and <i>L. amazonensis</i> Our results also uncover a unique requirement for APX-mediated control of ROS levels for survival and successful intracellular replication of <i>L. amazonensis</i>."
