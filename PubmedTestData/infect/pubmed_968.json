        "Fresh or cryopreserved kidney tissue from goats suffering from heart water (Cowdria ruminantium infection) was infective when inoculated intravenously into susceptible goats. Primary kidney cell cultures were established from 14 goats reacting to C ruminantium infection; they were tested for infectivity by intravenous injection into susceptible goats after periods varying from five to 31 days. Three cultures, five, 12 and 13 days old, induced heartwater in recipients. The other 11 cultures, varying in age from six to 31 days, did not cause any reaction and all 11 recipient goats died from heartwater on challenge. C ruminantium could not be detected microscopically in the cell cultures."
