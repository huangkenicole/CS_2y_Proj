        "Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease, caused by septic vegetations and inflammatory foci on the surface of the endothelium and the valves. Due to its complex and often indecisive presentation the mortality rate is still about 30%. Most frequently bacterial microorganisms entering the bloodstream are the underlying origin of the intracardiac infection. While the disease was primarily restricted to younger patients suffering from rheumatic heart streptococci infections, new at risk categories for Staphylococcus (S.) aureus infections arose over the last years. Rising patient age, increasing drug resistance, intensive treatment conditions such as renal hemodialysis, immunosuppression and long term indwelling central venous catheters but also the application of modern cardiac device implants and valve prosthesis have led to emerging incidences of S. aureus IE in health care settings and community. The aetiologic change has impact on the pathophysiology of IE, the clinical presentation and the overall patient management. Despite intensive research on appropriate in vitro and in vivo models of IE and gained knowledge about the fundamental mechanisms in the formation of bacterial vegetations and extracardiac complications, improved understanding of relevant bacterial virulence factors and triggered host immune responses is required to help developing novel antipathogenic treatment strategies and pathogen specific diagnostic markers. In this review, we summarize and discuss the two main areas affected by the changing patient demographics and provide first, recent knowledge about the pathogenic strategies of S. aureus in the induction of IE, including available experimental models of IE used to study host-pathogen interactions and diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In a second focus we present diagnostic (imaging) regimens for patients with S. aureus IE according to current guidelines as well as treatment strategies and surgical recommendations."
