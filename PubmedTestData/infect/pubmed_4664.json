        "By intraperitoneal injection of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in Balb/c mice at doses of 2 X 10(6), 2 X 10(5) and 2 X 10(4) pfu per mouse, lethal, acute but non-lethal and asymptomatic infection were produced respectively. 100% mortality was found in mice infected with the lethal dose, as well as high MCMV titres in liver and spleen, severe necrosis of the spleen and severe degeneration of the liver. In these mice leukocyte counts in blood was not raised and inflammatory responses in the peritoneum, spleen and liver were not observed. Mice with acute but non-lethal infection showed less severe pathological changes, moderate spleen necrosis was followed by spleen enlargement. In this group of mice, severe mononucleosis was observed, and moderate inflammatory reactions were noted in the peritoneum, liver and spleen. Mice asymptomatically infected exhibited slight mononucleosis in the blood and splenomegaly."
