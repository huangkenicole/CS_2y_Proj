        "In northern Ghana and Togo, Oesophagostomum bifurcum infects an estimated 250,000 people, as determined by cultures of stool samples. The juvenile stages of the helminth develop within colonic wall nodules, causing Dapaong tumor or multinodular disease, at the rate of 1 case per week at Nalerigu Hospital in Ghana. Our aim was to discover whether suspected colonic-wall pathology is ultrasonographically visible in asymptomatic individuals living in the area where O. bifurcum is endemic. A total of 464 persons from 3 villages, ranging from highly infected to noninfected, were examined with ultrasonography. Anechogenic colonic lesions with posterior wall enhancement were observed in 71 (54.2%) of 131 and 57 (24.5%) of 233 persons from the villages of endemicity, and no lesions were seen in persons from the village outside the area of endemicity. We describe the lesions noted in this study as nodules caused by O. bifurcum, on the basis of their association at a population level with prevalence of larvae in stools, their expected ultrasonographic appearance and distribution (on the basis of our surgical experience with oesophagostomiasis), and the lack of a convincing differential diagnosis."
