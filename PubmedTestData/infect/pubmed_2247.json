        "Toxoplasma gondii infections have been reported in a number of marine mammals. Presently it is not known how these animals acquire T. gondii from their aquatic environment. The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, has been shown to remove Cryptosporidiwn oocysts from seawater and a similar phenomenon may be occurring with T. gondii oocysts and marine invertebrates. The present study was done to determine if eastern oysters could remove and retain T. gondii oocysts from seawater. Oocysts of the VEG strain of T. gondii (1 x 10(6) oocysts) were placed in seawater (32 ppt NaCl) containing live eastern oysters. The infected seawater was removed one day postinoculation (PI) and replaced with fresh seawater. Selected oysters were removed at 1, 3 and 6 days PI. Hemolymph, gill washes, and oyster tissue were collected separately at each observation time. The oyster tissue was homogenized and all 3 samples fed separately to mice. Toxoplasma gondii positive mice were observed at each time period. The results indicate that T. gondii oocysts can be removed from seawater by eastern oysters and retain their infectivity. Contaminated raw oysters may serve as a source of T. gondii infection for marine mammals and humans."
