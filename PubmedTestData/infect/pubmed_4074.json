        "A properly functioning immune system among others protects the organism against the development of infections. In certain situations, its activity can be impaired, which can result in an increased risk of viral and bacterial infection development. An aqueous extract of aloe arborescens (Aloe arborescens Mill.) has been used as add-on therapy for many years due to its immunomodulatory effect resulting in increased anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and anti-bacterial activity. This effect is mainly due to lectins (glycoproteins) and mannans (polysaccharides). Over the past years products containing the aqueous extract of aloe arborescens have been subjected to numerous studies in vitro as well as pharmacological investigations and clinical-observational studies. Based on literature data as well as on the results of observational studies carried out in Poland, a positive immunomodulating effect of Aloe extract containing products has been demonstrated. This effect manifested in infection's symptoms amelioration and infection time shortening but also in general immune system stimulation resulting in less frequent infection recurrence. In Poland the only registered medicinal products containing aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens as an active substance, are Bioaron\u00ae C and Biostymina\u00ae. Both products showed good efficacy and safety profiles both in adults and in children."
