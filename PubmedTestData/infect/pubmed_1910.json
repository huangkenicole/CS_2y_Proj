        "Antimicrobial drugs play an important, often central, role in the therapeutic management of mature horses and foals with a variety of illnesses, including those requiring critical care. Antimicrobial use must be based on rational principles involving thorough patient evaluation and sound clinical judgment that indicate a high likelihood that the patient has a bacterial infection and that antimicrobials are indicated to promote recovery. The aim of antimicrobial treatment is to inflict an insult on infecting bacteria sufficient to kill the organism or render it susceptible to inactivation by natural host defenses or the local microenvironment without adversely affecting the patient."
