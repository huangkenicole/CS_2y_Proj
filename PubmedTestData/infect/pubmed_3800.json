        "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) establishes persistent viral infections in the central nervous system and induces chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in susceptible mice. TMEV infects dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and glial cells. The state of TLR activation in the host plays a critical role in initial viral replication and persistence. The further activation of TLRs enhances viral replication and persistence, leading to the pathogenicity of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. Various cytokines are produced via TLRs, and MDA-5 signals linked with NF-\u03baB activation following TMEV infection. In turn, these signals further amplify TMEV replication and the persistence of virus-infected cells. The signals further elevate cytokine production, promoting the development of Th17 responses and preventing cellular apoptosis, which enables viral persistence. Excessive levels of cytokines, particularly IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, facilitate the generation of pathogenic Th17 immune responses to viral antigens and autoantigens, leading to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. These cytokines, together with TLR2 may prematurely generate functionally deficient CD25-FoxP3+ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are subsequently converted to Th17 cells. Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-17 synergistically inhibit the apoptosis of virus-infected cells and the cytolytic function of CD8+ T lymphocytes, prolonging the survival of virus-infected cells. The inhibition of apoptosis leads to the persistent activation of NF-\u03baB and TLRs, which continuously provides an environment of excessive cytokines and consequently promotes autoimmune responses. Persistent or repeated infections of other viruses such as COVID-19 may result in similar continuous TLR activation and cytokine production, leading to autoimmune diseases."
