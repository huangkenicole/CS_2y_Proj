        "The present communication reports on the attenuation of a pathogenic hemoflagellate, Cryptobia salmositica Katz (Sarcomastigophora: Kinetoplastida) and its use as a live vaccine against cryptobiosis. The parasite was attenuated by continuous in vitro culture (at 10 C for 55 wk) in minimum essential medium. Attenuated (culture) forms are morphologically similar to virulent (blood) forms. They are however more slender and have a shorter anterior flagellum and a smaller nucleus and kinetoplast. The attenuated form returned to its normal size and multiplied when inoculated into naive Oncorhynchus mykiss. It produced a low parasitemia but did not cause disease (e.g., no exophthalmia or anemia) in fish. At four wk after infection, the vaccinated fish were challenged with the virulent parasite. They were protected from the disease, whereas the control (naive) fish, infected with only the virulent parasite, had the usual clinical signs (e.g., anemia, exophthalmia). No parasite was detected in any of 10 vaccinated fish at 22 wk after challenge with the virulent parasite. However, 5 of 9 fish infected with culture forms and 6 of 9 fish infected with blood forms still had detectable parasites at 26 and 22 wk after infection, respectively."
