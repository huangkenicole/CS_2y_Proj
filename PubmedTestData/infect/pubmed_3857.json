        "Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus is now a worldwide pandemic, transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, particularly during heterosexual intercourse. Infection in adults is followed by an asymptomatic period that lasts several years, after which continued destruction of the immune system renders the individual susceptible to multiple opportunistic infections. Antiviral therapy has been shown to prolong patient survival. However, viral resistance has limited the options available to clinicians. Until a truly effective antiviral agent or immune-modulator is developed, efforts to change risky sexual practices will remain the most important resource in limiting the spread of this infection."
