        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-2019 is a new global health challenge which causes severe respiratory complications. As of May 17th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 4.6 million people and caused 310,000 deaths, worldwide. In order to study potential impact of infection, complete epidemiological information should be reported on regular basis however, data from Pakistan has not yet been published. This retrospective study is the first report of epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Faisalabad, Pakistan. On April 4th, 2020, 128 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from city Faisalabad were transported to Postgraduate Research Institute, Lahore for further processing. RNA was extracted using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit and real-time PCR was performed to quantify COVID-19. Our finding showed that overall prevalence of COVID-19 in Faisalabad on April 4th was 17.18% (22 of 128). Prevalence was higher in males (n\u00a0=\u00a017; 77.2%) as compared to females (n\u00a0=\u00a05; 22.8%) but this gender-wise difference was not statistically significant. Patients belonging to age group 37-47\u00a0years were found to be most (45.5%) infected with COVID-19."
