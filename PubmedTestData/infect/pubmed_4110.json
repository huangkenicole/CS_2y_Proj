        "The course of infection with Giardia was studied in (a) naturally infected cats and (b) experimentally infected Mongolian gerbils using Giardia cysts isolated from cats. Natural infection was characterized by: (a) a latent period of 11 to 13 days, (b) the pattern of cyst release which was either continuous or intermittent during the acute phase of infection and (c) elimination of the infection in four to five weeks after exposure. Mongolian gerbils were found to be susceptible to infection with Giardia isolated from cats. The course of infection in gerbils was characterized by intermittent cyst release and elimination of the infection in about three weeks. The pattern of cyst release in gerbils infected with Giardia isolated from cats was similar to the previously reported pattern of cyst release in gerbils infected with Giardia isolated from humans. The possible role of pets in the zoonotic transmission of giardiasis is discussed."
