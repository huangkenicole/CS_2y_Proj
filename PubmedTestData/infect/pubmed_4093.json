        "Cryptosporidia and microsporidia are emerging parasitic pathogens in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium infects several wild and domestic animals that excrete oocysts into the environment and contaminated water represents the major source of infection for humans. Waterborne transmission of Cryptosporidium is a major risk for humans and appropriate measures have to be taken to protect immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals to become infected. For microsporidia, the sources and ways of transmission are not well documented. Although several animal hosts have been identified recently, the relevant reservoirs of human microsporidia are still unknown. Also, the routes of spreading are unknown. Is microsporidiosis a zoonotic disease that will be transmitted through close contact with infected animals or is contaminated surface water responsible for transmission and represents a relevant reservoir? This review is designed to give information on these two emerging intestinal parasites in a format that will be useful to clinical microbiologists, physicians interested in infectious diseases, and public health personnel."
