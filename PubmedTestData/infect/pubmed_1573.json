      "AbstractText": [
        "Four Merino lambs were intranasally inoculated with bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5) reference strain N569. Two lambs were mock-inoculated as negative controls. The virus-inoculated animals developed apathy, inappetence, rhinitis, nasal, ocular and genital discharge, slight diarrhea and neurological disorders, like tremor and salivation. BHV-5 was isolated from the nasal discharge in two of the animals, while the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the virus in all the infected lambs. Two lambs died on post infection day (PID) 13, while the other two infected animals were euthanized on PID 15 and 30. Gross pathological changes were not observed, however, histopathological examinations revealed diffuse nonsuppurative meningo-encephalitis in all infected animals. Viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry and viral nucleic acid was revealed by in situ hybridization in the brain of the two lambs, which died on PID 13. The virus was demonstrated by virus isolation and by PCR from different organs of all the infected animals. Slight rise of antibodies was observed in the infected animals from PID 15. The results show that BHV-5 is able to cross the species barrier and may establish infection in sheep."
