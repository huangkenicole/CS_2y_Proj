        "Cauda equina syndrome is caused by compression or injury to the nerve roots distal to the level of the spinal cord. This syndrome presents as low back pain, motor and sensory deficits in the lower extremities, and bladder as well as bowel dysfunction. Although various etiologies of cauda equina syndrome have been reported, a less common cause is infection.",
        "To report a case of cauda equina syndrome caused by infection of an intradural extramedullary abscess with Staphylococcus aureus.",
        "Case report and review of the literature.",
        "The literature regarding the infectious causes of cauda equina syndrome was reviewed and a case of cauda equina syndrome caused by infection of an intradural extramedullary abscess with Staphylococcus aureus was reported.",
        "A 37-year-old woman, with history of intravenous drug abuse, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B, presented with low back pain lasting 2 months, lower extremity pain, left greater than right with increasing weakness and difficulty ambulating, and urinary and fecal incontinence. Her presentation was consistent with cauda equina syndrome. The patient underwent a T12-L2 laminectomy, and intradural exploration revealed an abscess. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was found on wound culture.",
        "Cauda equina syndrome, presenting as a result of spinal infection, such as the case reported here, is extremely rare but clinically important. Surgical intervention is generally the recommended therapeutic modality."
