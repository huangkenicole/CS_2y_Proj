        "The pathogenesis of dermatophytoses is associated with the secretion of enzymes degrading the infected tissue components. Although many studies on enzymatic activity of dermatophytes have been conducted over the years, there have been no concrete proposals on the construction of the profile of enzymes characteristic of individual species, genus or ecological types of dermatophytes. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of clinical dermatophyte isolates from both symptomatic and asymptomatic animals and humans to produce different enzymes.",
        "Clinical isolates of 234 dermatophyte strains collected during routine examination of animal health were used in this study. The enzymatic production of keratinase, elastase, phospholipase, lipase, protease, DNase and gelatinase as well as the haemolytic activity were evaluated using specific test media. The overall degree of enzymatic activity of the analysed clinical isolates of the dermatophytes was 67%. All tested clinical isolates of different species of dermatophytes showed keratinase activity and 96% additionally exhibited phospholipase activity. The weakest activity among the tested enzymes was demonstrated for elastase and gelatinase. 83% of the isolates of the dermatophytes showed haemolytic activity.",
        "Our data indicate that clinical isolates of dermatophytes from different species produce enzymes with different levels of activities.",
        "Profile of enzymes characteristic of individual species, genus or ecological types of dermatophytes is possibly dependent upon factors related to the host. The relationship between each enzyme and the occurrence of skin lesions in animals and humans or asymptomatic animal carriers varies on whether the infection is caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton verrucosum or Microsporum canis. Interestingly, only keratinase seems to be correlated with the appearance of dermatophyte infections, irrespective of the pathogen species, and elastase is a characteristic enzyme for dermatophyte strains infecting humans. Haemolysis seems to be dependent on host factors and is more common in the case of human dermatophyte isolates."
