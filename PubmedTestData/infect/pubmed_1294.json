        "Experimental mixed infection was reproduced in rabbits after per os infection with Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 0:3 cells. Four days later some of animals were re-infected orally with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b cells. A third group of healthy rabbits was also infected per os with Listeria monocytogenes. The infectious process was followed dynamically from days 1-28. The experimental animals were examined for clinical, paraclinical and morphological findings. Augmentation of body temperature and alveolar macrophage number, a decreased number of peritoneal macrophages, leucopenia as well as purulent meningoencephalitis, catarrhal pneumonia, lienitis, lymphadenitis and enteritis were detected after experimental mixed infection. Both types of macrophages demonstrated a weak bactericidal activity against Yersinia enterocolitica and a highly expressed killing effect against Listeria monocytogenes. Yersinia and Listeria cells were isolated from the viscera and brain. Both species of bacteria were established intracellularly in the macrophages by electron-microscopic examination. The data received showed that mixed Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and Listeria monocytogenes 4b infection of rabbits runs with transitory hyperthermia as a generalized infection and is similar to the Listeria mono-infection. The immunosuppressive effect induced by oral Yersinia enterocolitica infection of rabbits promotes the expression of listerious agents."
