        "Sporozoan schizonts were seen in histologic sections of cerebrum from a Hereford calf that died immediately after birth. Schizonts appeared in endothelial cells of small vessels in the gray and white matter. Rosette and palisade configurations of merozoites in schizonts, as well as the size of schizonts (15 to 40 X 21 microns) and merozoites (8 microns), resembled Sarcocystis stages described in cattle, and differentiated the organisms from Toxoplasma that infects nerve cells and undergoes endodyogeny. Specific identification of the infecting agent was not successful because tests of sera from the calf were not possible. Developmental, morphologic, and ultrastructural differences in schizogonic stages of the heteroxenous sporozoan species infecting cattle are poorly known and are presently unreliable criteria for species identification. Encephalitis, meningitis, and necrosis occurred in cerebral, cerebellar, and brain stem gray and white matter infiltrated with plasmacytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Microthrombi were often seen in small blood vessels within the reaction foci. Herd-mate sera tested against S cruzi were negative. The herd from which the calf was born was exposed to a variety of free-ranging domestic, feral, and wild scavengers with free access to dead range animals. Consequently, the cattle were undoubtedly exposed to infective cysts in feed or water contaminated by feces from carnivores."
