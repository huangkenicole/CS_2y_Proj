        "To explore the sero-prevalence and risk factors for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection and unprotected sexual behavior in an ethnically diverse population of HIV-infected subjects in a county of Yunnan province.",
        "HIV-infected individuals attending for routine follow-up by local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were recruited to participate in the study under 'informed consent'. A face-to-face questionnaire interview was administered to each participant. Blood was drawn for HSV-2 testing by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA (Focus Diagnostics) and CD(4)(+) T counting.",
        "A total of 300 HIV-infected individuals participated in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 37.6 years with 76.7% as males. Ethnically, Han, Dai and Jingpo accounted for 44.3%, 37.3% and 16.0% of the sample, respectively. Half of the subjects reported HIV acquisition through injection drug use. The sero-prevalence of HSV-2 was 35.0%. Results from multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that individuals who acquired HIV through heterosexual contact were more likely to be HSV-2 positive than those who acquired HIV through injection drug use (OR = 4.244, 95%CI: 1.924 - 9.364), whereas Dai (OR = 0.300, 95%CI: 0.152 - 0.593) and Jingpo (OR = 0.376, 95%CI: 0.167 - 0.850) were less likely to be HSV-2 positive than the Hans. Among 105 people who were co-infected with HIV/HSV-2, 60 had sexual intercourses in the past 3 months and 41.7% of them reported no or inconsistent use of condoms. Most unprotected sexual contacts occurred within married couples.",
        "HSV-2 infection was highly prevalent among HIV-infected individuals in this county, and a significant proportion of HIV/HSV-2 co-infected subjects engaged in unprotected sex. HSV-2 testing, behavioral and biomedical interventions among HIV-infected individuals and their sexual partners should be involved in the local HIV prevention and control programs."
