        "Lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) enters and infects the gill cells of flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) via a 27.8\u00a0kDa membrane protein receptor. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to locate the tissue distribution of this molecule in healthy flounder and showed that it was widely distributed in the tissues tested. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the expression of the receptor in healthy flounder was highest in the gills and stomach, then in the skin, intestine and liver, followed by the spleen, head kidney, heart, ovary and brain\u00a0and finally the kidney. On LCDV infection, ELISA indicated that the expression of the receptor, as determined by ELISA, was significantly upregulated in all tissues of LCDV-infected flounder compared with controls, but this expression decreased over the 4 weeks post infection. In contrast, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the copy number of the LCDV gene in the tissues increased with time post infection, and that viral loads were higher in the tissues with higher expressions of the receptor. These results point to a correlation between high expression of the 27.8\u00a0kDa receptor and efficient LCDV propagation. The wide tissue distribution of the receptor might be one reason why LCDV can infect various tissues leading to systemic infection."
