        "Studies were done on laboratory-raised Rana pipiens tadpoles experimentally infected with Echinostoma trivolvis cercariae. Tadpoles exposed individually to 250 cercariae died within 24 h. They were edematous at death and their kidneys were heavily infected with metacercarial cysts. Of 20 tadpoles exposed to 100 cercariae each, 9 survived the infection, and their growth was compared for 4 weeks postinfection (p.i.) with that of 20 control tadpoles that had not been exposed to cercariae. There was a significant weekly decline in the total length and body weight of the infected versus control tadpoles. Surviving tadpoles retained their metacercarial infections in the kidneys following metamorphosis to frogs. Following exposure of tadpoles to cercariae, cercarial bodies were first seen in the kidneys by 0.5 h p.i. Metacercariae that were molding their inner and outer cyst walls were first seen at 2.3 h, and by 8.5 h the inner and outer cyst walls were clearly defined. Domestic chicks exposed to cysts aged 2.5 and 4.0 h did not become infected, whereas ovigerous adults of E. trivolvis were recovered from chicks fed 12-h-old cysts. Cercariae aged 6 to 8 h were more infective to tadpoles than were either 1- or 20-h-old cercariae. The E. trivolvis-R pipiens tadpole model is suitable for the study of host-parasite relationships of echinostome larvae in a cold-blooded vertebrate host."
