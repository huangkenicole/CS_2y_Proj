        "Vector competence of autogenous and anautogenous Culex pipiens; derived from North Sinai Governorate, Egypt, for the human filaria parasite Wuchereria bancrofti was studied. After feeding on the same microfilaremic volunteers both biotypes were readily infected with the parasite (infection rates > 80%) and supported its development to the infective stage within 11 - 12 days. Infective rates of both autogenous and anautogenous mosquitoes were similar (> 95%). However, autogenous Cx. pipiens developed significantly less number of infective stage larvae (4.7 +/- 1.4 L3 / female) than did anautogenous siblings (6.7 +/- 3.6 L3 / female) (P < 0.05). Moreover, autogenous females were observed to contain twice the number of L3 larvae in the thoracic muscles and less larvae in the head region compared to autogenous counterparts. Vector competence characteristics of Cx. pipiens derived from a filariasis endemic area in Qalubiya Governorate were similar to those of anautogenous mosquitoes of North Sinai. These findings indicate that autogenous Cx. pipiens may be less efficient vector of W. bancrofti in endemic areas of Egypt."
