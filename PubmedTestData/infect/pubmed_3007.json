        "The long-term effects of antimicrobial-stewardship programs in the intensive care units (ICUs) have not been adequately examined. We evaluated the impact of an online comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship program (OCASP) on the outcomes of patients in 200-bed medical/surgical ICUs over the course of 11\u00a0years.",
        "We analyzed the records of adult patients admitted to ICUs during the 5\u00a0years before (n\u00a0=\u00a027,499) and the 6\u00a0years after (n\u00a0=\u00a033,834) implementation of an OCASP. Antimicrobial consumption, expenditures, duration of treatment, incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), prevalence of HAIs caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains, and crude or sepsis-related mortality of patients were analyzed. Segmented regression analyses of interrupted time series were used to assess the significance of changes in antimicrobial use.",
        "Compared to the patients in the pre-OCASP period, the patients in the post-OCASP period were older, had greater disease severity, longer ICU stays, and were more likely to receive antimicrobials, but had lower antimicrobial expenditures and crude and sepsis-related mortality. The trend of overall antimicrobial use [slope of defined daily dose/1000 patient-days vs. time) increased significantly before OCASP implementation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but decreased significantly after implementation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The administration duration of all classes of antibiotics were significantly shorter (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the incidences of HAIs were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) after implementation. However, there was an increase in the proportion of HAIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii relative to all A. baumannii infections.",
        "Implementation of an OCASP in the ICUs reduced antimicrobial consumption and expenditures, but did not compromise healthcare quality."
