        "Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, exploit type III secretion systems (T3SSs) through which virulence proteins are delivered into the host cytosol to reinforce invasive and replicative niches in their host. Although many secreted effector proteins and membrane-bound structural proteins in the T3SS have been characterized, the functions of many cytoplasmic proteins still remain unknown. In this study, we found that IacP, encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1, was important for nonphagocytic cell invasion and bacterial virulence. When the iacP gene was deleted from several Salmonella serovar Typhimurium strains, the invasion into INT-407 epithelial cells was significantly decreased compared to that of their parental strains, and retarded rearrangements of actin fibers were observed for the iacP mutant-infected cells. Although IacP had no effect on the secretion of type III translocon proteins, the levels of secretion of the effector proteins SopB, SopA, and SopD into the culture medium were decreased in the iacP mutant. In a mouse infection model, mice infected with the iacP mutant exhibited alleviated pathological signs in the intestine and survived longer than did wild-type-infected mice. Taken together, IacP plays a key role in Salmonella virulence by regulating the translocation of T3SS effector proteins."
