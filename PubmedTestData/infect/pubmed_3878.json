        "Vascular graft infections are one of the most dreaded complications in vascular surgery. They may present a few months to many years following insertion of a bypass graft but are most prevalent in those patients with groin incisions. The most commonly infecting organism is Staphylococcus arising from the patient's skin. Presentation may be one of massive bleeding if one of the graft anastomoses is involved in the septic process (peri-anastomotic sepsis) or one of vague malaise and fever if the graft but not the anastomosis is involved (peri-graft sepsis). Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, treatment includes removal of the infected graft with reconstruction of the vascular system through one of a variety of methods. These controversies are discussed."
