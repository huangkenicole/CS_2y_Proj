        "Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) is an antigenic variant of avian paramyxovirus type 1, which mainly infects pigeons. Here, we characterized ten PPMV-1 viruses isolated from pigeons in China during 1996-2019. Phylogenetic analysis of available complete genomes, F and HN genes of PPMV-1 from China showed that multiple PPMV-1 genotypes (I, II, VI, and VII) exist in pigeons in China. Ten PPMV-1 viruses isolated in this study belonged to genotypes VI.1.2.2.2, VI.2.1.1.2.1, VI.2.1.1.2.2 and VII respectively. Genotype VI is predominant in pigeons. VI.2.1.1.2.2 contains most recently isolated PPMV-1 viruses, suggesting that VI.2.1.1.2.2 is a prevalent genotype in pigeons in China. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that four representative viruses from genotypes VI.2.1.1.2.1 (TA14), VI.2.1.1.2.2 (SD19), VI.1.2.2.2 (SD16), and VII (JN08) could replicate efficiently in chicken embryo fibroblasts, while the replication titer of JN08 (VII) virus was significantly lower than that of VI gene viruses in pigeon embryo fibroblasts. The TA14 (VI.2.1.1.2.1) and SD19 (VI.2.1.1.2.2) viruses caused 20 % and 30 % mortality in pigeons, respectively. No birds infected with SD16 (VI.1.2.2.2) died during the study period. JN08 (VII) virus did not cause obvious clinical signs in infected pigeons. All data indicated that VI.2.1.1.2.2 is the prevalent genotype circulating in China and poses a major threat to pigeons, suggesting that a matched vaccine is necessary to control the disease."
