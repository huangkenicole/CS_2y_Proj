        "Kerstersia gyiorum is an extremely rare pathogen of human infection. It can cause chronic infection in patients with underlying conditions. It can easily be misdiagnosed if proper diagnostic methods are not used.",
        "A 47-year-old male patient with a history of Buerger's Disease for 28\u00a0years presented to our hospital with an infected chronic wound on foot. The wound was debrided, and the specimen was sent to Microbiology laboratory. Gram staining of the specimen showed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes and gram-negative bacilli. Four types of colonies were isolated on blood agar. These were identified as Kerstersia gyiorum, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii by Maldi Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The identification of K. gyiorum was confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patient was successfully recovered with antimicrobial therapy, surgical debridement, and skin grafting.",
        "This is the first case of wound infection due to K. gyiorum in a patient with Buerger's Disease. We made a brief review of K. gyiorum cases up to date. Also, this case is presented to draw attention to the use of new and advanced methods like MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for identification of rarely isolated species from clinical specimens of patients with chronic infections and with chronic underlying conditions."
