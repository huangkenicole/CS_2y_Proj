        "We examined the impact of different Oesophagostomum dentatum dose levels and durations of infection on the development and infectivity of the following generation. Pigs were trickle-infected with 200, 2,000 or 20,000 L3/week over 20 weeks. Egg hatch assays were performed at monthly intervals; however, no consistent differences were found between any of the dose groups in the development of eggs into first-stage larvae. To compare larval infectivity, larvae were derived from faecal cultures set up from the low- and the high-dose groups in the early and the late part of the experiment, and were inoculated into helminth-free pigs (5,000 L3/pig). Worm establishments were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the group of pigs receiving larvae derived early in the experiment from the low-dose group compared with the two groups receiving larvae from high-dose groups, thus indicating an adverse effect of high doses of trickle infection on the later infectivity of L3 larvae derived from excreted eggs."
