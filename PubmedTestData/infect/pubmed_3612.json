        "Asymptomatic Entamoeba histolytica infections in pregnant women puts infants at risk of infection through vertical transmission or transmission during breastfeeding in high HIV prevalence areas. The study aimed at investigating the immune response to asymptomatic E.histolytica infection in pregnant women and their infants in a high HIV burdened setting in Harare, Zimbabwe.",
        "Serum samples from 39 predominantly breastfeeding mother-infant pairs were analyzed for inflammatory cytokine and immunoglobulin profiles using BIOPLEX. The infants' ages ranged from 10 days to 14 weeks.",
        "IL-1r, IL-4, IL-9, IL-12p70, IL-17a, G-CSF and PDGF-BB were significantly raised in E. histolytica infected compared to non-infected lactating mothers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Carriage of any form of enteric infection such as Non-lactose fermenters (NLFs) including E. histolytica significantly increased concentration levels of IL-1r, IL-4, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL17a, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, PDGF-BB and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but no significant differences in immunoglobulin levels among the mothers. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1r, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-9, IL-12-p70, IL-15, IL-17a, TNF-\u03b1) and growth factors (FGF-\u03b2, G-CSF, GM-CSF, PDGF-bb) were significantly raised in HIV-uninfected mothers and not HIV-infected mothers during E. histolytica infection (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In infants, E. histolytica carriage and HIV exposure had no significant impact on the cytokine and immunoglobulin concentrations.",
        "Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are highly raised in lactating mothers with asymptomatic enteric pathogens hence there is need to check cytokine profiles in pregnant women and their infants to assist in decision making linked to treatment and prevention in times of pandemics."
