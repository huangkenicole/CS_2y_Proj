        "Gemella are gram-positive bacteria that rarely cause infective endocarditis (IE). This article summarizes the characteristics of a series of patients with Gemella IE. We identified cases of Gemella IE in patients aged >18\u202fyears old hospitalized at Cleveland Clinic between July 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018, within the institutional review board-approved Cleveland Clinic IE Registry. Clinical features were obtained by manual chart review. Thirteen cases of Gemella IE were identified and accounted for <1% of all cases of IE in the registry. Eight were native and 5 were prosthetic valve IE. All were left-sided. Sixty-nine percent had positive blood cultures for Gemella, but 31% were identified solely based on 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of explanted valves with sequence identification. None had positive valve cultures. All were treated surgically and survived to hospital discharge. Gemella is a rare cause of IE, albeit likely underrecognized without utilization of valve PCR."
