      "AbstractText": [
        "During a 12-month surveillance period in 1981-1982, Moraxella catarrhalis was detected in cultures from nasopharyngeal aspirates from 76 (17%) of 449 children hospitalized with middle or lower respiratory tract infection. Seroconversion to M. catarrhalis was positive in 4 (5%) of the 76 patients with M. catarrhalis present in nasopharyngeal aspirates and in 4 (1%) of 373 patients with a negative finding. Although children with respiratory tract infections were often colonized by the organism, this was rarely the infective agent of the middle or lower airways. Four of 8 patients with seroconversion to M. catarrhalis exhibited a concomitant RSV infection. The carriage of this species was more closely associated with parainfluenza virus infections. Serological responses to M. catarrhalis were not associated with acute otitis media, and were also rare in children with pneumonia. It is concluded that bronchopulmonary infections caused by M. catarrhalis are rare in children, and that M. catarrhalis aetiology need not be considered in the selection of antibiotics in cases of community-acquired pneumonia or other infections of the middle or lower respiratory tract affecting primarily healthy children."
