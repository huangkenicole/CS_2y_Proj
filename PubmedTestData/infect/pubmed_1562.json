        "Major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (IE) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. The influence of proinflammatory conditions on development of IE is unknown. We studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental IE. Leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental IE. IE susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. The catheter did not predispose for IE by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. To mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. Interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased IE incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible Streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. IE due to the Streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. We conclude that proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to IE due to the platelet releasate-susceptible S. oralis. As with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for IE in humans at risk for this serious infection."
