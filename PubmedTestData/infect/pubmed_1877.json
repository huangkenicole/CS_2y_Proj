        "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major cause of upper respiratory disease in cats and is often used as a model for human norovirus, making it of great veterinary and human medical importance. However, questions remain regarding the route of entry of FCV <i>in vivo</i>. Increasing work has shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be active in viral infectivity, yet there is no work examining the role of EVs in FCV infection. Here, we begin to address this knowledge gap by characterizing EVs produced by a feline mammary epithelial cell line (FMEC). We have confirmed that EVs are produced by infected and mock-infected FMECs and that both virions and EVs are coisolated with standard methods of virus purification. We also show that they can be enriched differentially by continuous iodixanol density gradient. EVs were enriched at a density of 1.10 g/mL confirmed by tetraspanin expression, size profile, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Maximum enrichment of FCV at a density of 1.18 g/mL was confirmed by titration, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (q-RT PCR), and TEM. However, infectious virus was recovered from nearly all samples. When used to infect <i>in vitro</i> epithelium, both EV-rich and virus-rich fractions had the same levels of infectiousness as determined by percentage of wells infected or titer achieved postinfection. These findings highlight the importance of coisolates during viral purification, showing that EVs may represent a parallel route of entry that has previously been overlooked. Additional experiments are necessary to explore the role of EVs in FCV infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common cause of upper respiratory infection in cats. Both healthy and infected cells produce small particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are nanoparticles that act as messengers between cells and can be hijacked during viral infection. Historically, the role of EVs in viral infection has been overlooked, and subsequently no group has studied the role of EVs in FCV infection. We hypothesized that EVs may play a role in FCV infection. Here, we show that EVs are copurified with FCV when collecting virus. To study their individual effects, we successfully enrich for viral particles and EVs separately by taking advantage of their different densities. Our initial studies show that EV-enriched versus virus-enriched fractions are equally able to infect cells in culture. These findings highlight the need to both consider the purity of virus after purification and to further study EVs' role in natural FCV infection."
