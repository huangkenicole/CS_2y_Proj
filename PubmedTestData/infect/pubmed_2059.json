        "In New Zealand, the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the major wildlife reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis. Procedures for experimentally infecting possums are required to study the pathogenesis of the disease and to challenge possums in vaccine efficacy studies. Conjunctival instillation of a suspension of M. bovis was effective in producing bovine tuberculosis in captive possums. The experimental disease progressed slowly with the development of palpable lesions in superficial lymph node lesions, both characteristics of the disease in wild, naturally infected possums. At necropsy there was widespread distribution of macroscopic and microscopic lesions. The proportion of possums that became diseased, the rate of development and severity of lesions, the severity of clinical signs, all increased when the dose of M. bovis was increased. Of the three doses used, the medium dose (1000-2000 colony forming units) produced the disease with the most desired characteristics. As a procedure for exposing possums to infection with M. bovis the conjunctival route has advantages in that it is simple and safe to perform, and possums need only to be sedated for infection."
