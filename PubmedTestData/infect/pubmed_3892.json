      "AbstractText": [
        "Asian Taenia saginata, tentatively called Taenia saginata taiwanensis, has been described to be infected in its metacestode stage only in the liver of intermediate host animals. Experimentally, however, we found that the metacestodes of the Asian Taenia saginata are also infected in other viscera than the liver of pigs (Landrace-Duroc-Hampshire) 4 days to 4 months postinoculation (PI). Viscerotropism of cysticercosis was apparent because a majority (70.7%) of the non-calcified cysticerci were found in the livers while a minority were found in extrahepatic organs such as the omentum (19.2%), lungs (8.1%) and serosa of colon (2.0%). When experimentally infected to cattle, Asian T. saginata cysticerci were also observed calcified in the livers. On the other hand, classical Taenia saginata metacestodes infected the muscles and viscera of the Holstein-Friesian cattle whereas no infection was observed in experimental pigs. Extrahepatic metacestodes of Asian T. saginata, which were obtained from an experimental pig were confirmed to be infective to a male volunteer. This extrahepatic viscerotropism of Asian T. saginata metacestodes in experimental pigs explains well the transmission modes of Asian T. saginata among people considering the eating habits."
