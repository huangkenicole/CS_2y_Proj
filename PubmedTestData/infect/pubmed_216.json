        "To determine whether gerbils can be used as a suitable animal model for giardiasis, we attempted to infect Mongolian gerbils with cysts of Giardia lamblia isolated from the stools of 10 humans with symptomatic and asymptomatic giardiasis. We obtained 100% infection with one isolate (CDC:0284:1), as evidenced by the presence of numerous trophozoites in the intestines of the gerbil and cysts in the feces. Cysts from four patients were not infective, while cysts from the other five patients produced infections in 11 to 75% of the animals. On the basis of these and other experiments, we concluded that (i) only certain isolates of human G. lamblia infect gerbils, colonize the intestine, and complete their life cycle by undergoing differentiation into cysts; (ii) the infection could last for about 39 days, but the animals excreted maximum numbers of cysts on about day 13 postinfection; (iii) the pattern of cyst excretion was irregular, and some gerbils, like humans, excreted cysts intermittently; (iv) the minimum number of cysts needed to establish an infection in 50% of the gerbils was 100; and (v) only certain strains retained the ability to infect gerbils even after repeated animal passage."
