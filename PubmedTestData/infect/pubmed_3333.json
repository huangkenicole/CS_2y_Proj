      "AbstractText": [
        "35 patients were secondarily infected in our hospital with a strain of A. calcoaceticus resistant to the usual antibiotics and sulfonamides, but sensitive to colimycin. The epidemic lasted 118 days and is not yet finished. Each of the infected patients had a severe surgical or medical illness, underwent operations, trachetomy, etc. and was treated with antibiotics. A. calcoaceticus persisted alone or was associated with other bacteria from 1 to 46 days, in specimens (sputum, etc. or in blood) sometimes until death. It is not pathogenic for rabbits and mice; its pathogenicity in man is discussed in the text. The epidemic strain was not harboured by 15 doctors, students or nurses, nor present on 147 objects in the vicinity of the patients, but was found in a bottle of aqueous 1% eosin solution in the room of an infected child. Experiments show that A. calcoaceticus is not killed by a 1% eosin solution, and freely multiplies in broth containing 0,5% eosin. It is easy to identify the first case and chronology of the epidemic, but it is less easy to identify each time the means of propagation. Usually, infected patients seem to be the source of further infection. Does eosin paly more than an occasional role? Were the germs transported by dust? This not very disturbing epidemic suggests that less pathogenic germs may still cause unsuspected hospital epidemics."
