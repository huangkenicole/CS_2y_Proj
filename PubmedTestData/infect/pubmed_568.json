        "The \"enteric\" virus group comprises greater than 100 different viruses. These viruses typically infect the cell lining of the alimentary canal and are discharged in very large numbers in the feces of infected persons. Contamination of water supplies by enteric viruses represents an important source of viral infection. Many communities, particularly in developing countries, depend on sewage-polluted sources for their recreational and drinking water. Because conventional methods of sewage and water treatment have proved inefficient in the removal and inactivation of most enteric viruses, great concern has been raised over the impact of waterborne infection on the health of such communities. Current evidence implicating drinking and recreational water supplies in the transmission of nonbacterial gastroenteritis and hepatitis A virus and adenovirus infections is overwhelming. Water-borne transmission of other enteric viruses is also possible. Effective antiviral drugs are generally unavailable, and current vaccines can control only a limited number of viral infections; therefore, provision of uncontaminated water is a basic requirement in raising the standard of health in affected communities."
