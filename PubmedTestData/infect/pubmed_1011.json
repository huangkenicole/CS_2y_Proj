        "Evaluate the infectivity of Alphavirus Chikungunya and Mayaro in blood products in plaque forming units (UFP/ml).",
        "Arboviruses are responsible for sporadic diseases or epidemics which cause serious public health issues. Due to the high number of asymptomatic infections and high viremia, blood donors may pass on these viruses by transfusion.",
        "This study used blood bags that would be discarded after evaluation and certification of the absence of infections. The blood products obtained by centrifuging a unit of whole blood were called blood components. All blood bags were infected with viable viruses (previously quantified) compatible with Chikungunya and Mayaro viremia.",
        "Blood bags inoculated with both Chikungunya and Mayaro viruses were able to keep infective viruses during the processing of blood products (red blood cell concentrate, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) and also after the recommended storage for each component, which may infect individuals transfused with those.",
        "The results indicate that in order to prevent infections by Mayaro and Chikungunya viruses in blood products it is necessary to stimulate the development and use of diagnostic tests for these pathogens in donated blood."
