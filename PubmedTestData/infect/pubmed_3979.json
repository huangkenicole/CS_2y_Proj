      "AbstractText": [
        "A novel genus within the <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i> family was identified in the United States and named influenza D virus (IDV). Bovines have been proposed to be the primary host, and three main viral lineages (D/OK-like, D/660-like, and D/Japan-like) have been described. Experimental infections had previously been performed in swine, ferrets, calves, and guinea pigs in order to study IDV pathogenesis. We developed a murine experimental model to facilitate the study of IDV pathogenesis and the immune response. DBA/2 mice were inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 (D/OK-like). No clinical signs or weight loss were observed. Viral replication was observed mainly in the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates) but also in the lower respiratory tract of infected mice, with a peak at 4\u2009days postinfection. Moreover, the virus was also detected in the intestines. All infected mice seroconverted by 14\u2009days postinfection. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that IDV induced the activation of proinflammatory genes, such as gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and CCL2. Inoculation of NF-\u03baB-luciferase and Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrated that IDV induced mild inflammation and that a type I interferon response was not necessary in IDV clearance. Adaptation of IDV by serial passages in mice was not sufficient to induce disease or increased pathogenesis. Taken together, present data and comparisons with the calf model show that our mouse model allows for the study of IDV replication and fitness (before selected viruses may be inoculated on calves) and also of the immune response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Influenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of <i>Orthomyxoviridae</i> family, presents a large host range and a worldwide circulation. The pathogenicity of this virus has been studied in the calf model. The mouse model is frequently used to enable a first assessment of a pathogen<b>'</b>s fitness, replication, and pathogenesis for influenza A and B viruses. We showed that DBA/2 mice are a relevant <i>in vivo</i> model for the study of IDV replication. This model will allow for rapid IDV fitness and replication evaluation and will enable phenotypic comparisons between isolated viruses. It will also allow for a better understanding of the immune response induced after IDV infection."
