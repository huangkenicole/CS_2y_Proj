        "There are different views on which of the two forms of viral spread is more efficient in vivo between cell-free and cell-associated virus. In this study, discrete time human immunodeficiency virus models are formulated and analysed with the goal of determining the form of viral spread that is more efficient in vivo. It is shown that on its own, cell-free viral spread cannot sustain an infection owing to the low infectivity of cell-free virus and cell-associated virus can sustain an infection because of the high infectivity of cell-associated virus. When acting concurrently, cell-associated virus is more efficient in spreading the infection upon exposure to the virus. However, in the long term, the two forms of viral spread contribute almost equally. Both forms of viral spread are shown to be able to initiate an infection."
