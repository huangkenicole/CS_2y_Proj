        "In all living species, pH regulation is a tightly controlled process, with a plethora of proteins involved in its regulation. These include sodium-proton exchangers, carbonic anhydrases, anion exchangers, bicarbonate transporters/cotransporters, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, and monocarboxylate transporters. All of them play crucial roles in acid-base balancing, both in eukaryotic as well as in prokaryotic organisms, making them interesting drug targets for the management of pathological events (in)directly involved in pH regulation. Areas covered: Interfering with pH regulation for the treatment of tumors and microbial infections is the main focus of this review, with particular attention paid to inhibitors targeting the above-mentioned proteins. The latest advances in each field id reviewed. Expert opinion: Interfering with the pH regulation of tumor cells is a validated approach to tackle primary tumors and metastases growth. Carbonic anhydrases are the most investigated proteins of those aforementioned, with several inhibitors in clinical development. Recent advances in the characterization of proteins involved in pH homeostasis of various pathogens evidenced their crucial role in the survival and virulence of bacterial, fungal, and protozoan microorganisms. Some encouraging results shed light on the possibility to target such proteins for obtaining new anti-infectives, overcoming the extensive drug resistance problems of clinically used drugs."
