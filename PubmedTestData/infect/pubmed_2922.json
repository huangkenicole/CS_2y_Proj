        "The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes of patients with nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP); a new category of pneumonia proposed by the Japanese Respiratory Society.",
        "We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients with NHCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) hospitalized at a single center between January 2008 and December 2010, and compared their clinical characteristics. The criteria for NHCAP were as follows: (1) residence in a nursing home or an extended-care ward, (2) a discharge from a hospital in the preceding 90 days, (3) an elderly or handicapped patient who needs long-term care, (4) a patient who regularly requires vascular access in an outpatient setting.",
        "A total of 442 NHCAP patients and 451 CAP patients were evaluated. The NHCAP patients were older and had a higher frequency of underlying diseases. Aspiration was thought to be associated with the NHCAP in 63% of patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in both groups, whereas the frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens was higher in the NHCAP patients. The most frequently used antimicrobials in NHCAP patients were penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors. The in-hospital mortality and recurrence rates were significantly higher in NHCAP patients than in CAP patients (13.1% vs. 5.1%, p<0.001 and 18.8% vs. 5.5%, p<0.001).",
        "The clinical picture of NHCAP is consistent with that of HCAP described in the past. It is thought to be of benefit to modify the healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) criteria considering the healthcare and social health insurance system in Japan."
