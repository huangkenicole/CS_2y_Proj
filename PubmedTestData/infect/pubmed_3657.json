        "Diseases of striped bass, their hybrids, and redfish (red drum) are important constraints to the culture of these two species. Since striped bass have been cultured for years the organisms that cause most diseases of these fish are well known, but very little specific disease information exists for redfish. However, it appears that the organisms that cause diseases of striped bass and redfish do not differ greatly from those of other fishes. The most significant viral disease is lymphocystis, but infectious pancreatic necrosis has occurred in striped bass. Vibriosis (Vibrio sp.) and motile Aeromonas septicemia (Aeromonas hydrophila) are the most frequently encountered bacterial diseases. Both species of fish are affected by fungi (usually Saprolegnia) when the fish are injured or stressed. Amyloodinium ocellatum is the most serious protozoan that infects striped bass and redfish, but the other common protozoans (Trichodina, Ichthyophthirius, Cryptocaron, etc.) have also been reported. Treatment of any of these diseases is a problem because of the absence of approved drugs or chemicals for use on striped bass or redfish. The most common therapeutics used on striped bass and redfish are copper sulfate, formalin, salt (in freshwater) and Terramycin."
