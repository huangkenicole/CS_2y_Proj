        "The abilities of Massachusetts-type vaccine virus and virulent infectious bronchitis (IB) field virus to increase colibacillosis susceptibility were compared. In four experiments, 29-day-old female commercial broilers housed in isolators, were infected intratracheally and oculonasally with IB vaccine strains (H120 and H52) or virulent IB field strains (D387 and M41) (4.8 or 6.8 log(10) median embryo infective dose, per broiler). Five days later, Escherichia coli 506 strain was given intratracheally (5.6 to 8.8 log(10) colony forming units/broiler). The incidence of nasal discharge at 3 and 5 days after IB virus infection was used to assess the clinical effect of the IB infection, while mortality, body weight uniformity and E. coli lesions at 7 days following E. coli inoculation were used as parameters for colibacillosis. Nasal discharge was observed in 6/117 (5%), 26/119 (22%), 35/119 (29%) and 115/120 (96%) of broilers infected with H120, H52, D387 and M41 virus, respectively. Apart from H52 and D387, differences between IBV strains were significant. IB vaccine and virulent IB viruses did not generally differ significantly in their ability to induce colibacillosis susceptibility. Mean colibacillosis lesion scores of H52-infected birds even significantly exceeded those of birds infected with the other IB viruses. The ability of H120 virus to induce colibacillosis susceptibility tended to be the weakest. The practical consequences of these findings are discussed."
