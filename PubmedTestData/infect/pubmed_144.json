        "Viral capsid components that bind cellular receptors mediate critical functions in viral tropism and disease pathogenesis. Mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) spread systemically in newborn mice to cause serotype-specific disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Serotype 1 (T1) reovirus infects ependymal cells to cause nonlethal hydrocephalus, whereas serotype 3 (T3) reovirus infects neurons to cause fulminant and lethal encephalitis. This serotype-dependent difference in tropism and concomitant disease is attributed to the \u03c31 viral attachment protein, which is composed of head, body, and tail domains. To identify \u03c31 sequences that contribute to tropism for specific cell types in the CNS, we engineered a panel of viruses expressing chimeric \u03c31 proteins in which discrete \u03c31 domains have been reciprocally exchanged. Parental and chimeric \u03c31 viruses were compared for replication, tropism, and disease induction following intracranial inoculation of newborn mice. Viruses expressing T1 \u03c31 head sequences infect the ependyma, produce relatively lower titers in the brain, and do not cause significant disease. In contrast, viruses expressing T3 \u03c31 head sequences efficiently infect neurons, replicate to relatively higher titers in the brain, and cause a lethal encephalitis. Additionally, T3 \u03c31 head-expressing viruses display enhanced infectivity of cultured primary cortical neurons compared with T1 \u03c31 head-expressing viruses. These results indicate that T3 \u03c31 head domain sequences promote infection of neurons, likely by interaction with a neuron-specific receptor, and dictate tropism in the CNS and induction of encephalitis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viral encephalitis is a serious and often life-threatening inflammation of the brain. Mammalian orthoreoviruses are promising oncolytic therapeutics for humans but establish virulent, serotype-dependent disease in the central nervous system (CNS) of many young mammals. Serotype 1 reoviruses infect ependymal cells and produce hydrocephalus, whereas serotype 3 reoviruses infect neurons and cause encephalitis. Reovirus neurotropism is hypothesized to be dictated by the filamentous \u03c31 viral attachment protein. However, it is not apparent how this protein mediates disease. We discovered that sequences forming the most virion-distal domain of T1 and T3 \u03c31 coordinate infection of either ependyma or neurons, respectively, leading to mutually exclusive patterns of tropism and disease in the CNS. These studies contribute new knowledge about how reoviruses target cells for infection in the brain and inform the rational design of improved oncolytic therapies to mitigate difficult-to-treat tumors of the CNS."
