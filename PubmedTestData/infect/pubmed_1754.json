        "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly aggressive peripheral T-cell malignancy that develops after long-term chronic infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). Despite the recent advances in chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and supportive care, the prognosis for patients with ATL is one of the poorest among hematological malignancies; overall survival (OS) at 3 years is only 24 % in the more aggressive subtypes of ATLL. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus infecting approximately 10-20 million people worldwide, particularly in southern and southeastern Japan, the Caribbean, highlands of South America, Melanesia, and Equatorial Africa. Despite this high frequency of human infection, only 2-5 % of HTLV-1-infected individuals develop ATLL. Three major routes of viral transmission have been established: (1) mother-to-child transmission through breast-feeding; (2) sexual transmission, predominantly from men to women; and (3) cellular blood components. Multiple factors (e.g., virus, host cell, and immune factors) have been implicated in the development of ATLL, although the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully elucidated. No preventive vaccine against HTLV-1 is currently available, and interrupting the well-recognized primary modes of HTLV-1 transmission is the mainstay of ATLL prevention. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission through the replacement of breast-feeding has been shown to have the most significant impact on the incidence of HTLV-1 infection, and public health policies should consider the risk of malnutrition, especially in developing countries where malnutrition is the significant cause of infant mortality."
