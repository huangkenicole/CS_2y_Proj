        "A steer was infected with Theileria mutans (Aitong) by application of infected Amblyomma variegatum nymphs. Uninfected A. variegatum larvae were applied to this steer when piroplasms developed. The resultant (and infected) A. variegatum nymphs were applied to the ears of rabbits. Equal numbers of ticks were removed daily from rabbits and ground in Eagles Minimal Essential Medium. The infectivity of the supernatant fluid was tested in cattle. The produced supernatant fluids were infective between days 3 to 7 but noninfective on days 0, 1 and 2. The feeding of A. variegatum on cattle and rabbits was compared and the increase of haemoglobin in the supernatant was correlated with the weight increase of the nymphs. It is hoped that infective T. mutans (Aitong) stabilate derived from ticks can be produced using this information."
