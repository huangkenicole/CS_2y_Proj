        "Within-host interactions between co-infecting parasites can significantly influence the evolution of key parasite traits, such as virulence (pathogenicity of infection). The type of interaction is expected to predict the direction of selection, with antagonistic interactions favouring more virulent genotypes and synergistic interactions less virulent genotypes. Recently, it has been suggested that virulence can further be affected by the genetic identity of co-infecting partners (G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0G interactions), complicating predictions on disease dynamics. Here, we used a natural host-parasite system including a fish host and a trematode parasite to study the effects of G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0G interactions on infection virulence. We exposed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) either to single genotypes or to mixtures of two genotypes of the eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and estimated parasite infectivity (linearly related to pathogenicity of infection, measured as coverage of eye cataracts) and relative cataract coverage (controlled for infectivity). We found that both traits were associated with complex G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0G interactions, including both increases and decreases from single infection to co-infection, depending on the genotype combination. In particular, combinations where both genotypes had low average infectivity and relative cataract coverage in single infections benefited from co-infection, while the pattern was opposite for genotypes with higher performance. Together, our results show that infection outcomes vary considerably between single and co-infections and with the genetic identity of the co-infecting parasites. This can result in variation in parasite fitness and consequently impact evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions."
