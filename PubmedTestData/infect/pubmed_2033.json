        "<i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i> is a type of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria that causes various respiratory tract infections including asthma. <i>Chlamydia</i> species infect humans and cause respiratory infection by rupturing the lining of the respiratory which includes the throat, lungs and windpipe. Meanwhile, the function of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in <i>Ch. pneumoniae</i> respiratory infection and its association with the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in adulthood and causing allergic airway disease (AAD) are not understood properly. We therefore investigated the role of IL-4 in respiratory infection and allergy caused by early life <i>Chlamydia</i> infection. In this study, Ch. pneumonia strain was propagated and cultured in HEp-2 cells according to standard protocol and infant C57BL/6 mice around 3-4 weeks old were infected to study the role of IL-4 in respiratory infection and allergy caused by early life <i>Chlamydia</i> infection. We observed that IL-4 is linked with <i>Chlamydia</i> respiratory infection and its absence lowers respiratory infection. IL-4R \u03b12 is also responsible for controlling the IL-4 signaling pathway and averts the progression of infection and inflammation. Furthermore, the IL-4 signaling pathway also influences infection-induced AHR and aids in increasing AAD severity. STAT6 also promotes respiratory infection caused by <i>Ch. pneumoniae</i> and further enhanced its downstream process. Our study concluded that IL-4 is a potential target for preventing infection-induced AHR and severe asthma."
