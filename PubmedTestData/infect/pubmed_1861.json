        "Virulent strains of Nocardia asteroides and Nocardia caviae were injected into mice by five different routes. When these organisms were grown to the same stage of growth in the same medium and otherwise prepared identically, it was found that they differed significantly in their ability to infect and kill the host, depending entirely upon the route of inoculation. Thus, N. caviae 112 was 30 times more virulent than N. asteroides GUH-2 when administered intranasally, whereas N. asteroides was at least 10 times more pathogenic than N. caviae when injected intravenously. They had similar degrees of virulence when given intraperitoneally. N. asteroides GUH-2 induced a more persistent and progressive infection than N. caviae 112 when injected into the footpads of mice; however, the latter strain was more lethal for the animals when given by this route. Different routes of infecting mice indicate a compartmentalization of the host response to different strains of nocardia. Therefore, the use of different strains of nocardia under carefully controlled and defined conditions should make it possible to dissect the nocardia-host interactions at the cellular levels."
