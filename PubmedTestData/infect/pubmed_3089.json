        "Helminth parasites infect approximately 1/3 of the human population. They induce a characteristic immune response whose main focus seems to be to contain the worm parasites and avoid excessive damage to the host. Macrophages are a central player in this response and research using helminth infection models has highlighted the heterogeneity of macrophage responses including distinct recruitment mechanisms, subset-specific activation profiles, and functional diversity. Thus, helminth infection models offer the excellent opportunity to analyze a unique part of the macrophage activation spectrum as well as dissect the functional contributions of macrophages to a wide variety of biologically relevant conditions like wound healing, fibrosis, and immunoregulation.As an example for the analysis of macrophages associated with helminth infection this chapter describes the isolation and magnetic enrichment of pleural macrophages from mice infected with the natural rodent parasite Litomosoides sigmodontis. In addition, it includes a detailed description of how to determine the ontogeny and proliferation status of macrophage populations in helminth infections. Although the focus of this chapter is on helminth infection-derived macrophages, the described methods can easily be adapted to other disease models."
