      "AbstractText": [
        "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus (PCVs) are two major viruses that affect pigs. Coinfections between PRRSV and PCV2 are frequently reported in most outbreaks, with clinical presentations involving dyspnea, fever, reduced feed intake, weight loss, and death in fattening pigs. The NADC30-like PRRSV and PCV2d are the main circulating virus strains found in China. This study determines the impact of NADC30-like PRRSV and PCV2d mono-infection and coinfection on the immune system, organ pathology, and viral shedding in five-week-old post-weaned pigs. Pigs were randomly divided into six groups: PBS, PRRSV, PCV2, PRRSV-PCV2 coinfection (co), and PRRSV-PCV2 or PCV2-PRRSV sequential infections. Fever, dyspnea, decreased feed intake, weight loss, and pig deaths occurred in groups infected with PRRSV, Co-PRRSV-PCV2, and PRRSV-PCV2. The viral load was higher in Co-PRRSV-PCV2, PRRSV-PCV2, and PCV2-PRRSV than those mono-infected with PRRSV or PCV2. Additionally, cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, and IL-10) produced by pigs under Co-PRRSV-PCV2 and PRRSV-PCV2 groups were more intense than the other groups. Necropsy findings showed hemorrhage, emphysema, and pulmonary adhesions in the lungs of pigs infected with PRRSV. Smaller alveoli and widened lung interstitium were found in the Co-PRRSV-PCV2 and PRRSV-PCV2 groups. In conclusion, PRRSV and PCV2 coinfection and sequential infection significantly increased viral pathogenicity and cytokine responses, resulting in severe clinical signs, lung pathology, and death."
