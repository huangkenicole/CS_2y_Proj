        "The dog is the final host for sarcosporidia cysts from the oesophagus and diaphragm of donkeys from Sardinia. The prepatent period lasted 9 to 10 days. Sporocysts measured 12.2-13.8 X 9.2-9.9 microns. Infection of a horse with 10(5) donkey/dog sporocysts increased the rectal temperature to more than 40 degrees C on days 10 and 20 after infection. On day 138 p.i. predominantly immature cysts containing metrocytes were found, especially in the oesophagus. Infection on day 117 p.i. with 2 X 10(5) horse/dog sporocysts did not give rise to a temperature increase during the following 21 days. The final host of sarcosporidia cysts from the oesophagus and diaphragm of horses from Sardinia is the dog. The prepatent period lasted 9-10 days. Sporocysts measured 12.2-13.8 X 9.2-9.9 microns. The rise in the rectal temperature of three foals infected with horse/dog sporocysts did not differ from that of the foal infected with donkey/dog sporocysts. In both cases rectal temperature increased to more than 40 degrees C on days 10 and 20 following infection with 10(5) sporocysts. Because of the occurrence of two temperature peaks following infection, two generations of schizogony are postulated. The presence of a sarcosporidia species occurring in the donkey only is doubtful."
