        "Protozoan hemoflagellates Leishmania are causative agents of leishmaniases and an important biological model for study of host-pathogen interaction. A wide range of methods of Leishmania cultivation on both biphasic and liquid media is available. Biphasic media are considered to be superior for initial isolation of the parasites and obtaining high promastigote infectivity; however, liquid media are more suitable for large-scale experiments. The aim of the present study was the adaptation and optimization of the cultivation of Leishmania promastigotes on a biphasic SNB-9 (saline-neopeptone-blood 9) medium that was originally developed for Trypanosoma cultivation and combines the advantages of biphasic and liquid media. SNB-9 medium is characterized with a large volume of the liquid phase, which facilitates the manipulation with the culture and provides parasite yields comparable to parasite yields on such liquid medium as Schneider's Insect Medium. We demonstrate that SNB-9 very considerably surpasses Schneider's Insect Medium in in vitro infectivity of the parasites. Additionally, we show that the ratio of apoptotic parasites, which are important for the infectivity of the inoculum, in Leishmania culture in SNB-9 is higher than in Leishmania culture in Schneider's Insect Medium. Thus, we demonstrate that the cultivation of Leishmania on SNB-9 reliably yields highly infective promastigotes suitable for experimental infection."
