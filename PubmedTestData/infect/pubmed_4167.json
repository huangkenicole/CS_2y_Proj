        "Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were inoculated with several different concentrations of chicken anemia agent (CAA) by the intra-abdominal, intratracheal, or oral routes. Based on lowered hematocrit values, the birds were most susceptible to CAA introduced by the intra-abdominal route. When SPF chickens were infected with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) at 1 day of age, they remained susceptible to CAA up to at least 21 days, whereas birds inoculated with CAA alone were susceptible only at 1 day of age. Infectious bursal disease virus introduced at 1 day of age also increased the susceptibility of birds to contact infection with CAA and resulted in increased mortality rates in CAA inoculates. The response of SPF birds to CAA infection varied following exposure at 1 day of age to two different strains of IBDV (STC and Variant-E). Chicken anemia agent contacts and inoculates infected with the Variant-E strain were affected 1 week earlier by CAA than by STC inoculates, as evidenced by depressed hematocrits. However, the total number of birds affected was similar for both the Variant-E and STC-inoculated chickens. Commercial broiler chickens inoculated at 1, 7, 10, and 14 days of age by non-parenteral routes with CAA or a combination of CAA and IBDV had mean hematocrits that were lower than controls. Several CAA-inoculated birds were considered anemic, with hematocrit values of 25 or less, while uninoculated birds remained within normal ranges."
