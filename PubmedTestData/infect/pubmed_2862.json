        "The endoparasitic dinoflagellate Amoebophrya infects a number of free-living marine dinoflagellates, including harmful algal bloom species. The parasitoid eventually kills its host and has been proposed to be a significant loss factor for dinoflagellate blooms in restricted coastal waters. For several decades, the difficulties of culturing host-parasitoid systems have been a great obstacle for further research on the biology of Amoebophrya. Here, we established an Akashiwo sanguinea-Amoebophrya sp. coculture from Chinese coastal waters and studied the parasitoid's generation time, dinospore survival and infectivity, as well as its host specificity. The lifespan of Amoebophrya sp. ex. A.\u00a0sanguinea was approximately 58\u00a0h. The infective dinospores can survive up to 78\u00a0h in ambient waters but gradually lose their infectivity. The parasitoid was unable to infect other dinoflagellate species, its infection rate reached as high as 91% when the ratio of dinospores to host cells was 20:1. The high infectivity of dinospores suggests that the Amoebophrya strain was capable of removing a considerable fraction of host biomass within a short period, but that it is probably unable to maintain high infection levels under nonbloom conditions of its host, due to limited survival and time constraints in encountering host cells."
