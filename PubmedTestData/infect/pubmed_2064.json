        "Infections caused by verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157) have emerged as a major public health concern. The nature and severity of associated clinical sequelae are such that symptomatic cases often require hospitalization, with possible exposure to other patients and healthcare workers, including laboratory personnel, to the risk of acquiring VTEC O157. The occurrence of such episodes of hospital- and laboratory-acquired infections has demonstrated that these concerns are justified. Hospital infection control teams must ensure that staff are aware of this potential hazard, and laboratories must review their operating procedures to ensure that their personnel are not unnecessarily exposed, particularly in the light of revised guidance on the safe handling of these organisms."
