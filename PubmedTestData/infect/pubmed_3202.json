        "The most important clinical and pathological manifestation of Hendra virus infection in horses and humans is that of severe interstitial pneumonia caused by viral infection of small blood vessels. The virus is also capable of causing nervous disease. Hendra virus is not contagious in horses and is spread by close contact with body fluids, such as froth from infected lungs. Diagnosis should be based on the laboratory examination of blood, lung, kidney, spleen, and, if nervous signs are present, also of the brain. Evidence of infection with the more recently identified and related Nipah virus was found in the brain of one horse in which there was inflammation of the meningeal blood vessels. Fruit bats, especially Pteropus s., have been incriminated as the natural and reservoir hosts of both Hendra and Nipah viruses."
