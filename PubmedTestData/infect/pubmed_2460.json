        "Extra-urogenital infections due to <i>Mycoplasma hominis</i> (<i>M. hominis</i>) are rare, particularly co-infection with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>). Herein, we report on a patient who was co-infected and successfully treated despite delayed treatment.",
        "We reported the case of a 43-year-old man with <i>M. hominis</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> co-infection after a traffic accident. The patient developed a fever and severe infection despite postoperative antimicrobial therapies. The blood culture of wound tissues was positive for <i>P. aeruginosa.</i> Meanwhile, culturing of blood and wound samples showed pinpoint-sized colonies on blood agar plates and fried-egg-type colonies on mycoplasma medium, which were identified as <i>M. hominis</i> by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA sequencing. Based on antibiotic susceptibility and symptoms, ceftazidime-avibactam and moxifloxacin were administered for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection. Meanwhile, after the failure of a series of anti-infective agents, <i>M. hominis</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> co-infection was successfully treated with a minocycline-based regimen and polymyxin B.",
