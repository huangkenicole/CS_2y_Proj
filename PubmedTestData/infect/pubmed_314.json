        "Mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) is a member of the genus Betaretrovirus, infects rodent cells and uses mouse tranferrin receptor 1 for cell entry. Several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells. Here, we analysed whether MMTV from C3H mice [MMTV(C3H)], reported previously to be incapable of infecting human cells, could productively infect human cells. Using a recently described high-titre MMTV-based vector carrying MMTV(C3H) envelope protein (Env), we successfully transduced cells of human origin. Furthermore, WT MMTV(C3H) was able to infect human cells, albeit less efficiently than mouse cells. The established infection was, however, sufficient to enable virus spread to every cell in culture. The infectivity of WT MMTV(C3H) and MMTV-based vectors carrying MMTV(C3H)Env was blocked by heat inactivation, an inhibitor of reverse transcription (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine) and pre-incubation with neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies that did not neutralize vectors pseudotyped with amphotropic murine leukemia virus Env, providing evidence for an authentic, receptor-mediated and reverse transcriptase-dependent infection process. Persistently infected human Hs578T cells produced infectious virions capable of infecting na\u00efve human breast cells in culture, the infectivity of which could also be blocked by neutralizing anti-MMTV antibodies, demonstrating that virus particles released by the persistently infected Hs578T cells were related antigenically to the virus produced from murine cells. Taken together, our results show that MMTV(C3H), like MMTV(GR) and MMTV(RIII), is able not only to infect but also to replicate in cultured human breast cells."
