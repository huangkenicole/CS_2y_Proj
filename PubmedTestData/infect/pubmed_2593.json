        "Research on the role of type 1 fimbriae of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis in poultry to date has been focused on the intestinal phase of the infection. This study aimed to investigate the role of type 1 fimbriae in a systemic infection by intravenously inoculating chickens with a fimD mutant or its parent strain. The fimD mutant was present in the blood for 3 weeks after infection, while the wild type parent strain was cleared within the first 3 days. The fimD mutant was isolated at least as much as the parent strain from the liver and spleen for up to 3 weeks after inoculation. The wild type strain was cleared from the caeca in the second week, while the fimD mutant was isolated from the caeca for up to 3 weeks after infection. The ovaries were more heavily infected by the fimD mutant than by the wild-type strain. In the first and second week after inoculation, the oviducts were more frequently infected by the mutant strain. The eggs of birds infected with the fimD mutant were less frequently contaminated with Salmonella. The shells of the eggs were more frequently contaminated by the wild type strain than with the mutant strain. Thus, the absence of type 1 fimbriae prolongs bacteraemia, modifies reproductive tract infection and reduces egg shell contamination by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis."
