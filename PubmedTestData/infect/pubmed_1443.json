        "A commercial alcoholic disinfectant (Welpas) was tested for its activity against adenovirus type 3 (Ad 3) by using two procedures, the in vitro suspension test and the in vivo fingertip test. Other available techniques for the sterilization of fingers were also evaluated for removal of Ad by using the fingertip test. In the suspension tests, the infectivity of Ad 3 was reduced to undetectable levels within 30-60 seconds. This results suggest the effectiveness of this disinfectant in reducing Ad infectivity. In the fingertip tests, the viruses were recovered from fingertips in varying titers after using one of the following techniques: wiping with tissue papers, washing with running water, washing with soap and rinsing with water, rubbing with Welpas, wiping with cotton soaked in 70% alcohol, or washing with a brush under running water. However, the viruses were not recovered when the fingertip was washed with water, wiped with paper, and rubbed with Welpas successively. This technique was found to be the most effective method currently available."
