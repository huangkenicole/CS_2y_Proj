        "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has gained increased global recognition in recent years, particularly in developed countries. We summarized here a selection of the literature published since the 1st of June, 2017.",
        "Longitudinal studies are increasingly conducted in Europe, to determine trends in HEV prevalence. The spectrum of mammals infected with HEV and potentially capable to transmit it to humans has widened. New virological data on HEV repCon and pathogenicity have been reported and clinical features of HEV infections have been precised or newly described. Finally, there are some new data on the therapeutic management of HEV infections in various clinical settings.",
        "HEV emergence in developed countries appears to be based on improved diagnosis tools and increased awareness of clinicians that HEV transmission is essentially autochthonous and is a possible cause of life-threatening acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and extra-hepatic symptoms. In addition, the distribution of HEV strains evolves. Ribavirin remains to date the only specific treatment recommended for HEV infection, being efficient in the majority but not in all cases."
