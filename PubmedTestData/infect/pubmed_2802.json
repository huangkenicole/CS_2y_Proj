        "To compare the prophylactic effects of intravenous moxifloxacin and vancomycin for Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis in a rabbit model.",
        "Albino rabbits (n = 60) were divided into three groups. Intravenous moxifloxacin was injected into 20 animals (group 1), and intravenous vancomycin was injected into 20 animals (group 2). In group 3, 20 animals received 0.9% normal saline. After these prophylactic intravenous injections, the right eyes of the 60 rabbits were injected intravitreally with 10(5) colony-forming units of S. epidermidis. Intravenous antibiotic injection was repeated on days 1, 2, and 3 after infection. Clinical features were evaluated on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after infection, and 10 eyes per group were then enucleated for histopathologic examination. Vitreous aspirates were obtained for bacterial culture on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after infection from the other 10 eyes per group.",
        "The moxifloxacin group showed significant clinical effects at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (P = 0.019, < 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively); bacteriologic results at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (P = 0.001, 0.002, 0.01, and 0.002, respectively); and histopathologic results, with less severe inflammation and relatively well-preserved retinal architecture. However, no difference was detected between the vancomycin group and control group in any aspect examined.",
        "Intravenously administered moxifloxacin showed a significant prophylactic effect against S. epidermidis endophthalmitis. Thus, intravenous moxifloxacin may be a useful prophylactic medication against postoperative endophthalmitis."
