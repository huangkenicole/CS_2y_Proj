        "Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) affects over 80 fish species, leading to viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Horizontal VHSV transmission is widely studied, with researchers utilizing various doses to establish infection models. Infected hosts shed the virus into the environment, elevating the risk of transmission to na\u00efve fish within the same system. This study aimed to ascertain the minimum infective dose of VHSV in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). In olive flounder, the detection of VHSV within the kidney exhibited the highest infection rate on the third day among days 1, 3 and 5. Doses of 10<sup>3.0</sup> to 10<sup>4.7</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml were administered to juvenile olive flounder across three farms. Results showed resistance to infection below 10<sup>3.4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml at 15\u00a0\u00b0C. While infection frequency varied by concentration, higher concentrations correlated with more infections. Nonetheless, viral copy numbers did not differ significantly among infected fish at varying concentrations. This study underscores the need for early VHSV management and contributes essential data for pathogenicity assessment and foundational knowledge."
