      "AbstractText": [
        "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus characterized by diarrhea and high morbidity rates, and the mortality rate is 100% in piglets less than 2 weeks old. Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF-\u03b2 is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin \u03b15 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin \u03b15 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin \u03b15 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin \u03b15 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection. Our results provide new insights into secondary infection and suggest that targeted anti-EMT therapy may have implications for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection."
