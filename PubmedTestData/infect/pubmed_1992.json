        "In the fall of 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) was isolated during an outbreak of neurologic disease in humans, horses, and wild and zoological birds in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Turkeys could potentially be a large reservoir for WNV because of the high-density turkey farming and the presence of large wild turkey populations in the eastern seaboard of the United States. Little is known about the pathogenicity of WNV in domestic or wild turkeys. Specific-pathogen-free 3-wk-old turkeys were inoculated subcutaneously with 10(3.3) mean tissue culture infective doses of a WNV strain isolated fromthe index case in a New York crow. No clinical signs were observed in the turkeys over the 21 days of the experiment. One turkey died abruptly at 8 days postinoculation (DPI). Many turkeys developed viremia between 2 and 10 DPI, but the average level of virus was very low, less than needed to efficiently infect mosquitos. Low levels of WNV were detected in feces on 4 and 7 DPI, but no virus was isolated from oropharyngeal swabs. WNV wasnot transmitted from WNV-inoculated to contact-exposed turkeys. All WNV-inoculated poults seroconverted on 7 DPI. In the turkey that died, WNV was not isolated from intestine, myocardium, brain, kidney, or cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs, but sparse viral antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the heart and spleen. Turkeys in contact with WNV-inoculated turkeys and sham-inoculated controls lacked WNV specific antibodies,and WNV was not isolated from plasma and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. These data suggest that WNV lacks the potential to be a major new disease of turkeys and that turkeys will not be a significant amplifying host for infecting mosquitos."
