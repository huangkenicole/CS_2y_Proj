        "The interactions between Trypanosoma congolense and Haemonchus contortus infections were studied in N'Dama calves. A total of 38 N'Dama bulls was divided into four groups and each group infected either with H. contortus 1 week after infection with T. congolense or with T. congolense 4 weeks after infection with H. contortus, or with either infection singly. Parasitological (faecal egg counts, parasitaemia), haematological (packed cell volume, white blood cell counts, albumin) and clinical parameters (body weight change, mortality rate) were compared among the various groups. The results showed a reduced prepatent period and a markedly increased pathogenicity of H. contortus infections in animals with a concurrent T. congolense infection. The most harmful combination was a H. contortus infection 1 week after the T. congolense infection which resulted in a progressive and severe anaemia, accompanied by hypoalbuminaemia, increased weight loss and high mortality. The anaemia induced by dual infections showed a low responsiveness to chemotherapy and in several cases supportive treatment did not help recovery. The results also showed that animals with a concurrent T. congolense and H. contortus infection ran a higher risk of succumbing during the infection, and also during 10 weeks following treatment. Although infections with T. congolense alone produced no clinical signs, they were found to significantly reduce the ability of infected animals to mount a normal response to a subsequent H. contortus infection. It was concluded that the increased H. contortus egg excretion observed in animals infected with both parasites might significantly increase the risk of nematode infections and that the reduced prepatent period might necessitate more frequent anthelmintic treatments. These interactions should, therefore, be considered wherever attempts are made to control these two diseases."
