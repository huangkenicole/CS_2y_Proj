        "State-level stay-at-home orders were monitored to determine their effect on the rate of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Confirmed cases were tracked before and after state-level stay-at-home orders were put in place. Linear regression techniques were used to determine slopes for log case count data, and meta analyses were conducted to combine data across states. The results were remarkably consistent across states and support the usefulness of stay-at-home orders in reducing COVID-19 infection rates."
