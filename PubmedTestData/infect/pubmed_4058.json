        "A short introduction to each of the known hepatitis viruses is provided, along with brief information about the transmission, associated disease progression, and treatment of each virus. All of the different hepatitis viruses in existence have the common factor of infecting the liver cells. These viruses can infect other cells as well. Evidence exists of several new hepatitis viruses that have yet to be properly identified. The existence of these new viruses provides still more reason for blood and blood products to be virally inactivated for as broad a spectrum of viruses as possible. The hemophilia community was not aware of the serious risks that existed from hepatitis-infected blood products, so little pressure was applied to the blood banks and blood fractionators to screen out blood drawn from infected persons or those with signs of liver disease. Some known viruses are still not screened for, and methods to more completely eradicate viruses from blood and blood products are not yet implemented; treatment for hepatitis and liver disease remains inadequate."
