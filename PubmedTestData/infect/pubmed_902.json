        "Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 (IDH), and various other clinical conditions. Several of these diseases can occur in association.",
        "Report an association of diseases related to HTLV-1 infection, occurring in an unusual age group.",
        "Dermatological and laboratory exams were consecutively performed in HTLV-1-infected individuals from January 2008 to July 2010 in the HTLV Outpatient Clinic at the Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Emilio Ribas\" in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",
        "A total of 193 individuals (73 HAM/TSP and 120 asymptomatic carriers) were evaluated, three of which were associated with adult-onset IDH and HAM/TSP. In all three cases, the patients were affected by IDH after the development and progression of HAM/TSP-associated symptoms.",
        "Small number of cases because of the rarity of these diseases.",
        "We draw attention to the possibility of co-presentation of adult-onset IDH in patients with a previous diagnosis of HAM/TSP, although IDH is a disease classically described in children. Thus, dermatologists should be aware of these diagnoses in areas endemic for HTLV-1 infection."
