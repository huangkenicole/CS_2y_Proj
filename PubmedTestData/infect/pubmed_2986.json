      "AbstractText": [
        "Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is an important sexually transmitted pathogen that infects the genital mucosal epithelial cells causing ulcerative lesions at the site of entry, facilitating HIV infection. The infection of epithelial cells and skin resident dendritic cells with HSV-2 causes a release of chemokine and retinoic acid which attracts CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells to the genital mucosa. In this study, we investigated whether HSV-2 (ATCC VR734) could infect and replicate in two T-cell lines (CEM CCR5+ and MOLT4 CCR5+). The growth of HSV-2 was assessed by plaque assay while the intracellular HSV-2 was identified using infectious center and indirect immunofluorescence assays. The replication of HSV-2 in T-cell lines was compared to a cell line (Vero) which is routinely used for growing HSV-2. Analysis indicated that a low level of infection was detected in the two T-cells lines and was dependent on the infectious dose as well as the time of adsorption. Indirect immunofluorescence showed presence of HSV-2 antigens in the CEM CCR5+ and Vero cell lines but not in MOLT4 CCR5+. The data suggests that T-cells can support growth of HSV-2 which might contribute to changes in gene expression of T-cells. This is an important aspect that needs to be further investigated in relation of HIV-1/HSV-2 viral synergy."
