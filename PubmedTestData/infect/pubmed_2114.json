        "The pathogenesis of rat virus (RV) infection was studied in random-bred Sprague-Dawley rats after oronasal inoculation of a recent RV isolate designated RV-Yale (RV-Y). RV-Y was pathogenic for rats inoculated as infants (2 days) whereas rats inoculated as juveniles (4 weeks) had asymptomatic infection and no lesions. Rats inoculated as infants developed pantropic infection accompanied by hepatic necrosis, granuloprival cerebellar hypoplasia and hemorrhagic encephalopathy. Virological and serological studies showed that virus could persist in inoculated rats for at least 35 days and for at least 28 days after seroconversion was first detected. Immunohistochemical results indicated that RV-Y infects tissues conducive to virus excretion including kidney and lung. RV-Y also was found in genital tissues of some rats. Athymic juvenile rats inoculated intraperitoneally with RV-Y had a poor humoral immune response and harbored infectious virus for at least 3 weeks, whereas infection in euthymic control rats was detected for 1 week. These studies indicate that RV-Y can persists in the presence of humoral immunity and suggest that transmission of infection could occur for a substantial period after seroconversion. They also suggest that immunodeficient rats have increased susceptibility to persistent infection."
