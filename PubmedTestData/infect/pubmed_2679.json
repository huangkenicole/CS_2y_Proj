      "AbstractText": [
        "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal disease and a growing public health problem in East Africa, where Ethiopia has one of the highest VL burdens. The largest focus of VL in Ethiopia is driven by high prevalence in migrant agricultural workers and associated with a high rate of coinfection with HIV. This coinfection makes VL more difficult to treat successfully and is associated with a high rate of relapse, with VL/HIV patients frequently experiencing many relapses of VL before succumbing to this infection. We present genome-wide data on Leishmania donovani isolates from a longitudinal study of cohorts of VL and VL/HIV patients reporting to a single clinic in Ethiopia. Extensive clinical data allow us to investigate the influence of coinfection and relapse on the populations of parasites infecting these patients. We find that the same parasite population is responsible for both VL and VL/HIV infections and that, in most cases, disease relapse is caused by recrudescence of the population of parasites that caused primary VL. Complex, multiclonal infections are present in both primary and relapse cases, but the infrapopulation of parasites within a patient loses genetic diversity between primary disease presentation and subsequent relapses, presumably due to a population bottleneck induced by treatment. These data suggest that VL/HIV relapses are not caused by genetically distinct parasite infections or by reinfection. Treatment of VL does not lead to sterile cure, and in VL/HIV, the infecting parasites are able to reestablish after clinically successful treatment, leading to repeated relapse of VL. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the second largest cause of deaths due to parasite infections and a growing problem in East Africa. In Ethiopia, it is particularly associated with migrant workers moving from regions of nonendemicity for seasonal agricultural work and is frequently found as a coinfection with HIV, which leads to frequent VL relapse following treatment. Insight into the process of relapse in these patients is thus key to controlling the VL epidemic in Ethiopia. We show that there is little genetic differentiation between the parasites infecting HIV-positive and HIV-negative VL patients. Moreover, we provide evidence that relapses are caused by the initially infecting parasite population and that treatment induces a loss of genetic diversity in this population. We propose that restoring functioning immunity and improving antiparasitic treatment may be key in breaking the cycle of relapsing VL in VL/HIV patients."
