        "Four dromedaries were infected with a virulent camelpox virus strain which was isolated from the lung of a Saudi Arabian camel. The camels which were infected intradermally and subcutaneously developed severe generalized camelpox. One of these camels had to be euthanized on humane grounds and the second one died 13 days after being infected. This dromedary also developed internal pox. Neither dromedary showed camelpox antibodies before infection. The other two camels which had been vaccinated with Ducapox 6 years prior to the viral challenge did not develop any clinical symptoms when given 5 ml of the field virus intravenously and intramuscularly. They seroconverted after the challenge. Although only two camels were used for this trial, the results indicate that a single dose of Ducapox can protect 1-year-old camels from camelpox infection for several years."
