        "The purpose of the present study was to assess the relationship between the awareness of HAART, beliefs regarding transmission of HIV of persons taking HAART, norms associated with sexual risk behaviour, fear of HIV/AIDS, optimism of finding a cure or vaccine, and sexual behaviour in the general population of Sweden. A mail survey was sent to 4,000 randomly selected individuals aged 16-44 years. The study shows that the general public of Sweden is aware of HAART. Only 15% of the population had never heard of HAART. Eight percent believed that those taking HAART were 'no longer' or 'less' infective. Those not aware of HAART reported greater fear of HIV infected persons, less volunteer testing for HIV, and more sexual partners. Those who believed that persons taking HAART were less infective reported greater fear, more optimism concerning the possibilities to find a cure or vaccine, and had more discussions regarding HIV. We conclude that a group that may be at increased risk of HIV infection may be persons who are not aware of HAART or believe that persons are no longer infective when taking HAART. These persons may be an additional target group for HIV prevention."
