        "Study of prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in one organized children community of St. Petersburg in the current period.",
        "390 children and adolescents of one of the general education schools of St. Petersburg were examined. Presence in blood sera of IgG to bacterial antigen of H. pylori and IgG to its CagA toxin by ELISA method was studied. In 222 children feces samples were studied. Determination of presence of H. pylori antigen in the feces was carried out by using Helicobacter pylori antigen ELISA Kit, Immundiagnostik test system.",
        "Comparison of H. pylori infection prevalence in children of various age revealed that infection is minimal in children aged 7 - 8 years (36.84%) and reaches maximum levels in students aged 14 years (66.67%). Screening result shows that there are 2 waves of H. pylori infection (the first peak was detected in 11 years, the second - in 14 years). Excess weight in H. pylori positive students is present less frequently (19.89% versus 30.13%). The difference is more notable in boys (20.25% and 38.75% respectively).",
        "A sufficiently high level of infectivity by H. pylori in the students of this school was detected. It was established, that seropositivity increases with student age and reaches maximum levels in upperclassmen. 2 waves of H. pylori infection curve are noticed. It was detected that excess weight occurs more frequently in children not infected by helicobater (p<0.05). Combination of various diagnostic methods gives more precise information on the presence of H. pylori infection."
