        "The infectivity and pathology of equine herpesvirus 9 (EHV-9), a new neurotropic equine herpesvirus isolated from gazelles, was studied in hamsters experimentally infected via nasal, ocular, oral, intravenous (IV), or peritoneal routes. Clinically, all animals inoculated by the nasal route and ~25% inoculated by the oral and peritoneal routes showed neurological signs on days 3, 6, and 9 postinoculation (PI), respectively. Neurological signs were not observed in animals administered EHV-9 by the IV and ocular routes. With the exception of animals administered EHV-9 by the IV route, all infected animals had lymphocytic meningoencephalitis. Although there were a number of differences in the severity and distribution of the lesions depending on the route of inoculation, the basic features of lymphocytic meningoencephalitis caused by EHV-9 were common. Lesions consisted of neuronal necrosis, perivascular aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, gliosis, intranuclear inclusion bodies, and diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates in the meninges. Viral antigen was detected in degenerated neurons in infected animals inoculated by the nasal, ocular, oral, and peritoneal routes. The distribution of EHV-9 antigen was somewhat dependent on inoculation route. There were no microscopic abnormalities or viral antigen in animals treated by the IV route. This study provides new data about experimental EHV-9 infection in hamsters through routes other than the IV route. These results suggest that in the animals infected by the oral, ocular, and peritoneal routes, EHV-9 might travel to the brain through nerves, other than by the olfactory route, after initial propagation at the site of viral entry."
