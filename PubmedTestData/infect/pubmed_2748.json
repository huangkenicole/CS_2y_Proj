        "Sheep and goats were shown to be susceptible to experimental infection with bovid herpesvirus 2 (BHV2), administered by either the intradermal or intravenous route. Lesions developing in sheep following intradermal inoculation of virus were similar to those in cattle inoculated intradermally, whereas the lesions in goats resolved without ulceration or scabbing. Disseminated circumscribed skin lesions developed in sheep and goats given BHV2 by the intravenous route. These lesions resolved in four to eight days without significant effect on the skin. BHV2 was isolated from skin lesions of sheep, goats and cattle that were infected intravenously, from sheep and cattle infected intradermally and from the leucocytes of the three species following intravenous inoculation of virus. Latent infection of sheep and goats was demonstrated following corticosteroid treatment 60 days after infection."
