        "Two groups of three Holstein heifers were immunized respectively with Vibrio fetus venerealis and Vibrio fetus intestinalis incorporated in Freund's complete adjuvant. Both serum and vaginal mucus agglutination titers increased following immunization. Vaginal mucus samples were more frequently positive when the homologous cells were used as antigen in the agglutination test. Ten non-immunized heifers were inoculated with another strain of V. fetus venerealis and slaughtered at periods of 30 to 40 and 60 to 70 days post-inoculation (DPI). Agglutinating antibodies were present in the vaginal mucus of some infected individuals by five weeks post-inoculation. In the course of the experiment 11 vaginal mucus samples were obtained which agglutinated heated cells of the infecting strain; one aggglutinated whole cells. Precipitins toward homologous antigens could not be demonstrated in vaginal mucus but four of six samples tested precipitated a heat stable extract from an intestinal strain of the same O-serotype. Bacterial antigen was detected by immunofluorescence on the surface, as well as within and beneath the epithelium at all levels of the reproductive tract regardless of time of slaughter. Lesions in infected animals consisted of focal and diffuse lymphocytosis, plasmacytosis, and epithelial vacuolation. Diffuse neutrophilic infiltration of the oviducts was observed. Agglutinins appeared in the serum of each of nine heifers immunized with whole cells of same venereal strain. Group mean serum titers for whole and heated cells were 1/28,000 and 1/1,300 respectively. Vaginal mucus samples agglutinated whole cells in 48% of tests while 6.3% reacted with heated cells. Serum, but not vaginal mucus, of immunized animals precipitated soluble antigens of the immunizing strain. The immunizing strain of V. fetus did not infect the reproductive tract of any of six immunized heifers upon challenge."
