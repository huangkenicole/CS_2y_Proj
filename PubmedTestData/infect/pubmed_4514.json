      "AbstractText": [
        "When mice are intravenously inoculated with a virulent Brucella abortus strain at day 12 to 14 of pregnancy and killed three to five days later, colonization of placentae, fetuses and spleens can be estimated by the frequency and level (bacterial count) of infection and by linkage between individual placental and paired fetal infections. This linkage indicates the placental barrier effect, defined as the number of non-infected fetuses linked to 100 colonized placentae. Immune mice serum raised against two Brucella fractions injected one day before challenge (1) restricted the placental colonization (the dose required to infect 50 per cent placentae was increased by 50 to 70 times compared to controls), (2) decreased the level of splenic and placental infection, and (3) increased the barrier effect so that most fetuses were protected even when linked to a heavily infected placenta. Immune (B + T) spleen cells from mice vaccinated with a Brucella cell-wall fraction transferred to recipients seven to eight days before mating, that is, 22 days before challenge (1) restricted the frequency of placental and fetal colonization, (2) decreased the level of splenic, placental and fetal infections, and (3) increased the barrier effect. However, separated B- and T-cells were less active, in particular on the level of fetal infection. In contrast with serum, the cells did not decrease infection of the fetuses linked to heavily infected placentae."
