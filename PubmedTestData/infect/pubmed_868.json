        "The influence of variations in the pH, NaCl concentration, temperature, and concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions on the survival of Chlamydia pneumoniae elementary bodies (EBs) outside the host cells was investigated. The survival was determined after various incubation periods by counting the inclusion-forming units after C. pneumoniae was cultured for 72 h on monolayers of HL cells. The normal physiological conditions were restored prior to infecting the HL cells with C. pneumoniae. Declines in the infectivities of C. pneumoniae EBs were observed at pH values of lower than 5 and higher than 8 or at NaCl concentrations of less than 80 mM. The viability of C. pneumoniae EBs in SPG medium decreased as the temperature and/or incubation period increased. Incubation temperatures of up to 20 degrees C and incubation periods of up to 48 h did not affect the viability of C. pneumoniae. One hundred percent of the C. pneumoniae EBs were infective after 1 h of incubation at 35 degrees C, whereas 90, 50, and 40% survived after incubations of 8, 24, and 48 h, respectively. The viability of C. pneumoniae was unaffected within the investigated range of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ion concentrations in the medium. The presence of 10% fetal calf serum in the incubation medium had a stabilizing effect on the viability of C. pneumoniae. This effect became more pronounced as the incubation period increased."
