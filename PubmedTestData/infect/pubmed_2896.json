        "Propionibacterium acnes is the gram positive anaerobic bacteria belongs to the normal skin and oral microbial flora. The participation of this microorganism in the infective endocarditis is still controversial. The aim of the study was to perform the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in 5 patients with infective endocarditis caused by Propionibacterium acnes. In 3 out of 5 patients the infective endocarditis developed after prosthesis valve replacement, in 2 others on the native valves. The inserted prostheses were mechanical ones, propionibacterium acnes was identified as causative organisms in all of the causes (two positive blood and/or valve culture). The bacterial strains were sensitive to the antibiotics as: penicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin, and vancomycin, however cephalosporins used at the beginning of the treatment in 3 patients and clindamycin in 1 patient had limited clinical efficacy. Later treatment with timentin, augmentin and tienamycin was successful in 3 patients; one patient was cured with vancomycin. One patient died because of septic, embolic complication in early stage of illness. We conclude the effectiveness of penicillins in combination with clavulanic acid and tienamycin in therapy of infective endocarditis due to Propionibacterium acnes. The treatment should be lasted during 4-6 weeks."
