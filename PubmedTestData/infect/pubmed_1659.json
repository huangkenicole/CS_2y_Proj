        "Using virions harvested from 293T cells stably expressing either low or high levels of surface ICAM-1, we determined that the number of virus-embedded host ICAM-1 proteins is positively influenced by the expression level of ICAM-1 on virus producer cells. Moreover, the increase in virion-bound host cell membrane ICAM-1 led to a concomitant enhancement of virus infectivity when a T-cell-tropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was used. The phenomenon was also seen when primary human cells were infected with virions pseudotyped with the envelope protein from a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolate, thus ruling out any envelope-specific effect. We also observed that target cells treated with NKI-L16, an anti-LFA-1 antibody known to increase the affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1, were markedly more susceptible to infection with HIV-1 particles bearing on their surfaces large numbers of host-derived ICAM-1 proteins. Given that cellular activation of leukocytes is known to modify the conformational state of LFA-1 and induce ICAM-1 surface expression, it is tempting to speculate that activation of virus-infected cells will lead to the production of HIV-1 particles bearing more host ICAM-1 on their surfaces and that such progeny virions will preferentially infect and replicate more efficiently in activated cells which are prevalent in lymphoid organs."
