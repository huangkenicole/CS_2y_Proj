        "To understand the transmission of respiratory syncytial virus, we examined the frequency of infection in volunteers after inoculation by different routes with varying doses of virus. Thirty-two adult volunteers received serial dilutions of a safety-tested live strain of respiratory syncytial virus instilled into nose, eye, or mouth. The highest inoculum, 5.2 log10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), was administered to four groups of four subjects each, by nose to one group, by eye to one group, and by mouth to two groups. Subsequently, 1:100 and 1:1,000 dilutions of this inoculum were administered by nose and eye. At the highest inoculum, infection occurred in three of four subjects inoculated by nose and in three of four subjects inoculated by eye. Infection occurred in one of eight subjects inoculated by mouth, but this subject most likely was infected by secondary spread. With an inoculum of 3.2 log10 TCID50, the proportion of subjects infected by either route diminished to 25%. When the inoculum was further reduced to 2.2 log10 TCID50, no infections occurred by either route. Infections after the highest inoculum were characterized by earlier and greater shedding. These findings suggest that respiratory syncytial virus may infect by eye or nose and that both of these routes appear equally sensitive. In comparison, the mouth appears to be an insensitive route of inoculation. This is of potential import in infection control procedures and in the development of vaccines or other prophylactic measures."
