      "AbstractText": [
        "To evaluate the interdependence between pathological changes and the level of infection the behaviour of Toxocara canis larvae in the host, the course of the disease as well as quality and quantity of histological changes were investigated after experimental infection with 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 larvae respectively. The main places where the larvae of Toxocara canis were found at any time after infection were musculature and brain. Regardless of the level of infection the absolute and relative number of larvae in the brain increased linearly, and parallel decreased in musculature. After the 60th day post infection the mice infected with 1,000 larvae showed compulsive movements, disturbance of equilibrium and paralysis of the hindlegs. The mice infected with 500 larvae showed similar symptoms 30 to 40 days later. Mice with weaker infections only showed slight disturbances of the general condition at the end of the trials. In the brain of all animals infected with larvae of Toxocara canis inflammatory reactions were found. Severe destructive changes in the nervous substance together with clinical symptoms were seen only in higher infected mice."
