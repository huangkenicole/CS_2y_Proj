      "AbstractText": [
        "Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by the encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, a dimorphic fungus recovered from pigeon excreta, soil, dust and human skin. After a primary infection in the lungs, the disease can disseminate via a haematogenous route to various organs, including the central nervous system and skin, in susceptible individuals. Cryptococcosis can present with a variety of skin and soft tissue manifestations including acneiform lesions, purpura, vesicles, nodules, abscesses, ulcers, granulomas, pustules, draining sinuses and cellulitis. We present a case of a young man with HIV infection who developed molluscum-like cutaneous lesions secondary to pulmonary cryptococcosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by Indian ink preparation of the cutaneous lesions. Primary cutaneous infection occurs rarely due to direct inoculation. Cutaneous lesions are usually secondary and act as a key marker of disseminated infection, especially in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as those infected with HIV, solid-organ transplant recipients, and those on chronic corticosteroid therapy."
