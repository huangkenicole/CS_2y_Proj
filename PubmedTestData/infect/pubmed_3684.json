        "A 76-year-old Japanese woman was admitted due to uncontrolled cellulitis of the right lower leg. She had deep vein thrombosis on the right limb. Moreover, she had a long history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with corticosteroids. Skin biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed to diagnose disseminated cryptococcosis. She was administered antifungal agents (liposomal amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine). On treatment day 14, debridement was performed, and cryptococcosis was controlled. However, she developed toxic megacolon due to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). On day 32, she was transferred to the intensive care unit due to severe acidosis and acute kidney injury secondary to CDI-related toxic megacolon. Vancomycin, metronidazole, and tigecycline were administered for treatment of CDI. After several weeks of intensive care, toxic megacolon was improved, but renal replacement therapy was discontinued according to the patient's will. On day 73, she died of renal failure. We experienced a complex of rare diseases, Cryptococcus neoformans cellulitis and Clostridioides difficile-related toxic megacolon. Both diseases were presumed to be the result of corticosteroid and methotrexate use. Hence, careful monitoring is required when treating immunocompromised hosts to reduce the risk of developing complications."
