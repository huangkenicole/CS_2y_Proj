        "The susceptibility of mule and muscovy ducks to \"blackhead\" disease caused by Histomonas meleagridis was studied, using an experimental intracloacal inoculation. Turkeys were used as controls. Morbidity, mortality and body weight gain were recorded regularly during the experiments. A direct examination of the caecal content was made to determine the absence or presence of the parasite. Gross and microscopic lesions were observed on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 post infection to evaluate any clinical histomoniosis in ducks and to appraise the histomonad's carriage. A scoring system was developed both for gross and histological lesions of the caecum and liver. Infected mule and muscovy ducks (n = 83) never developed any clinical signs of histomoniasis. Weight gains of infected mule and muscovy ducks were similar to those of uninfected ducks. In 67% of the ducks (56/83), it was possible to demonstrate the parasite in the caecal content throughout the experiment. Typical macroscopic caecal lesions were observed in five of the ducks between days 7 and 21 post infection, with a caecal necropsy main lesion score (MLS = 1.6) less severe than that in turkeys (MLS = 2.9). Only caecal histological lesions occurred in six of the cases. Therefore, ducks do not seem to be a susceptible host for \"blackhead\" but may act as carrier animals for H. meleagridis. The virulence was apparently not changed, since 67% of turkeys (10/15) infected with the caecal content of positive ducks displayed classical signs of blackhead disease. Even if H. meleagridis alone does not represent a substantial danger in the duck production, its infectivity should to be taken into account in the transmission to more susceptible species."
