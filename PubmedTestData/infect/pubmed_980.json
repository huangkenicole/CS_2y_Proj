        "Enterovirus 70 (EV70) is one of several human enteroviruses that exhibit a propensity for infecting the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanisms by which neurotropic enteroviruses gain access to and invade the CNS are poorly understood. One possibility is that circulating leukocytes become infected and carry neurotropic enteroviruses to the CNS. We examined the ability of EV70 to infect cell lines derived from lymphoid, myeloid, and monocytic lineages. Most leukocyte cell lines tested bound radiolabeled EV70 and were permissive for EV70 replication, suggesting that EV70, in contrast to other enteroviruses, has an in vitro tropism that includes lymphoid, monocytic, and myeloid cell lines. For some of the cell lines, virus binding and infection correlated with surface expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), an attachment protein for EV70 on HeLa cells. However, EV70 also adsorbed to and infected cell lines that expressed little or no DAF. In contrast to what was observed for HeLa cells, neither DAF-specific monoclonal antibodies nor phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment inhibited EV70 binding to permissive leukocyte cell lines, and antibody blockade of DAF had little or no effect on EV70 replication. We also found that neither the human coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor nor intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1, which mediate the entry of coxsackie B viruses and coxsackievirus A21, respectively, functions as a receptor for EV70. EV70 binding to all cell lines was sensitive to sialidase treatment and to inhibition of O glycosylation by benzyl N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminide. Taken together, these results suggest that a sialylated molecule(s) other than DAF serves as a receptor for EV70 on permissive human leukocyte cell lines."
