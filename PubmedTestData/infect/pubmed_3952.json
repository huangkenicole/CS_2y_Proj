        "To examine the characteristics of patients presenting to the emergency room and the specialist diabetes foot clinic with pedal osteomyelitis (PO).",
        "A retrospective study was conducted at a regional hospital. The charts of patients with suspected PO who presented during the period 1 January to 31 December 2011 were analysed. Demographics, biochemistry and microbiological data were obtained. Bone biopsies were performed by the attending clinician either during surgical removal of infected bone, or percutaneously under guided fluoroscopy through non-infected tissue.",
        "Sixty-six cases of osteomyelitis affecting 102 joints were noted. The study population consisted of 44 men, mean age 62.9 +/- 1.3 years, and 22 women, mean age of 57.6 +/- 10.6 years. Gram-positive bacteria were the predominating pathogens (p < 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in 36% of all bone biopsy cases. A predictive trend in HbA1c was observed,where every increase of 1% from the recommended level of 7% was associated with a 10% increase in the likelihood of receiving surgical intervention.",
        "S. aureus infection is a major cause of osteomyelitis in interphalangeal joints of the feet of diabetic patients.There is an apparent association with patients who present with diabetic foot osteomyelitis and sub-optimal glycaemic control, requiring surgical intervention."
