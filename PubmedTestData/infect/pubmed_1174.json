        "To study the susceptibility of rabbit to human cytomeglavirus (HCMV) in vivo and in vitro.",
        "Rabbit embryo lung (REL) cell monolayer were inoculated with HCMV AD169 strain. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed by microscope. HCMV antigen was detected by immunohistochemical method and viral particles were shown by electron microscopy. Human embryo lung (HEL) was taken control. Thirty New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups randomly, two were virus groups (group1, group2) and one was inactivated virus group (group3). 50 days later, the rabbits tissue lesions were observed by pathological techniques, HCMV DNA was analyzed by in situ hybridization.",
        "The CPE appeared 16 h post inoculation in REL cells as well as in HEL cells, at the same time, the HCMV antigen also was detected by immunhistochemistry and a large number of viral particles were manifested in the nucleus and cytoplasm of REL cells by electron microscope 36 h after virus inoculation. The extensive pathological damages in tissues of HCMV infected rabbits were observed and the viral DNA was also demonstrated in many tissues of HCMV infected rabbits.",
        "HCMV can infect REL cells and fulfil its replication cycle in vitro. HCMV AD169 strain can infect rabbits through intravenous injection and different infection models can be established by controlling the dosage of inoculated virus."
