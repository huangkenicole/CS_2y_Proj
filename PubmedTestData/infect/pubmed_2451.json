        "The expanding use of vascular catheters has increased the need to prevent hazardous infectious complications. Since bloodstream infection is the most common serious complication of indwelling vascular catheters, the proof that a potentially preventive approach is truly protective against clinical infection requires a significant reduction in the incidence of this infectious complication.Although catheter colonization is a prelude to infection, most colonized catheters do not result in catheter-related infection and, therefore, a mere reduction in catheter colonization does not, in and by itself, confirm protection against clinical infection. Adherence to optimal infection control guidelines is the primary measure for preventing infection, but in most instances the level of adherence to guidelines drops subsequent to the initial surge that follows the institutional adoption of educational programs. This explains the need to assess the potential clinical protection afforded by anti-infective technologies. In addition to improving patient care, a clinically protective anti-infective approach can also bring tremendous cost savings."
