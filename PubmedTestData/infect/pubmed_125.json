        "Since its first appearance in 2011, Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been repeatedly detected in aborted ruminant foetuses or severely malformed newborns whose mothers were naturally infected during pregnancy. However, especially the knowledge about dynamics of foetal infection in cattle is still scarce. Therefore, a total of 36 pregnant heifers were experimentally infected during two animal trials with SBV between days 60 and 150 of gestation. The foetuses were collected between 10 and 35\u00a0days after infection and virologically and pathologically investigated. Overall, 33 heifers yielded normally developed, macroscopically inconspicuous foetuses, but abundant virus replication was evident at the maternal/foetal interface and viral genome was detectable in at least one organ system of 18 out of 35 foetuses. One heifer was found to be not pregnant at autopsy. One of the animals aborted at day 4 after infection, viral RNA was detectable in the lymphatic tissue of the dam, in the maternal and foetal placenta, and in organs and lymphatic tissue of the foetus. In another foetus, SBV typical malformations like torticollis and arthrogryposis were observed. The corresponding dam was infected at day 90 of pregnancy and viral genome was detectable in the cerebellum of the unborn. Interestingly, no common patterns of infected foetal organs or maternal/foetal placentas could be identified, and both, sites of virus replication and genome loads, varied to a high degree in the individual foetuses. It is therefore concluded, that SBV infects in many cases also the bovine foetus of na\u00efve pregnant cattle, however, the experimentally observed low abortion/malformation rate is in concordance to the reported low rates in the field during the first outbreak wave following the introduction of SBV. This observation speaks for a natural resistance of most bovine foetuses even during the vulnerable phase of early pregnancy, which has to be further studied in the future."
