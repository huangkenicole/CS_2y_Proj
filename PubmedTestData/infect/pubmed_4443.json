        "Infectious complications following treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are important causes of morbidity and mortality. The spectrum and complexity of these infections is reflected by the severe net state of immunosuppression of AML patients, that is dynamic and continuously changing, the polypharmacy, including the widespread use of anti-infectives and the complex epidemiology of severe and frequently resistant pathogens afflicting these patients. Infectious diseases (ID) consultants having a critical mass of expertise and intimate knowledge of the intricacies of leukemia care, add considerable value in improving outcomes of patients with AML who develop infections. Furthermore, pharmaco-economic considerations such as length of stay, choice of cost-effective anti-infective program, infection control and antibiotic stewardship strategies create a delicate interplay of the ID consultant and the ecosystem of care of AML patients. This is an increasingly recognized area of cross collaboration and a productive direction for future collaborative practice models and research."
