      "AbstractText": [
        "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects 40-70% of adults in developed countries. HCMV proteins and DNA are detected in tumors and metastases, suggesting an association with increased invasion. We investigated HCMV infection in human breast cancer cell lines compared to fibroblasts, a component of tumors, and the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1). HCMV productively infected HEL299 fibroblasts and, to a lesser extent, Hs578T breast cancer cells. Infection of another triple-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231, and also MCF-7 cells, was extremely low. These disparate infection rates correlated with expression of <i>PDGFRA</i>, which facilitates HCMV uptake. Increasing <i>PDGFRA</i> expression in T-47D breast cancer and BCPAP thyroid cancer cells markedly increased HCMV infection. Conversely, HCMV infection decreased <i>PDGFRA</i> expression, potentially attenuating signaling through this receptor. HCMV infection of fibroblasts promoted the secretion of proinflammatory factors, whereas an overall decreased secretion of inflammatory factors was observed in infected Hs578T cells. We conclude that HCMV infection in tumors will preferentially target tumor-associated fibroblasts and breast cancer cells expressing PDGFR\u03b1. HCMV infection in the tumor microenvironment, rather than cancer cells, will increase the inflammatory milieu that could enhance metastasis involving lysophosphatidate."
