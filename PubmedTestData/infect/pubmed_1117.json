        "Staphylococcus aureus is a pathobiont capable of colonizing and infecting most tissues within the human body, resulting in a multitude of different clinical outcomes. Adhesion of S. aureus to the host is crucial for both host colonization and the establishment of infections. Underlying the pathogen's success is a complex and diverse arsenal of adhesins. In this review, we discuss the different classes of adhesins, including a consideration of the various adhesion sites throughout the body and the clinical outcomes of each infection type. The development of therapeutics targeting the S. aureus host-pathogen interaction is a relatively understudied area. Due to the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance, it is crucial that innovative and alternative approaches are considered. Neutralizing virulence factors, through the development of antivirulence agents, could reduce bacterial pathogenicity and the ever-increasing burden of S. aureus infections. This review provides insight into potentially efficacious adhesion-associated targets for the development of novel decolonizing and antivirulence strategies."
