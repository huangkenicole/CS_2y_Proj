        "A method is described for quantitation of enterovirus RNA in experimentally infected murine tissues. Viral RNA was extracted from tissue samples and amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR in the presence of an internal standard RNA. The ratio of PCR product derived from viral RNA and internal standard RNA was then determined using specific probes in a post-PCR electrochemiluminescent hybridization assay. This provided an estimate of the viral RNA copy number in the original sample, and detection of PCR product derived from internal standard RNA validated sample processing and amplification procedures. RNA copy number correlated with viral infectivity of cell culture-derived virus, and one tissue culture infective dose was found to contain approximately 10(3) genome equivalents. The ratio of RNA copy number to infectivity in myocardial tissue taken from mice during the acute phase of coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis was more variable ranging from 10(4)-10(7), and was dependent on the stage of infection, reflecting differential rates of clearance for viral RNA and viral infectivity. The assay is rapid, and could facilitate investigations which currently rely upon enterovirus quantitation by titration in cell culture. This would be useful for experimental studies of viral pathogenesis, prophylaxis and antiviral therapy."
