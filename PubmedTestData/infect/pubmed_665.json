        "A model of human hookworm infection has been defined with a strain of Ancylostoma ceylanicum that is known to be infective for humans. In the first experiment, dogs were infected with between 150 and 12,150 filariform larvae and followed up for six weeks. A direct relation was found between the size of infecting dose, fecal egg excretion, intestinal adult worm burden, and worm distribution in the bowel. Dogs with heavy infection developed bloody diarrhea and iron-deficient anemia. In the second experiment, dogs infected with 2,000 larvae excreted ova until autopsy 36 weeks after infection. Normocytic anemia and blood eosinophilia coincided with maximal egg excretion. Transitory lymphocyte stimulation was seen with adult worm antigen. The specific IgM antibody response was transient, but IgG antibodies persisted indefinitely. Marked skin immediate hypersensitivity and Arthus (but no delayed) hypersensitivity reactions were seen to injected larval and adult antigens. Thus, dogs develop both hookworm disease and chronic infections similar to those seen in humans."
