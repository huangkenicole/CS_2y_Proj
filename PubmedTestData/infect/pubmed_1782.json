        "To study the relation of preoperative infected urine and postprostatectomy wound infection in patients with and without indwelling bladder catheters.",
        "Patients undergoing prostatectomy were evaluated for the presence of infected urine prior to prostatectomy and postoperative wound infection. They were further divided into patients with indwelling urinary catheter and catheter-free patients. All had received antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "One hundred fifty consecutive patients undergoing open prostatectomy--mean age was 67 years; 100 patients with an indwelling catheter for a mean period of 50 days; 50 catheter-free patients.",
        "Wound infection was found in 19 of 81 (23.5%) and in 6 of 69 (8.7%) patients with infected and sterile urine, respectively (p = .028). In patients with indwelling catheters prior to operation, wound infection was 22.4% when urine was infected and 8.3% when it was not. In patients without catheters, infected urine was associated with 40% of wound infections, as compared with 8.9% of wound infections in patients with sterile urine. Organisms obtained from infected wound and urine were identical in 84% of cases. These results were obtained despite antibiotic prophylaxis.",
        "Wound infection has been demonstrated to be a postprostatectomy complication directly related to the presence of urinary infection at surgery; thus, elective prostatectomy should be deferred until urine becomes sterile."
