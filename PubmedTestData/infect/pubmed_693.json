        "High local delivery of anti-infectives to the lungs is required for activity against infections of the lungs. The present pandemic has highlighted the potential of pulmonary delivery of anti-infective agents as a viable option for infections like Covid-19, which specifically causes lung infections and mortality. To prevent infections of such type and scale in the future, target-specific delivery of drugs to the pulmonary region is a high-priority area in the field of drug delivery. The suboptimal effect of oral delivery of anti-infective drugs to the lungs due to the poor biopharmaceutical property of the drugs makes this delivery route very promising for respiratory infections. Liposomes have been used as an effective delivery system for drugs due to their biocompatible and biodegradable nature, which can be used effectively for target-specific drug delivery to the lungs. In the present review, we focus on the use of liposomal drug delivery of anti-infectives for the acute management of respiratory infections in the wake of Covid-19 infection."
