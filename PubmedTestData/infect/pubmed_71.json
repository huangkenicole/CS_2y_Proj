        "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a human pathogen that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, which can progress to severe neurological disease. EV-A71 infects humans via the human scavenger receptor B2 (hSCARB2). It can also infect neonatal mice experimentally. Wild-type (WT) EV-A71 strains replicate primarily in the muscle of neonatal mice; however, susceptibility lasts only for a week after birth. Mouse-adapted (MA) strains, which can be obtained by serial passages in neonatal mice, are capable of infecting both muscle and neurons of the central nervous system. It is not clear how the host range and tropism of EV-A71 are regulated and why neonatal mice lose their susceptibility during development. We hypothesized that EV-A71 infection in neonatal mice is mediated by mouse Scarb2 (mScarb2) protein. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells expressing mScarb2 were prepared. Both WT and MA strains infected mScarb2-expressing cells, but the infection efficiency of the WT strain was much lower than that of the MA strain. Infection by WT and MA strains <i>in vivo</i> was abolished completely in <i>Scarb2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. <i>Scarb2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice, in which Scarb2 expression was approximately half of that in <i>Scarb2</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice, showed a milder pathology than <i>Scarb2</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice after infection with the WT strain. The Scarb2 expression level in muscle decreased with aging, which was consistent with the reduced susceptibility of aged mice to infection. These results indicated that EV-A71 infection is mediated by mScarb2 and that the severity of the disease, the spread of virus, and the susceptibility period are modulated by mScarb2 expression. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> EV-A71 infects humans naturally but can also infect neonatal mice. The tissue tropism and severity of EV-A71 disease are determined by several factors, among which the virus receptor is thought to be important. We show that EV-A71 can infect neonatal mice using mScarb2. However, the infection efficiency of WT strains via mScarb2 is so low that an elevated virus-receptor interaction associated with mouse adaptation mutation and decrease in mScarb2 expression level during development modulate the severity of the disease, the spread of virus, and the susceptibility period in the artificial neonatal mice model."
