        "Due to its importance in public health, the infectivity of Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) originating from the bengalee, a variety of Lonchura striata, was examined in 3-day-old chickens. When chickens were inoculated orally with 10(4) CFU or 10(8) CFU of S. Typhimurium isolated from the bengalee and observed for 7 days, Salmonella was found in cloacal swabs from both groups. S. Typhimurium was also recovered from the liver, spleen and cecal of all the birds, and the counts in the cecal content were approximately 10(8) CFU per gram in each bird. Focal necrosis in the liver was observed in both groups. When chickens were inoculated with 10(4) CFU of S. Typhimurium originating from the bengalee or the chicken and observed for 21 days, more birds were positive for Salmonella in the former group than the latter group during the first week. S. Typhimurium was isolated from the liver, spleen and cecal content of both groups, and the counts of the cecal content were approximately 10(8) CFU per gram. Focal necrosis in the liver was noted in both groups. The results indicate that S. Typhimurium originating from the bengalee is infective and pathogenic to chickens, and the pathogenicity is almost similar to that of Salmonella derived from the chicken."
