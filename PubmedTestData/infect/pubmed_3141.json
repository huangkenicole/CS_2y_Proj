        "<i>Hirame novirhabdovirus</i> (HIRRV) infection is characterized by a pronounced viremia, and the high viral load is typically detected in immune-related organs and the circulatory system. In the present study, we demonstrated that HIRRV has the capacity to invade part of flounder membrane-bound IgM (mIgM<sup>+</sup>) B lymphocyte. Eight quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) standard curves involving HIRRV genomic RNA (gRNA), cRNA, and six mRNAs were established based on the strand-specific reverse transcription performed with tagged primers. It was revealed that viral RNA synthesis, especially the replication of gRNA, was inhibited in B cells, and the intracellular HIRRV even failed to produce infectious viral particles. Moreover, a range of genes with nucleic acid binding activity or related to viral infection were screened out based on the transcriptome analysis of HIRRV-infected B cells, and five molecules were further selected because of their different expression patterns in HIRRV-infected B cells and hirame natural embryo (HINAE) cells. The overexpression of these genes followed by HIRRV infection and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay revealed that the flounder B cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), a highly conserved zinc finger transcription factor, is able to inhibit the proliferation of HIRRV by binding with full-length viral RNA mainly via its zinc finger domains at the C terminus. In conclusion, these data indicated that the high transcriptional activity of BCL11A in flounder mIgM<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes is a crucial factor for the abortive infection of HIRRV, and our findings provide new insights into the interaction between HIRRV and teleost B cells. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> HIRRV is a fish rhabdovirus that is considered as an important pathogen threatening the fish farming industry represented by flounder because of its high infectivity and fatality rate. To date, research toward understanding the complex pathogenic mechanism of HIRRV is still in its infancy and faces many challenges. Exploration of the relationship between HIRRV and its target cells is interesting and necessary. Here, we revealed that flounder mIgM<sup>+</sup> B cells are capable of suppressing viral RNA synthesis and result in an unproductive infection of HIRRV. In addition, our results demonstrated that zinc finger protein BCL11A, a transcription factor in B cells, is able to suppress the replication of HIRRV. These findings increased our understanding of the underlying characteristics of HIRRV infection and revealed a novel antiviral mechanism against HIRRV based on the host restriction factor in teleost B cells, which sheds new light on the research into HIRRV control."
