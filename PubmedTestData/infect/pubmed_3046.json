        "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of infectious blindness and sexually transmitted bacterial infection globally. C. trachomatis contains a conserved chlamydial plasmid with eight coding sequences. Plasmid-cured Chlamydia strains are attenuated and display reduced infectivity in cell culture and <i>in vivo</i> genital infection of female mice. Mutants that do not express the plasmid-encoded proteins Pgp3, a secreted protein with unknown function, or Pgp4, a putative regulator of <i>pgp3</i> and other chromosomal loci, display an infectivity defect similar to plasmid-deficient strains. Our objective was to determine the combined and individual contributions of Pgp3 and Pgp4 to this phenotype. Deletion of <i>pgp3</i> and <i>pgp4</i> resulted in an infectivity defect detected by competition assay in cell culture and in mice. The <i>pgp3</i> locus was placed under the control of an anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter to examine the individual contributions of Pgp3 and Pgp4 to infectivity. Expression of <i>pgp3</i> was induced 100- to 1,000-fold after anhydrotetracycline administration, regardless of the presence or absence of <i>pgp4</i>. However, secreted Pgp3 was not detected when <i>pgp4</i> was deleted, confirming a role for Pgp4 in Pgp3 secretion. We discovered that expression of <i>pgp3</i> or <i>pgp4</i> alone was insufficient to restore normal infectivity, which required expression of both Pgp3 and Pgp4. These results suggest Pgp3 and Pgp4 are both required for infectivity during C. trachomatis infection. Future studies are required to determine the mechanism by which Pgp3 and Pgp4 influence chlamydial infectivity as well as the potential roles of Pgp4-regulated loci."
