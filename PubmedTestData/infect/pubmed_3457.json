        "The effect of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (ncpBVDV) infection on selected bovine alveolar macrophage (AM) functions was investigated. Alveolar macrophages were harvested from 2- to 6-month-old calves seronegative for BRSV and BVDV and inoculated with approximately 1 median cell culture infective dose of virus per AM. Control, BRSV infected, ncpBVDV-infected and BRSV-ncpBVDV coinfected AM cultures were evaluated for Fc receptor expression, phagosome-lysosome fusion, superoxide anion (O2-) production, and chemotactic activity on Days 1, 3, 5, and 7 post-infection. Both single and combined viral infections significantly depressed AM Fc receptor expression, phagosome-lysosome fusion, and secretion of chemotactic factors with a more significant synergistic depression seen in BRSV-ncpBVDV coinfection. Production of O2- by AM was not decreased by either BRSV or ncpBVDV infection, but was significantly decreased by coinfection with BRSV-ncpBVDV. The present study confirms previous reports of BRSV effects on AM functions and indicate that ncpBVDV affects AM functions in vitro. Coinfection with BRSV-ncpBVDV produced a synergistic depression on AM functions."
