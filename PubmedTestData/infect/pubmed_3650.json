        "Experimental infections of different salmonella serotypes were established in a commercial line of ducks to provide baseline information on which control measures might be based. The ducks were very resistant to systemic infection with Salmonella typhimurium, S. enteritidis and S. gallinarum within 36 h of hatching. This was associated with an inherent inability of the strains to multiply in the reticulo-endothelial system. The resistance was not associated with poor invasiveness or serum sensitivity. Individual strains of S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg and S. orion colonized the gut well and were excreted in the faeces for at least 6 weeks by ducks when they were infected orally within 2 days of hatching. The main sites of colonization were the caeca and, to a lesser extent, the crop. Viable counts of each inoculated strain in the caeca remained in excess of 10(6) c.f.u. 3 weeks after infection although the organisms had been cleared from the spleen by this time. Much less excretion occurred when the birds were infected at 3 weeks of age. When infected ducks, which had cleared themselves of infection, were challenged orally with the homologous strain expressing a different genetic marker, very low levels of excretion of the challenge strain were detected when compared with a control group. After infection low titres of circulating lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG antibodies were detected by an ELISA. Intestinal colonization of newly hatched ducks with an aroA strain of S. enteritidis resulted in extensive colonization which exerted an exclusion effect on the parent strain inoculated 24 h later."
