        "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) is the causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and gastric cancer (GC). While this bacterium infects 50% of the world's population, in Africa its prevalence reach as high as 80% as the infection is acquired during childhood. Risk factors for <i>H. pylori</i> acquisition have been reported to be mainly due to overcrowding, to have infected siblings or parent and to unsafe water sources. Despite this high <i>H. pylori</i> prevalence there still does not exist an African guideline, equivalent to the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report of the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group for the management of this infection. In this continent, although there is a paucity of epidemiologic data, a contrast between the high prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection and the low incidence of GC has been reported. This phenomenon is the so-called \"African Enigma\" and it has been hypothesized that it could be explained by environmental, dietary and genetic factors. A heterogeneity of data both on diagnosis and on therapy have been published. In this context, it is evident that in several African countries the increasing rate of bacterial resistance, mainly to metronidazole and clarithromycin, requires continental guidelines to recommend the appropriate management of <i>H. pylori</i>. The aim of this manuscript is to review current literature on <i>H. pylori</i> infection in Africa, in terms of prevalence, risk factors, impact on human health, treatment and challenges encountered so as to proffer possible solutions to reduce <i>H. pylori</i> transmission in this continent."
