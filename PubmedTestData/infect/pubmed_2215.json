        "The effect of mouse strain, age, sex, and the size of infective dose on the susceptibility to infection with the coccidium Cryptosporidium parvum Tyzzer, 1912 was determined using several murine models. Mice were infected with C. parvum oocysts originally of cervine origin, maintained by repeat passage in calves. All mice in the experimental groups proved susceptible to infection, though this resulted asymptomatic in all cases. C. parvum infection in BALB/c and Porton mice exhibited some variation. BALB/c mice demonstrated a longer prepatent period than Porton mice. They also produced a greater oocyst output over the patent period, though the differences were not statistically significant. Differences were observed between mice infected at either 3 or 4 weeks of age. Prepatent period was shorter in those mice infected at 3 weeks of age, reaching 100% infection rate by day 7 post-inoculation. The patent period was longer in younger mice showing that age at time of infection can modify the oocyst shedding profile. However, no sex related differences in the course of infection were observed. The effect of different infective doses of oocysts was analysed. The three doses used (10(4), 10(5), 10(6)) proved infective for all mice, there were no statistical differences in either prepatent or patent periods, or in the oocyst shedding profiles. Experimental cryptosporidiosis was also induced in cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice. Cyclophosphamide was orally administered by stomach tube at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day starting 10 days before the intragastric inoculation of 10(6) oocysts of C. parvum per mouse and continuing until the end of the experiment. Immunosuppressed mice had a shorter prepatent period, remained infected longer and shed more oocysts than immunocompetent mice. Immunosuppression produced high mortality rates; during the course of the experiment 44% of immunosuppressed-infected and 30% of immunosuppressed-uninfected mice died. There were no deaths in the untreated groups. Differences in the clinical course of the infection were also observed between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice; however, some mice recovered without immunosuppression withdrawal."
