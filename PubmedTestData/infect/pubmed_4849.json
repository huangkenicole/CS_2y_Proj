        "The authors review a series of 2,475 cases of patients operated for renal calculi and select 843 files in which the bacteriological study was performed. E. coli is the most common organism (29.8%) compared with Proteus which infects 21% of patients. 71.5% of the patients were infected. Bilateral calculi are the most heavily infected. Kidneys containing calculi which were subjected to a complex operation involving the parenchyma (nephrotomies) were the most difficult to disinfect, even in the absence of recurrence. Conversely, in the absence of recurrence, simple operations (pyelotomy, partial nephrectomy) provide disinfection in the majority of cases. In the authors' series, E. coli remains the organism most frequently encountered, even in cases of recurrence. Proteus and Pyocyanicus are the most difficult organisms to eradicate."
