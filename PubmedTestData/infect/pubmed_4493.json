        "Fasciola hepatica is one of the most common parasites in China that infects ruminants, especially cattle, sheep and goats, and causes considerable morbidity and economic losses in the animal husbandry. The climate in wide areas of China is suitable for the development of F. hepatica and its intermediate snail hosts. However, human infection with the fluke is not common. Up to now, 38 hospital patients and six infected individuals from two epidemiological surveys have been reported in the Chinese literature. F. gigantica infection in herbivorous animals is comparatively rare compared to F. hepatica infections, and only one case was reported in man (Wang, 1984). This paper reviews mainly human infections with F. hepatica in the Chinese literature. Animal infections of the parasite are also briefly described."
