        "Biological metal ions, including Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn ions, are necessary for the survival and the growth of all microorganisms. Their biological functions are linked to their particular chemical properties: they play a role in structuring macromolecules and/or act as co-factors catalyzing diverse biochemical reactions. These metal ions are also essential for microbial pathogens during infection: they are involved in bacterial metabolism and various virulence factor functions. Therefore, during infection, bacteria need to acquire biological metal ions from the host such that there is competition for these ions between the bacterium and the host. Evidence is increasingly emerging of \"nutritional immunity\" against pathogens in the hosts; this includes strategies making access to metals difficult for infecting bacteria. It is clear that biological metals play key roles during infection and in the battle between the pathogens and the host. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the strategies used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to access the various biological metals it requires. P. aeruginosa is a medically significant Gram-negative bacterial opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients and that is responsible for nosocomial infections worldwide."
