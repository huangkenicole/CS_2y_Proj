        "In a series of experiments, sporozoite stabilates of a Theileria lestoquardi (Lahr) and a T. annulata (Ankara) stock prepared from Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum ticks, were used to examine the infectivity of both parasite species for sheep and cattle and to study the development of cross-immunity between these parasite species. In the first experiment sheep and cattle were inoculated with T. lestoquardi sporozoites. Surviving animals and naive sheep and cattle were, in the second experiment, inoculated with T. annulata. In the third experiment, naive sheep and sheep previously infected with T. annulata, were inoculated with T. lestoquardi. The following responses to inoculations were monitored: clinical and haematological signs of infection, appearance of parasitic stages of the parasites in lymph node biopsies and in peripheral blood and serological response to T. lestoquardi and T. annulata schizont antigens. While T. lestoquardi readily infected sheep and caused severe disease, it did not infect cattle. On the other hand, T. annulata infected both cattle and sheep. However, whereas cattle became severely affected, infected sheep showed mild clinical symptoms only and piroplasms did not develop. Despite their different behaviour in the host species examined, cross-immunity studies suggested that the parasite species are very closely related. Experiments in sheep indicated that T. lestoquardi infection protected against subsequent T. annulata infection. On the other hand, recovery from T. annulata infection did not prevent infection by sporozoites of T. lestoquardi, resulting in the establishment of schizonts and their subsequent development into piroplasms, although it protected against the major clinical effects of T. lestoquardi infection."
