        "Due to its importance in public health, Salmonella Typhimurium originating from a naturally infected bengalee (Lonchura striata), a common cage bird, was examined for its infectivity and persistence for the same species. Eight birds per group for each experiment were used. When bengalees were inoculated orally with 10(2), 10(4) or 10(5) colony forming units (CFU) of S. Typhimurium and observed for 7 days, all the birds receiving 10(5) CFU were positive for the organism in the liver, spleen or the intestines, and necrotic foci in the liver were observed in 6 birds. When bengalees were inoculated with 10(5) CFU of S. Typhimurium and observed for 22 days, the organism was found in fecal samples throughout the experimental period and the maximum S. Typhimurium counts in feces were 3.9 x 10(8) CFU per gram. S. Typhimurium was recovered from the liver, spleen and intestines in 7 birds and necrotic foci in the liver were also observed in 7 birds. The results indicate that S. Typhimurium originating from a naturally infected bengalee is pathogenic to these birds and the persistence of the pathogen lasts at least for 22 days."
