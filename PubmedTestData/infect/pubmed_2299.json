        "The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the last century is alarming and calls for alternative, nonchemical treatment strategies. Thermal medicine uses heat for the treatment of infectious diseases but its use in facultative and obligate intracellular bacteria remains poorly studied. In this review, we summarize previous research on reducing the infectious burden of <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> and <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> by using water-filtered infrared A-radiation (wIRA), a special form of heat radiation with high tissue penetration and low thermal load on the skin surface. <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> is a thermosensitive bacterium causing chronic necrotizing skin disease. Therefore, previous data on wIRA-induced improvement of wound healing and reduction of wound infections is summarized first. Then, pathogenesis and treatment of infections with <i>M. ulcerans</i> causing Buruli ulcer and of those with <i>C. trachomatis</i> infecting the ocular conjunctiva and resulting in blinding trachoma are discussed. Both bacteria cause neglected tropical diseases and have similar geographical distributions. Results of previous <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> studies using wIRA on <i>M. ulcerans</i> and <i>C. trachomatis</i> infections are presented. Finally, technical aspects of using wIRA in patients are critically reviewed and open questions driving future research are highlighted. In conclusion, wIRA is a promising tool for reducing infectious burden due to intracellular bacteria such as <i>M. ulcerans</i> and <i>C. trachomatis</i>."
