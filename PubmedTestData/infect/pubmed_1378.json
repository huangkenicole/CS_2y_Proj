        "Endophthalmitis is a rare but severe form of ocular inflammation due to infection of the intraocular cavity that can lead to irreversible visual loss if not treated properly and timely. It can be classified as exogenous or endogenous based on the transmission route of the infectious source. Exogenous endophthalmitis occurs when infecting organisms gain entry into the eye via direct inoculation, while endogenous endophthalmitis occurs when infectious agents hematogenously spread into the eye from a distant focus of infection. The diagnosis of endophthalmitis depends mostly on the clinical findings on ophthalmological examination. Delayed diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis can lead to not only visual loss, but also increased risk of mortality. Since ocular and systemic symptoms of endophthalmitis are usually non-specific, early diagnosis relies on the alertness of clinicians. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are keys to saving the eye. Following advances in vitreoretinal pharmacotherapy and surgical technology, early surgical intervention is the current trend in the management of endophthalmitis."
