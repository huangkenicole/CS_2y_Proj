        "Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is responsible for respiratory disease and abortion in pregnant mares. Some high virulence isolates of EHV-1 also cause neurological disease. The pathogenesis of both abortion and neurological disease relates in part, to thrombus formation occurring in the pregnant uterus and central nervous system. The differences in disease outcome may relate to differing abilities of high and low virulence EHV-1 isolates to cause cell-associated viraemia, infect endothelial cells and cause thrombosis at sites distant from the respiratory tract. This study attempted to identify in vitro assays, which could be used to characterise the interaction between these isolates, equine endothelial cells and clotting factors. No significant difference was found between the growth kinetics of high and low virulence isolates of EHV-1 in polarised endothelial cells. For both isolates, virus was released preferentially from the apical surface of the polarised cells. The functional effects of viral infection on endothelial cells, with reference to virally-induced thrombosis were then investigated. Endothelial cells were grown on microcarrier beads, infected with EHV-1 and assayed for procoagulant activity. No significant difference in clotting time was observed between mock and EHV-1 infected endothelial cells in microcarrier cultures. Thus the degree of thrombosis may reflect a more complex interaction between endothelial cells, circulating leucocytes and other factors in the microenvironment."
