        "The complement fixation test by the microtiter method was applied to the serological diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial (RS) virus infection. When used as complement fixing antigens, untreated infected cell culture fluid, fluorocarbon-treated, and ether-treated materials showed no differences in antigenicity among them. The complement fixing antigenicity of bovine RS virus appeared in bovine kidney and Vero cell cultures for the first time 4 days after inoculation. Both the infectivity and complement fixing antigenicity reached a maximum 6 days after inoculation. In detecting complement fixing antibody from infected cattle, the most outstanding specific reaction was obtained when 5% fresh normal calf serum had been added to the diluent of complement. Neutralizing and complement fixing antibodies were examined in serum samples from two cattle in the course of experimental infection. It was found that both antibodies turned to be positive 2 weeks after inoculation. There was a linear correlation between neutralizing and complement fixing antibody titers, when serum samples from 40 natural cases were tested in the acute and convalescent stages. In addition, common antigenicity was demonstrated between the virus of bovine origin and the Long strain of human RS virus by complement fixation test."
