        "Cytomegaloviruses may infect mammals via oronasal route. However, up till now it remains unclear how this exposure leads to a general infection and shedding. To address this issue, BALB/c female mice were oronasally inoculated with either the highly passaged murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) Smith or the low passaged MCMV HaNa1. Virus titration showed a productive virus replication of both strains in the nasal mucosa from 1 dpi until the end of the experiment (14 dpi), in lungs from 5 until 14 dpi, and in submandibular glands from 7 until 14 dpi. In contrast to MCMV HaNa1, MCMV Smith also established a low level productive infection in abdominal organs (spleen, liver and kidneys) from 5 dpi (spleen), 7 dpi (liver), and 10 dpi (kidneys) until the end of the experiment. Co-culture showed that for both strains, cell-associated virus was detected in a non-infectious form in nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) from 1 until 14 dpi, in submandibular lymph nodes from 3 until 5 dpi, in deep cervical lymph nodes from 3 until 14 dpi, in mediastinal lymph nodes from 7 until 14 dpi, in spleen from 5 until at least 10 dpi and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at 7 and 10 dpi. The present study shows that upon oronasal exposure, MCMV first enters the nasal mucosa and NALT, from where the virus disseminates to the spleen possibly via the draining lymphatic system and blood; a subsequent cell-associated viremia transports MCMV to submandibular glands and for MCMV Smith also to liver and kidneys, where a second productive replication starts."
