        "Oocysts obtained from a guanaco and an alpaca with natural infections were identified as Eimeria macusaniensis and evaluated for host specificity and infectivity over time. In 3 separate trials conducted over 4 yr, 4 adult llamas were fed 500-5,000 sporulated oocysts obtained from guanaco feces stored under laboratory conditions for 41-84 mo. Infections with prepatent periods of 36-41 days and patent periods of 38-55 days developed in 4/4 llamas. In a fourth trial, 3 adult llamas and 1 alpaca were each fed 1,000 sporulated E. macusaniensis oocysts obtained from alpaca feces stored in the laboratory for 3 mo. Infections with prepatent periods of 33-34 days and patent periods of 14-20 days developed in 3/3 llamas. Infection in the alpaca had a prepatent period of 58 days and a patent period of 1 day. Clinical signs associated with infection, if any, were minimal and included increased fecal mucus and occasional soft feces. These results provide evidence that E. macusaniensis is a single species transmissible amongst alpacas, llamas, and guanacos and that oocysts of this species can remain infective for many years."
