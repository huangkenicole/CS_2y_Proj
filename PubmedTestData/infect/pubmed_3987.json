        "Clostridium difficile is the most commonly identified infective cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Broad spectrum antibiotics, are most frequently incriminated, although short (<3 day) antibiotic courses cause fewer episodes. Gold standard cell-culture based cytotoxin assays have been compared to rapid immunoassays, which are less effective, especially since toxin A negative, toxin B positive strains have been shown to be truly virulent. Details of colonization and adherence mechanisms have been revealed, and clonal spread has been demonstrated. The mainstay of treatment of C. difficile infection remains metronidazole. Justified fears over resistance are leading to development of alternative therapeutic strategies. These include a toxin binding polymer and ongoing biotherapy research. An antibody rise to toxin A during an episode of C. difficile diarrhoea protects against recurrence, and trials are in progress to investigate immunization: a toxoid vaccine which is immunogenic and safe in healthy volunteers shows promise for the future."
