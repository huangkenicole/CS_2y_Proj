        "A model for studying the pathogenesis of virulent arenavirus infection was developed by adapting Pichinde virus to produce lethal infections of inbred guinea pigs. This adapted Pichinde virus retained low virulence for primates, thus potentially reducing the biohazard to investigators. Whereas all inbred (strain 13) guinea pigs were infected and killed by 3 plaque-forming units or more of adapted Pichinde virus injected subcutaneously, outbred (Hartley strain) guinea pigs were relatively resistant. All infected, inbred guinea pigs died at 13 to 19 days after inoculation, with viremias in excess of 5 log(10) plaque-forming units/ml, severe lymphopenia (<1,000/mm(3)), and elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase levels. Immunofluorescent antibody examination of tissues and infectivity titrations of tissue homogenates obtained at 3- to 4-day intervals demonstrated significant viral replication in all visceral tissues examined, but not in brain. Livers of all moribund guinea pigs contained moderate to severe hepatocellular necrosis and diffuse fatty change. Splenic red pulp and adrenal cortical tissues were engorged with blood and contained necrotic foci. Pancreatic acinar tissues were atrophied and vacuolated; lung sections typically contained areas of moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia. Inflammatory cells were conspicuously absent from all lesions. The virological and pathological features of adapted Pichinde infection in guinea pigs are remarkably similar to those described for Lassa virus infections in rhesus monkeys and humans, suggesting that this model might provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of Lassa fever in humans."
