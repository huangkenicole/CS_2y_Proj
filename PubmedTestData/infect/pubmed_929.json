        "The pathogenicity of avian nephritis virus (ANV) for embryonating hen's eggs was studied by various routes of inoculation. When inoculated with ANV by the yolk sac route, 6-day-old embryos showed the highest susceptibility and all of them died 3 to 14 days postinoculation (PI). They manifested hemorrhage and edema of the whole body (3 to 6 days PI) and stunting (7 to 14 days PI). The 50% egg-infective dose of the virus by yolk sac inoculation coincided well with the virus titer expressed in plaque-forming units determined on the monolayer of chicken kidney cell cultures. The virus could be passed serially through the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of embryonating hen's eggs. In these eggs the CAM presented edematous thickening at the inoculation site, and the embryo stunting. when inoculated by the CAM route, high virus doses killed all embryos, but low virus doses allowed some of the infected embryos to hatch normally. When inoculated by the allantoic cavity route, the virus did not multiply in the allantoic cavity of embryonating eggs, but some of these eggs became infected. Fluorescent antigens were present only in the kidneys and CAM of embryos infected with the virus. The virus was recovered at a low rate from cloacal swabs of chicks from normally hatched eggs inoculated with the virus by the CAM route. These chicks were variable in growth, but had antibodies against the virus and developed nephritis at 36 days of age."
