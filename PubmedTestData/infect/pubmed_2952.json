        "Megalocytivirus infection is a major threat in rock bream aquaculture in Korea. To produce a highly concentrated megalocytivirus, primary cells, established cell line and persistently infected cell line were used in this study. Megalocytivirus was inoculated in primary fin cell cultures of red sea bream (Pagrus major), rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) and produced at similar concentrations of 10<sup>8.99 - 9.88</sup> viral particles/mL in all cultures while produced 10<sup>7.31</sup> viral particles/mL in grunt fin (GF) cell line. Since only red sea bream fin culture was amenable to subculturing for more than 100 times, it was established into Pagrus major fin (PMF) cell line. A persistently infected PMF cell line (PI-PMF) was obtained by continuous subculturing every 7 days as a batch culture system (PI-PMF-B) after infecting with megalocytivirus. Virus in supernatant of PI-PMF-B was maintained at high concentrations throughout over 50 consecutive subcultures in a relatively narrow range from 10<sup>8.33</sup> to 10<sup>8.94</sup> viral particles/mL with high level of CPE. For a more efficient and convenient production, a semi-batch culture system (PI-PMF-S) was developed in which culture media were exchanged at intervals of 3 days without subculturing for more than 50 media exchanges. Despite low virus productivity in a single cell (specific virus productivity, SVP), total cell number was increased in PI-PMF-S, allowing us to efficiently obtain a much higher concentration of virus (10<sup>8.56</sup> to 10<sup>9.75</sup> viral particles/mL) than in PMF-B. This is the first study to report detailed new methods for continuous and efficient production of high concentrations of megalocytivivrus with characterization of viral propagation in persistently infected cells."
