        "A series of cases infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria was studied to determine the spectrum of disease, antimicrobial susceptibility, treatment, and outcome.",
        "The cases identified as infections with rapidly growing mycobacteria in Ramathibodi Hospital from January 1993 to December 1999 were retrospectively studied.",
        "Most of the cases had no underlying disease. Only two cases were HIV-infected patients. The presenting clinical features were lymphadenitis (seven cases), skin and/or subcutaneous abscess (seven cases), localized eye infection (four cases), pulmonary infection (one case), and chronic otitis media (one case). Four of seven cases with lymphadenitis had Sweet's syndrome, and one had psoriasis as an associated skin manifestation. Anemia was present in five cases, and improved with treatment of the primary disease. The organisms were Mycobacterium chelonae/abscessus group (17 cases) and Mycobacterium fortuitum group (three cases). Susceptibility patterns of the organisms showed susceptibility to amikacin, netilmicin, and imipenem. M. fortuitum group was susceptible to more antibiotics than M. chelonae/abscessus group. The clinical responses corresponded to the antimicrobial susceptibility. Combinations of two or more drugs were used for the medical treatment. Surgical resection was performed where possible, to reduce the load of the organism, especially in cases with very resistant organisms.",
        "Infections with rapidly growing mycobacteria can occur in apparently normal hosts. The clinical syndrome is variable. The pathology is nonspecific. Clinical responses varied, but seemed to correlate with the in vitro susceptibility result. More studies are needed to enable us to deal with this infection effectively."
