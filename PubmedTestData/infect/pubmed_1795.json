        "Two strains of Trichostrongylus colubriformis of ovine origin, one resistant and one susceptible to thiabendazole, were compared during experimental infection in rabbits. Groups of rabbits were infected with 5000 infective larvae (L3) of either the resistant or the susceptible strain. On days 21 and 42 post-infection (p.i.), 5 rabbits of each group were killed and the small intestine divided into three sections for worm counts and histological or biochemical analysis. Faecal egg counts were performed twice a week from day 15 to day 42 p.i. The physiology of the worms was characterised by in vitro acetylcholinesterase secretion of adult worms. The host inflammatory response was determined by peroxidase activity in mucosal homogenates and by histological counts of mast cells and eosinophils. Infectivity was not significantly different between the two strains. However, egg production was delayed and was significantly lower for the resistant strain. Conversely, in vitro secretion of resistant worms was significantly higher than the susceptible ones. The mucosal homogenetates of rabbits infected with the resistant strain had significantly higher levels of peroxidase activity in the duodenum on days 21 and 42 p.i. Mast cell counts were also significantly higher in the duodenum on day 42 p.i., in rabbits infected with the resistant strain. No difference was observed in the eosinophil counts. These results suggest that genetic variation in the nematode, such as anthelminthic resistance, is associated with variations in worm biology and physiology as well as differences in the inflammatory response of the host."
