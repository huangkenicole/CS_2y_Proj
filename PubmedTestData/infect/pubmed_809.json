        "The synergistic interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and virulent or attenuated murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) were compared in vivo. Virulent MCMV challenge at a dose of 5 X 10(5) pfu/mouse intraperitoneally, followed by intranasal superinfection with 5 X 10(6) cfu/mouse of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 48 h resulted in greater than 80% mortality, apparently owing to a failure of pulmonary clearance mechanisms. Single infections, or the use of attenuated MCMV in synergistic infections, did not result in significant morbidity or mortality. Infection with virulent MCMV in vivo resulted in the rapid spread of virus to the lung, liver, and spleen, followed later by spread to the salivary glands. Attenuated virus was detected in salivary glands only. Virulent MCMV was more effective in adsorbing to, or infecting, spleen cells in vitro than attenuated virus. Viral neutralization experiments using anti-viral serum, rabbit complement, and anti-mouse IgG confirmed the presence of a nonneutralizing antibody on the surface of the virulent virus. Our results suggest that the presence of the nonneutralizing antibody on virulent MCMV allows the virus to preferentially infect, or adsorb to, Fc+ cells in the peritoneum. These cells may then carry the virus, via the lymphatic circulation, to other areas of the body, resulting in the replication of virus in multiple organs. Virus replication in the lung may, in part, be the cause of the observed suppression of pulmonary clearance."
