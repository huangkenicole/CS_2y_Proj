        "In this study, the virulence of the red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) subtype II (17RbGs isolate) and a novel RSIV mixed subtype I/II (17SbTy isolate), which was genetically characterized in a previous study, were compared. The infectivity to rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) determined by infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) revealed that 17RbGs isolate was significantly more infective than 17SbTy isolate using both intraperitoneal injection and bath immersion. In a cohabitation challenge test that mimicked natural conditions, the cumulative mortality of the donor (RSIV-injected rock bream) and the recipient (cohabited na\u00efve rock bream) was significantly higher in the 17RbGs group than in the 17SbTy group, regardless of RSIV injected doses, supporting the correlation between genetic mutation and pathogenicity. In addition, the maximum viral shedding ratio identified from RSIV-infected rock bream suggested that viral transmission through infection with the 17SbTy isolate could have a lower relative risk than that of infection with the 17RbGs isolate. In particular, the odds ratio based on the spleen index after 17RbGs infection was 55.00, which was inconsistent with that of 17SbTy infection (19.38), hence supporting the virulence difference between RSIVs. Furthermore, the expression of viral genes, including DNA membrane and myristoylated protein genes with insertion and deletion mutations, and that of caspase-8, which is related to caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by RSIV infection, were significantly upregulated at 11 days post 17RbGs-infection compared to that following 17SbTy infection. Notably, although viral genes were highly expressed in the early infection stage and caspase-8 was upregulated, the low caspase-3 expression may have inhibited apoptosis, reflecting the difference in virulence between different RSIV isolates. Several virulence factors, including pathogenicity, viral shedding ratio, odds ratio, and gene expression, support that RSIV mixed subtype I/II may be a less pathogenic RSIV isolate compared with general RSIV subtype II in a natural environment."
