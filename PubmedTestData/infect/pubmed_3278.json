      "AbstractText": [
        "The urinary tract is among the most common sites of bacterial infection and E. coli is by far the most common infecting agent in children and adults of both sexes. In an attempt to evaluate the intrinsic virulence of E. coli uroisolates from children, 54 strains were assessed by using PCR for the presence of five representative genetic determinants coding for adherence systems (pap, sfa/foc, afa), and toxins (hly and cnf). The prevalence of pap, sfa/foc and afa genes was 55%, 54%, and 44%, respectively. Hemolysin-encoding gene hly was detected in 55% strains, while cnf was exhibited by 35% of the screened E. coli isolates. Among the 39 PCR positive strains isolated from children's urine cultures the co-occurrence of the various targeted virulence genes was detected in 30 strains, the virulence profiles identified suggesting the presence of their localization on chromosomal regions known as pathogencity-associated islands. The rapid and reliable detection of the intrinsic virulence potential by this molecular approach could be very useful when evaluating the importance of microorganism pathogenicity versus host's susceptibility for developing an overt symptomatology of infection."
