        "Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) has recently emerged as an important disease of pigs in North America, Europe and Asia. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine parvovirus (PPV) have been isolated from affected pigs. To investigate the pathogenicity of these isolates, groups of colostrum-deprived conventional pigs were inoculated with PCV2 alone (n=4), PPV alone (n=3) or dually with PCV2 and PPV (n=7) and examined post mortem between 21 and 26 days post-infection (dpi). Two control pigs were inoculated with an uninfected cell culture lysate. All pigs that received both viruses became dull at approximately 10-12 dpi and six of these animals subsequently developed jaundice. Hepatomegaly and enlarged kidneys were prominent post-mortem findings in these animals. Histopathological examination revealed severe macrophage infiltration, syncytia formation and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear amphophilic inclusion bodies in lymphoid tissues. Granulomatous lesions were apparent in liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, myocardium, intestines, testis, brain and salivary, thyroid and adrenal glands. Abundant PCV2 antigen was detected in affected tissues. Only one of the four pigs inoculated with PCV2 alone developed clinical signs, but they all had histopathological lesions which, although less severe, were similar to those in the dually infected animals. The control pigs and those infected with PPV alone remained clinically normal and did not have gross lesions. The only histopathological lesion seen in these animals was mild interstitial nephritis in the pigs infected with PPV alone. These results indicate that lesions of PMWS can be induced by inoculating pigs with PCV2 alone, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates. Concurrent infection with PPV increased the severity of the lesions, suggesting that co-factors are important in the pathogenesis of PMWS."
