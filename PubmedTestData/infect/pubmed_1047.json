      "AbstractText": [
        "The pathogenicity of a single infection with Eperythrozoon suis and of a mixed infection of E. suis and Babesia trautmanni in experimentally-infected pigs, was described. In the pigs with a single infection, parasitaemia of E. suis was observed 4 days after blood inoculation. Although parasitaemia with this parasite was also observed on the 4th day in a mixed infection, the parasitaemia of B. trautmanni was not noted until 14 days after inoculation at a period when that of E. suis had started to fall. No parasitaemia was observed in any of the pigs in the splenectomized and unsplenectomized uninoculated control animals. The pigs carrying either single or mixed infections had pyrexia and their temperatures were consistently higher than those of the control animals. Infected pigs also showed anaemia with significant decline in Pcv, Hb and RBC values. The total WBC count rose in the infected pigs and the rise was more pronounced in pigs carrying E. suis alone. In addition, it was only in pigs infected by E. suis alone that a decline in the percentage of neutrophils and a rise in percentage lymphocytes was observed."
