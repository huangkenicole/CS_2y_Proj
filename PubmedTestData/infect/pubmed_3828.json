        "Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) are the major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease in young children. Although less so with CV-A16, both viruses are associated with serious neurological syndromes, but the differences between their central nervous system infections remain unclear. We conducted a comparative infection study using clinically-isolated CV-A16 and EV-A71 strains in a 1-day-old mouse model to better understand the neuropathology and neurovirulence of the viruses. New serotype-specific probes for in situ hybridization were developed and validated to detect CV-A16 and EV-A71 RNA in infected tissues. Demonstration of CV-A16 virus antigens/RNA, mainly in the brainstem and spinal cord neurons, confirmed neurovirulence, but showed lower densities than in EV-A71 infected animals. A higher lethal dose<sub>50</sub> for CV-A16 suggested that CV-A16 is less neurovirulent. Focal virus antigens/RNA in the anterior horn white matter and adjacent efferent motor nerves suggested that neuroinvasion is possibly via retrograde axonal transport in peripheral motor nerves."
