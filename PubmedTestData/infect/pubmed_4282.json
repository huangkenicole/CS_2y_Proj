        "Lactation in sheep and mice was associated with a marked increase in susceptibility to newly acquired infection with Haemonchus contortus and Nematospiroides dubius, respectively. In sheep this increased susceptibility to infection with H. contortus occurred in late pregnancy and during lactation and was seen when the ewes were infected with both a single large dose of infective larvae and a \"trickle\" infection of 200 and 400 infective larvae of H. contortus given weekly for 14 weeks. Nonlactating ewes whose lactation had been terminated were able to reject the parasites which had been acquired in late pregnancy. A relaxation in the protective immune response was evident in immunized mice infected during lactation with N. dubius. However, despite this periparturient relaxation of immunity mice were capable of inducing a marked passive transfer of immunity to their offspring. Thus, neonatal mice born of mothers one or two months after the end of the immunizing schedule were protected against infection with N. dubius at 12 or 20 days of age."
