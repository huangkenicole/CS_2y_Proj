      "AbstractText": [
        "To determine the appropriate timing for surgical intervention in infective endocarditis (IE), we evaluated 24 patients (17 males, 6 females, with one included twice) who underwent surgical intervention for IE of native valves (NVE, n = 21) and prosthetic valves (PVE, n = 3) between January 1989 and September 1994. The mean age was 41 +/- 13 years (range 6 to 64 years). The most common infective organisms were Staphylococcus (33% of NVE) and Streptococcus (19% of NVE), with five NVE patients (24%) negative for blood culture. The PVE patients showed a different pattern of infecting organisms, with Enterococcus in one and Pseudomonas in another. From the resected valve culture and pathological findings, 12 patients were in the active stage at operation. Two in-hospital deaths occurred for a mortality rate of 8.7% (2/23). Further, surgical interventions were performed earlier with Staphylococcal infections than with Streptococcal infections, because hemodynamic compromise presented more progressively in the former. Also resected valve cultures and the pathological findings showed that a persistent infectious process existed in many cases of Staphylococcal infection in spite of intensive antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, we suggest that internists make referrals for surgical intervention for patients with NVE or PVE as early as possible in the active stage of infection."
