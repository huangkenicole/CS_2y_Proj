      "AbstractText": [
        "An outbreak caused by H7N3 low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) occurred in commercial turkey farms in the states of North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC), United States in March of 2020. Subsequently, H7N3 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected on a turkey farm in SC. The infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity of the H7N3 HPAIV and two LPAIV isolates, including one with a deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein stalk, were studied in turkeys and chickens. High infectivity [<2 log<sub>10</sub> 50% bird infectious dose (BID<sub>50</sub>)] and transmission to birds exposed by direct contact were observed with the HPAIV in turkeys. In contrast, the HPAIV dose to infect chickens was higher than for turkeys (3.7 log<sub>10</sub> BID<sub>50</sub>), and no transmission was observed. Similarly, higher infectivity (<2-2.5 log<sub>10</sub> BID<sub>50</sub>) and transmissibility were observed with the H7N3 LPAIVs in turkeys compared to chickens, which required higher virus doses to become infected (5.4-5.7 log<sub>10</sub> BID<sub>50</sub>). The LPAIV with the NA stalk deletion was more infectious in turkeys but did not have enhanced infectivity in chickens. These results show clear differences in the pathobiology of AIVs in turkeys and chickens and corroborate the high susceptibility of turkeys to both LPAIV and HPAIV infections."
