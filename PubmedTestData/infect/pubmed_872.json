        "Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been recognized as clonal non-neoplastic lymphoproliferative diseases. However, some reports of cases with a multiphenotypic expansion of EBV-infected lymphocytes give rise to questions of how EBV infects multiphenotypic lymphocytes and whether chronic active EBV infection is a truly monoclonal lymphoproliferative disease. We report two patients with chronic active EBV infection who showed expansion of multiphenotypic EBV-infected lymphocytes. EBV DNA was detected in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and in B cells from pleural fluid of one patient and in T and B cells from a cervical lymph node of the other patient by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although real-time PCR showed that there were equally high loads of EBV genomes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the pleural fluid, Southern blot hybridization with terminal repeats of the EBV genome showed a single band of the same molecular weight in three tissue samples from the patient. The results indicated biphenotypic expansions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infected with the same clone of EBV. Furthermore, bisulfite PCR analysis showed hypermethylated status in the Cp region in the two patients regardless of their cell populations. There has been a discrepancy between clonality and expansion of multiphenotypic EBV-infected lymphocytes. We speculate that lymphoid progenitor cells that have not differentiated into T and B cell progenitors are infected with EBV, resulting in clonal expansion of EBV-infected multiphenotypic cells."
