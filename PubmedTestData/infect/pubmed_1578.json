        "In this work, analysis of cardiovascular system under the influence of RNA virus infection has been performed from a thermodynamic perspective. An exergetic efficiency of the system has been defined for this purpose. Results show that except for asymptomatic case, the exergetic efficiency reduces as the viral load goes up. Dynamics of viral growth along with change in efficiency is examined under different parameters such as virus production rate, infectivity rate and cell death rate. Results show that the drop in the exergetic efficiency of cardiovascular system under viral infection can be up to about 20%. Under infection, the exergy requirement of the lungs increases significantly as the work rate required by lungs increase by up to 240%."
