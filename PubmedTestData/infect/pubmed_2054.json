        "The pathogenicity of two genetically different strains of bovine adenovirus type 2 (BAV-2) was tested in a double cross experimental infection of weaned lambs and calves. One of the virus strains was isolated from cattle and represented BAV-2 subgroup \"A\", while the other was isolated from sheep and belonged to subgroup \"B\" (Bel\u00e1k et al., 1983). The two virus strains caused infection both in lambs and calves; the viruses were repeatedly reisolated and definite seroconversion was found in all four groups. However, remarkable differences were observed in the pathogenicity: the most intensive virus multiplication and shedding, the most severe clinical symptoms and histopathological lesions were observed in the lamb group infected with the ovine isolate."
