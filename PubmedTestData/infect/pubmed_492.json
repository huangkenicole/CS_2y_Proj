        "The authors report biomorphological changes of Plasmodium inui gametocytes during the natural infection of spleenless Macaca fascicularis. The infection was controlled up to the 42th day by smears produced by pricks into their ears (P.O.) and on blood taken at the same time by A. stephensi (P.M.). The first oocystes appeared on the 8th day after the infection in mosquitoes fed on the monkey parasitised in the eight day after splenectomy, as gametocytaemia was not detectable yet in the P.O. smears. The infectivity of gametocytes is highest on the 13rd day for a 152/10(4) parasitaemia. The first sporozoites appeared on the 18th day at 25 degrees C after the infecting meal. The sporozoites were infecting for a second monkey. Four morphological types (O, I, II and III) gametocytes were identified. They corresponded to the same types previously described in rodent Plasmodium. The maximum of infectivity coincided with a sudden increase in mosquitoe macrogametocytaemia; on the other hand the infectivity was very weak during the following peek of macrogametocytaemia which corresponded however to the maximum of parasitaemia (1 318/10(4) 18 days after splenectomy). When infectivity was important, there was a greater number of type O and I gametocytes in P.M. than in P.O. Eventually, the behaviour of P. inui gametocytes is, for the mainly, almost the same as that of rodent Plasmodium. However, it is to be noted that the identification of the 4 morphological types in P. inui is easier in macrogametocytes than in microgametocytes. The reverse had been observed in rodent Plasmodium."
