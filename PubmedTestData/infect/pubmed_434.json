        "This study investigates the effect of host desiccation on entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) development, emergence, infectivity, and cross-protection against secondary environmental stress. Galleria mellonella hosts infected with the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae A10 were allowed to dehydrate in an environmental chamber for up to 56 days at 23 degrees C achieving a weight loss of approximately 86% by day 44 post-infection. Host carcasses were rehydrated on water-saturated filter paper in White traps to collect emergent infective juveniles (IJ) at specific time intervals. Populations were counted with an apparent peak coinciding with desiccated hosts rehydrated at 24-day post-infection. Desiccation-stressed IJ populations from each time interval were tested for infectivity, and cross-resistance to secondary temperature and pH stresses and were found to have significant increases in both infectivity and protection from extremes of temperature and pH compared with controls. Total aqueous soluble protein profiles from control and desiccation-stressed IJs were analyzed using 10% SDS Laemmli gels. Several novel proteins were over-expressed in EPN from hosts subjected to desiccation suggesting the induction and expression of stress response genes."
