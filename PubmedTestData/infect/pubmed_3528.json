        "The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is highly adapted to the human stomach, and a high level of polymorphism is observed among clinical isolates. This polymorphism may be the consequence of adaptive changes during colonization, making a strain better able to survive, to evade the immune system, and to provoke a chronic infection. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of diversity in H. pylori, mouse models of single infections, coinfections, and superinfections were developed. These experimental infections were conducted with strain SS1, well known to be mouse adapted, and with two strains freshly isolated from infected patients: Hp141 and Hp145. Genetic modifications occurring in these strains were studied over time by comparing randomly selected colonies of the emerging strains to those of the infecting strains by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting with six different primers and by using PCR to amplify the vacA and cagA genes. We showed that, regardless of the number of infecting strains, only one emerged from the animals and that the establishment of a first strain thwarted the implantation of a second strain. During both a single infection and a coinfection with SS1, Hp141 was replaced by a genetic variant (Hp141v) that overcame SS1 in coinfection experiments. Hp141v exhibited a deletion of a 102-bp repeated sequence within the ppk gene, which encodes polyphosphate kinase (PPK), an enzyme involved in the physiological adaptation of the microbial cell to nutritional and environmental stresses. The deletion led to higher enzymatic activity of PPK, and the variant exhibited a better capacity to colonize mice. Considering that the modified gene is known to be involved in adaptation to a new environment, our results are consistent with an adaptive change in strain Hp141 and suggest that PPK is an important virulence factor in H. pylori."
