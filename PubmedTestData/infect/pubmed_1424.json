        "Gnathostoma spinigerum is the major causative agent of human gnathostomiasis, a parasitic zoonosis with a great variety of clinical manifestations. Generally, humans are infected by consumption of third-stage larvae (L3) of G. spinigerum in infected hosts in the form of partially cooked or uncooked food. Surveys of the contamination of Gnathostoma spp. L3 in swamp eels are useful for prevention and control of diseases and have been continuously performed in Thailand. The author performed a retrospective study on 33 previous cross-sectional surveys with geographical data and the prevalence of Gnathostoma spp. L3 that covered 12 provinces in Thailand. The relation between rainfall (derived from the geographical data) and the prevalence of Gnathostomo spp. L3 in swamp eels (derived from the overall infection rate of Gnathostoma spp. L3) was investigated. The least-square equation plot rainfall (y) versus prevalence (x) is y= 9.68x + 1,035.12 (r = 0.83; p < 0.01). A significant correlation was discerned between rainfall and the prevalence of eel infection but not for the season of the survey. Similar to the previous study, the prevalence of eel infection may depend on rainfall rather than season. However, this study focused on only 33 cross-sectional surveys in Thailand; further similar study in other countries to assess the correlation between rainfall and the prevalence of infection is required to substantiate this conclusion."
