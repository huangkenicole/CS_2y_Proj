        "The protective role of neutrophils on intranasal infection of influenza virus was investigated in 3 strains of tumor-bearing mice with neutrophilic leukocytosis. In vitro multiplication of influenza virus was inhibited by neutrophils from both normal and tumor-bearing mice, and the inhibitory effect of neutrophils was augmented by an addition of fMLP to the culture. Pulmonary virus infectivities in the early phase after infection decreased in such ICR and BALB/c mice, and virus elimination in the late phase was accelerated in the ICR mice. However, no decrease in pulmonary virus infectivity was observed in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Intranasal administration of fMLP into normal and tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice after infection significantly inhibited the virus propagation in the lungs. The decrease in neutrophil infiltration into the lung in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice was confirmed from histological observations of the lung and lung lavage after infection and from analysis of the neutrophil chemotactic activity induced by fMLP. This might be responsible for the high level of pulmonary virus titer in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Phagocytic activities of alveolar macrophages and productions of neutralizing antibody were suppressed in the 3 strains of tumor-bearing mice. These observations indicated that neutrophils could be significant effector cells as a host defense mechanism against influenza virus infection in vivo, and infiltration and functional activation of neutrophils could play a significant role in virus elimination from the infected site. Furthermore, the inhibition of virus propagation by neutrophils in vitro was almost completely abrogated by an addition of ZnSO4, suggesting that calprotectin could inhibit influenza virus multiplication."
