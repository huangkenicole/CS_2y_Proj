        "Combinations of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and either of two swine influenza viruses (H1N1 or H3N2) were administered intranasally and by aerosol to six- to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs. The clinical responses, gross respiratory lesions and growth performances of these pigs were studied and compared with those of single (PRCV, H1N1 or H3N2) and mock-infected animals. PRCV infection caused fever, growth retardation and lung lesions, but no respiratory symptoms. Infection with swine influenza viruses caused rather similar, mild symptoms of disease, with H1N1 infection being the least severe. Combined infections with influenza viruses and PRCV did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses. Furthermore, viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from 'single' than 'dual' infected animals, suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of PRCV and swine influenza virus."
