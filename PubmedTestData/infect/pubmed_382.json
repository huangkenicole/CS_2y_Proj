        "We examined the effects of electrical stimulation on HIV-1-adsorbed MAGIC-5 (MAGIC-5/HIV-1) cells and unadsorbed MAGIC-5 (MAGIC-5) cells. When MAGIC-5 cells were stimulated by a constant d.c. potential of 1.0 V (vs Ag/Agcl) immediately after HIV-1(LAI) infection, infectivity was more affected by electrical stimulation than by cell membrane damage. In particular, after application of potential at 1.0 V for 5 min, about 1% of the membranes of the MAGIC-5/HIV-1(LAI) cells were damaged, but the infectivities of both HIV-1(LAI) and HIV-1(NL43-luc) cells decreased about 37 and 44%, respectively (p < 0.05). After application of potential at 1.0 V for 5 min, the mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in MAGIC-5/HIV-1(NL43-Luc) cells were significantly increased compared with that of unstimulated MAGIC-5/HIV-1(NL43-Luc) cells (p < 0.01). However, the MFIs of hROS and NO in MAGIC-5 cells were also increased, to the same level, by electrical stimulation for 5 min. These results suggest that HIV-1 adsorbed onto or invading cells is damaged by direct or indirect effects of electrical stimulation, resulting in a decrease in HIV-1 infectivity. It is also suggested that hROS and NO induced by electrical stimulation are important factors for inhibiting HIV-1 infection."
