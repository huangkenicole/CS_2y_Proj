        "Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) are susceptible to chronic pulmonary infection due to certain Burkholderia species, but it is not clear whether this typically involves persistent infection with the same strain or sequential infection with distinct strains. We analyzed 1095 Burkholderia isolates recovered from serial sputum cultures from 379 patients with CF receiving care in 112 CF treatment centers in the United States. Genotyping was performed by random amplified polymorphic DNA typing or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Overall, a change in infecting strain was found in 24 (6.9%) of 347 patients infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex and in 3 (9%) of 32 patients infected with Burkholderia gladioli. Several patients were likely coinfected, at least transiently, with >1 B. cepacia complex strain. The potential for strain replacement during chronic infection may confound studies of the relationship between strain and clinical outcome and must be considered in designing effective infection-control practices."
