        "Soil-transmitted helminths cause widespread disease, infecting ~1.5 billion people living within poverty-stricken regions of tropical and subtropical countries. As adult worms inhabit the intestine alongside bacterial communities, we determined whether the bacterial microbiota impacted on host resistance against intestinal helminth infection. We infected germ-free, antibiotic-treated and specific pathogen-free mice, with the intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. Mice harboured increased parasite numbers in the absence of a bacterial microbiota, despite mounting a robust helminth-induced type 2 immune response. Alterations to parasite behaviour could already be observed at early time points following infection, including more proximal distribution of infective larvae along the intestinal tract and increased migration in a Baermann assay. Mice lacking a complex bacterial microbiota exhibited reduced levels of intestinal acetylcholine, a major excitatory intestinal neurotransmitter that promotes intestinal transit by activating muscarinic receptors. Both intestinal motility and host resistance against larval infection were restored by treatment with the muscarinic agonist bethanechol. These data provide evidence that a complex bacterial microbiota provides the host with resistance against intestinal helminths via its ability to regulate intestinal motility."
