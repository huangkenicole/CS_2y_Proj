        "An association between viral antigens, cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral titers in blood and lymphoid tissues suggests a direct CPE of Junin virus on the lymphopoietic organs of guinea pigs infected with 10(3) 50% lethal doses of the XJ prototype strain. After seven days of infection, all lymphoreticular organs had infectivity titers higher than those for blood. Virus was recovered from bone marrow and lymph nodes at day 5 after infection; peak titers were obtained from bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes after day 10. Granular specific fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of reticular monocytes after day 7; megakaryocytes showed positive fluorescence, but specific staining of other lymphoid cells was not observed. Necrosis of bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen was observed after day 9. CPE consisted of overdevelopment of reticuloendoplasmic cisterne of reticulomonocytes and myeloblasts. Typical Junin virus particles were observed. Reticular cells were gradually destroyed, and simultaneous necrosis of surrounding lymphoid cells was observed."
