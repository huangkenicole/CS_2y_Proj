      "AbstractText": [
        "Fourteen calves were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with the viral isolates as follows: 5 with 85/BH 16TV, 1 with 85/BH 17TV, 1 with 85/BH 18TV, 2 with 85/BH 231TN and 5 with 85/BH 232TN. Strain 85/BH 16TV was the only one which caused overt respiratory-like disease in all inoculated calves. Onset of the disease was observed after 7-8 days of incubation and was characterized by fever, depression, nasal discharge and coughing. Virus was isolated from the nasal swabbings of calves obtained from post-infection day (PID) 2-10. The other viral strains did not cause any sign of disease although virus was isolated regularly from the nasal swabbings of the inoculated calves. Virus was recovered from central nervous system tissues of calves that were infected with 85/BH 16TV or 85/BH 232TN strains and were killed on PID 4 or 8. Virus was also isolated from other tissues, such as lymph node, nasal mucosa (PID 8), or lung (PID 4). It was speculated that the nervous system could be one of the target areas of the virus of the naturally occurring infection by BHV-4. This might indicate a possible role of the nervous system (site of latency?) in the pathogenesis of BHV-4 as is the case in certain herpesviral infections of man and the lower animals."
