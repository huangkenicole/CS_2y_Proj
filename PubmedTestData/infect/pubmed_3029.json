        "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exists in different forms in the circulation of infected people: lipoprotein bound and lipoprotein free, enveloped and nonenveloped. Viral particles with the highest infectivity are associated with lipoproteins, whereas lipoprotein-free virions are poorly infectious. The detection of HCV's envelope proteins E1 and E2 in lipoprotein-associated virions has been challenging. Because lipoproteins are readily endocytosed, some forms of HCV might utilize their association with lipoproteins rather than E1 and E2 for cell attachment and internalization. However, vaccination of chimpanzees with recombinant envelope proteins protected the animals from hepatitis C infection, suggesting an important role for E1 and E2 in cell entry. It seems possible that different forms of HCV use different receptors to attach to and enter cells. The putative receptors and the assays used for their validation are discussed in this review."
