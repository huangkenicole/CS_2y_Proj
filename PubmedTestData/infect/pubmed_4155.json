        "Viral testing is not always recommended in children with bronchiolitis due to doubts concerning its prognostic use. In this retrospective study, we investigated how the RSV testing would influence the frequency of nosocomial infections (NI). The files of 305 children, hospitalized due to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the period 2010-2014, were reviewed in the study. We found ten cases of NI. The RSV preventive measures did not vary in the consecutive years investigated, but the number of viral tests substantially varied. In 2010, 2012, and 2014, when ca. 2 tests per RSV(+) patient were performed, the risk of NI per patient was 1.3%, while in 2011 and 2013, when the RSV testing was less frequent, the accumulated risk per patient was 5.2%. There was a strong adverse relationship between the number of tests performed and the number of NI (rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.975). The children with NI, when compared to those without NI, required a longer hospital stay, generating higher hospital costs regarding treatment, productivity loss, and indirect costs. The expenditure for RSV testing in the years of a low NI risk was higher than that in the high-risk years. Conversely, the expenditure related to NI management was lower in the years of a low NI risk. Each euro spent on RSV testing saved over 26 \u20ac from the NI management expenditure. We conclude that RSV testing is needed in the hospital setting to isolate the infected children and to prevent nosocomial RSV spread. This strategy is health advantageous and requires less resources than NI treatment."
