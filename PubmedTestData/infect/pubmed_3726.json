        "Deficiency in p53-mediated cell death is common in human cancer, contributing to both tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. In an attempt to restore p53, we evaluated in vitro infectivity and cytotoxicity of a wild type (w.t.) p53-expressing adenovirus (Ad-p53) toward a panel of human cancer cell lines (n = 19). At a multiplicity of infection of 30, both Ad-p53 and adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) infected greater than 99% of cells derived from brain, lung, breast, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancer, but failed to infect leukemia or lymphoma cells. Ad-p53, but not Ad-LacZ, infection of cancer cells was followed by nuclear accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p21WAFI/CIPI, cell cycle arrest and loss of viability. Ad-p53 induced apoptotic death in cancer cells that express mutant p53, including multi-drug resistant cells, but fewer deaths were observed in some w.t. p53 expressing cells. Ad-p53-infected SKBr3 breast cancer cells were more sensitive to cytotoxicity of the DNA damaging drugs mitomycin C or Adriamycin, but not the M-phase specific drug vincristine. Our results suggest that Ad-p53 is capable of infecting and killing cancer cells of diverse tissue origins (including multi-drug resistant cancer cells), that p21WAFI/CIPI may be a useful marker of p53 infectivity and that there may be synergy between Ad-p53 and either mitomycin C or Adriamycin induced cell death in tumors with p53 mutations."
