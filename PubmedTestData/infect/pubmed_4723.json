        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the previously identified B-cell epitope TSLNLQKDEPNGRASDTAGQ of the VapA protein of Rhodococcus equi and its association with R. equi pneumonia. A modified peptide designated PN11-14 corresponding to the epitope was recognized by all sera from experimentally infected foals with virulent R. equi ATCC103+ containing the virulence plasmid but not by its plasmid-cured derivative ATCC103- strain. Marked levels of VapA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G were detected in all sera from the ATCC103+ infected foals at 2 weeks after the infection. One control animal had high titres as determined by the peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indicating the ELISA may not absolutely differentiate between foals with R. equi pneumonia and healthy exposed foals in farms where the prevalence of disease is high. However, numbers of animals used were small. Further evaluation of the peptide ELISA with field samples is necessary to determine whether the assay is diagnostically useful. This study showed that levels of passive transfer of maternal IgG antibodies to the epitope in newborn foals could be measured. Interestingly, the maternally derived antibodies were found to significantly (P<0.05 by Student's t-test) decline 2 weeks after birth. Seroconversion against naturally occurring VapA expressing R. equi could be detected in some foals at 4 weeks of age. Antibodies to the epitope peaked and were significantly (P<0.05) greater in foals aged between 6 and 8 weeks. These results indicated that the peptide ELISA could be used to monitor anti-VapA antibodies in foals, particularly those at the age of 4-6 weeks. It is possible that the ELISA may be of some use as a diagnostic test on farms where R. equi is non-endemic. Further studies using large number of field samples are needed to verify this assumption."
