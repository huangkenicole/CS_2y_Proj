        "A yellow-pigmented Gram-negative bacterium, Chryseobacterium indologenes, was found in the gut contents of about 65% of soft ticks Ornithodoros moubata from a perishing laboratory colony. The isolated putative pathogen, C. indologenes, was susceptible to cotrimoxazol and addition of this antibiotic (Biseptol 480) to the blood meal significantly decreased the tick mortality rate. The artificial infection of healthy O. moubata by membrane feeding on blood contaminated with C. indologenes was lethal to all ticks at concentrations 10(6) bacteria/ml. On the contrary, a similar infection dose applied to the hard tick Ixodes ricinus by capillary feeding did not cause significant mortality. Examination of guts dissected from infected O. moubata and I. ricinus revealed that C. indologenes was exponentially multiplied in the soft tick but were completely cleared from the gut of the hard ticks within 1 day. In both tick species, C. indologenes were found to penetrate from the gut into the hemocoel. The phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both tick species was tested by intrahaemocoelic microinjection of C. indologenes and evaluated by indirect fluorescent microscopy using antibodies raised against whole bacteria. Hemocytes from both tick species displayed significant phagocytic activity against C. indologenes. All O. moubata injected with C. indologenes died within 3 days, whereas the increase of the mortality rate of I. ricinus was insignificant. Our results indicate that hard ticks possess much more efficient defense system against infection with C. indologenes than the soft ticks. Thus, C. indologenes infection has the potential to be a relevant comparative model for the study of tick immune reactions to transmitted pathogens."
