        "The child-care environment predisposes young children to infection with a variety of pathogens. Factors contributing to increased incidence of certain infections include age-specific hygiene behaviors, immunologic immaturity of young children, and exposure to pathogens with high infectivity. Respiratory tract and enteric pathogens are responsible for most illnesses, but a number of other agents are also important. Hygienic interventions, especially handwashing, remain important in infection control, but maintenance of appropriate immunization levels plays a crucial role in disease prevention in the child-care setting. Future interventions will center on development of new vaccines to eliminate susceptibility of young children to as many infectious agents as possible and continued evaluation of other preventive measures."
