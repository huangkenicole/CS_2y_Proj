        "Helicobacter pylori is involved in the pathogenesis of gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. The infection is prevalent in more than half of the world's population. Although the infection may lead to detrimental consequences, still the majority of the infected individuals only develop mild gastritis. Several factors are behind this paradoxical outcome including virulence of the infecting H. pylori strains, genetic background of the host, and factors related to lifestyle such as dietary habits. Among these, lifestyle including dietary factors was not in the limelight, until recently, as one of the important factors that could modulate H. pylori-linked gastric diseases. This review is directed to gather and elucidate the role of dietary components in augmenting or attenuating pathological processes initiated by H. pylori. Available evidence strongly supports the notion that the diet may play a critical role in defining the final outcome of H. pylori infection particularly if certain dietary components are taken on a regular basis for a long time. Despite a recent surge in research related to the role of dietary ingredients, further studies involving large-scale clinical trials are required to gain a better understanding of the precise role played by the dietary ingredients in H. pylori-associated pathogenesis."
