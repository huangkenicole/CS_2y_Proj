        "Effect of gamma radiation on oocysts of Eimeria necatrix was investigated. It was observed that oocysts exposed to 200 kR or above did not sporulate. Irratiation at 10-150 kR caused a progressive decrease in sporulation. Irradiation affected normal development of unsporulated oocysts as the zygote protoplasm divided into unequal masses or was shattered into granules. Increase in the intensity of irradiation of sporulated oocysts resulted in the progressive decrease in severity of the resultant infections in chicks and their effects - mortality, type of lesions developed, total oocyst production and immunity produced - were comparable with infections induced by decreasing the number of unirradiated oocysts. Infection produced by 1000 unirradiated oocysts was comparable with that resulting from 50 000 oocysts irradiated at 25 kR. Infection obtained with 20 000 unexposed oocysts approximated to that produced by 50 000 oocysts irradiated at 2-5 kR. It was concluded that irradiation abolished infectivity of the oocysts/sporozoites rather than bringing about attenuation of the parasite."
