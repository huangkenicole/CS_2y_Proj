        "There have been various reports concerning Helicobacter cinaedi infections. However, few reports have examined central nervous system infections.",
        "A 52-year-old man was transferred from the local hospital because of a persistent headache and suspected intracranial subdural empyema. Neurosurgical drainage was performed via burr holes. Gram staining and results from abscess cultures were negative. The blood culture yielded H. cinaedi. He was given an antibiotic regimen consisting of 2\u00a0g of ceftriaxone twice a day, but the size of the abscess was not reduced in size at all after 3\u00a0weeks of treatment. Neurosurgical drainage was performed again, and the antimicrobial regimen was switched to 2\u00a0g of meropenem 3 times a day. The size of the abscess was reduced after 2\u00a0weeks of the second drainage and antimicrobial drug change to meropenem. After 4\u00a0weeks treatment with meropenem, the patient was discharged, and his symptoms had completely resolved.",
        "H. cinaedi infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subdural empyema cases for which Gram staining and abscess culture results are negative. Meropenem can be a first-line drug of choice or an effective alternative treatment for H. cinaedi central nervous system infections."
