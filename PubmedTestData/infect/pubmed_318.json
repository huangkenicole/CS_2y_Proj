        "Pasteurella multocida was isolated from 2 farms on which grower or finisher pigs had problems of severe emaciation and high death loss (greater than 5%). At necropsy, the pigs had extensive suppurative pleuritis and pericarditis, with adhesions over the lung surface. On one farm, the pigs also had multiple lung abscesses. Histologic findings included polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in bronchial and alveolar spaces, thickening of alveolar walls, pleuritis, and in some cases, abscesses. From all pigs, P multocida was isolated. The strains (A52, A59) were serotype A and were nontoxigenic. Experimental reproduction of the disease was achieved by sequentially infecting conventionally weaned pigs intranasally with pseudorabies virus; 7 days later, infection with selected P multocida laboratory strains (A50 and D82, A52 and A59) was achieved. At necropsy, pigs inoculated with strains A59 and A52 (serotype A, pleurotropic) had more severe lesions (P less than 0.05) than those inoculated with strain A50 (serotype A, pneumotropic). Also, pigs infected with strains A59 and A52 had extensive pleuritis and abscessation, which were not observed in the other groups. Strain D82 (serotype D) was not capable of producing pneumonia or pleuritis. Pleuritis and abscessation may be associated with certain P multocida strains that are serotype A, but not with others. These pleurotropic strains seem to be more virulent than pneumotropic strains, and infection with the former may result in extensive pleuritis and abscess formation."
