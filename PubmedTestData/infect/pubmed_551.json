        "In this paper we present the results of studies on the infectivity of an isolate of avian pneumovirus (APV) from turkeys to broiler chickens. Two-week-old broiler chicks free of antibodies to APV were exposed either by oculonasal or oral route with a cell cultured APV of turkey origin. Chickens from both APV-inoculated groups exhibited clinical signs that included coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and watery eyes during 2-8 days postinoculation. Tissue samples from birds in the APV-inoculated group were positive for APV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) up to 9 days postinoculation. Samples of blood from both oculonasally and orally infected chickens were positive for APV. Intestinal samples from chickens infected with APV orally were positive for the presence of APV on PCR up to 9 days postinoculation. APV was reisolated from samples taken from chickens in both groups inoculated orally and oculonasally. Sera from birds exposed by the oculonasal or by the oral route showed the presence of APV-specific antibodies."
