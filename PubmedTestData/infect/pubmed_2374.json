        "This review aims to identify and highlight important data published in the past 12 months which provide new information on nontyphoidal salmonellosis in Africa.",
        "Recent reviews and clinical studies continue to emphasize the challenges of diagnosis and management of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonellae (NTS) disease as a major cause of mortality in African children and HIV-infected African adults. New observational evidence of the association between malaria and NTS disease in African children has been published. An improved understanding of disease pathogenesis has been provided with evidence of persistent intracellular infection in HIV-infected adults. Multidrug resistance of NTS is now widespread in the region. A novel variant of NTS has emerged which is now a common cause of invasive disease in African populations, and it shows evidence of adaptation to human host and has acquired virulence plasmids along with multidrug resistance. Recent studies have provided original data of the importance of humoral immunity in African children, which informs the development of vaccine.",
        "NTS are a major cause of invasive disease in Africa. Recent studies provide a range of helpful insights and novel data which could inform strategies for improving management and especially prevention of this neglected disease."
