        "Some bacterial pathogens can manipulate the angiogenic response, suppressing or inducing it for their own ends. In humans, Bartonella henselae is associated with cat-scratch disease and vasculoproliferative disorders such as bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis. Although endothelial cells (ECs) support the pathogenesis of <i>B. henselae</i>, the mechanisms by which <i>B. henselae</i> induces EC activation are not completely clear, as well as the possible contributions of other cells recruited at the site of infection. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are endowed with angiogenic potential and play a dual role in infections, exerting antimicrobial properties but also acting as a shelter for pathogens. Here, we delved into the role of MSCs as a reservoir of <i>B. henselae</i> and modulator of EC functions. B. henselae readily infected MSCs and survived in perinuclearly bound vacuoles for up to 8\u2009days. Infection enhanced MSC proliferation and the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1), proteins that are involved in bacterial internalization and cytokine production. Secretome analysis revealed that infected MSCs secreted higher levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), placental growth factor (PIGF), serpin E1, thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D), chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8). Supernatants from B. henselae-infected MSCs increased the susceptibility of ECs to B. henselae infection and enhanced EC proliferation, invasion, and reorganization in tube-like structures. Altogether, these results indicate MSCs as a still underestimated niche for persistent B. henselae infection and reveal MSC-EC cross talk that may contribute to exacerbate bacterium-induced angiogenesis and granuloma formation."
