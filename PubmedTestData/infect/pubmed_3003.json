        "Several mutant genes in HIV co-receptors (e.g., CCR5, CCR2 and CXCR4) have been correlated with susceptibility to HIV or/and rate of progression to AIDS. Some of these genes have high allele frequencies in general populations. Their effects on the HIV/AIDS dynamics may be significant. To study such genetic heterogeneity, Hsu Schmitz [S.-F. Hsu Schmitz, A mathematical model of HIV transmission in homosexuals with genetic heterogeneity, J. Theoret. Med. (to appear)] proposed a one-sex model with susceptibles classified by genotype as having no, partial or full natural resistance to HIV infection and infecteds classified as rapid, normal or slow progressors. The example of CCR5-Delta32 mutation in San Francisco gay men indicated that the normal progressors are most responsible for disease spread. The per-partnership transmission rates of rapid and slow progressors are identified as key parameters. The present manuscript extends the previous one by considering the intervention of treatment or/and vaccination. Detailed investigations are illustrated by using the same example of CCR5-Delta32 mutation in San Francisco gay men. Treating only newly infected individuals or vaccinating only newly recruited susceptibles is not effective enough for disease control. When both measures are applied, the epidemic may be eradicated if the transmission rate of slow progressors is not too large, and treatments and vaccines in use are of decent quality."
