        "The present work is based on the direct relationship, revealed in our investigations, between the hyaluronidase activity of meningococcal strains and their capacity to penetrate into the blood and the liquor. The use of the intranasal route (i.e. the natural route) for infecting previously untreated mice with meningococci in the presence of hyaluronidase made it possible to follow the generalized form of meningococcal infection in all its stages from the period of incubation and microbial invasion to bacteriemia, accompanied by the penetration of the infective agent into the meninges, and toxinemia. This route of infection ensured the penetration of the infective agent, but the natural specific resistance of mice to meningococci prevented their multiplication with the subsequent liberation of a sufficient amount of endotoxin killing the animals. To overcome natural immunity and increase toxicity, actinomycin D was injected intraperitoneally in a volume of 0.5 ml (5 gamma) simultaneously with the administration of the microbial culture and hyaluronidase, thus ensuring 40-60% mortality among the animals. Our model of the generalized form of meningococcal infection can be used in the study of pathogenesis and for the development of the methods of treatment and microbiological diagnosis."
