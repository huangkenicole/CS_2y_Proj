        "<i>Coxiella burnetii</i> is an intracellular, zoonotic pathogen that is the causative agent of Q fever. Infection most frequently occurs after inhalation of contaminated aerosols, which can lead to acute, self-limiting febrile illness or more serve chronic infections such as hepatitis or endocarditis. Macrophages are the principal target cells during infection where <i>C. burnetii</i> resides and replicates within a unique phagolysosome-like compartment, the <i>Coxiella</i>-containing vacuole (CCV). The first virulence determinant described as necessary for infection was full-length lipopolysaccarride (LPS); spontaneous rough mutants (phase II) arise after passage in immuno-incompetent hosts. Phase II <i>C. burnetii</i> are attenuated in immuno-competent animals, but are fully capable of infecting a variety of host cells <i>in vitro</i>. A clonal strain of the Nine Mile isolate (RSA439, clone 4), has a 26 KDa chromosomal deletion that includes LPS biosynthetic genes and is uniquely approved for use in BL2/ABL2 conditions. With the advances of axenic media and genetic tools for <i>C. burnetii</i> research, the characterization of novel virulence determinants is ongoing and almost exclusively performed using this attenuated clone. A major problem with predicting essential virulence loci with RSA439 is that, although some cell-autonomous phenotypes can be assessed in tissue culture, no animal model for assessing pathogenesis has been defined. Here we describe the use of SCID mice for predicting virulence factors of <i>C. burnetii</i>, in either independent or competitive infections. We propose that this model allows for the identification of mutations that are competent for intracellular replication <i>in vitro</i>, but attenuated for growth <i>in vivo</i> and predict essential innate immune responses modulated by the pathogen during infection as a central pathogenic strategy."
