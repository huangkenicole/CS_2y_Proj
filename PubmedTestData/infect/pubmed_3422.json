        "Bacterial infections in myocardium may lead to the myocardial damage, which may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to cause myocarditis and other systemic infections especially in immunocompromised patients. To understand the cellular responses during the establishment of infection in myocardium, we challenged differentiated H9C2 cells with P. aeruginosa PAO1. We also did comparison studies with infected undifferentiated form of H9C2 cells. Invasion studies revealed that PAO1 can invade both forms of cells and is able to survive and replicate within the host. Internalization of PAO1 was confirmed by live cell imaging and flow cytometry analysis. Though invasion of the pathogen triggered an increased ROS production in the host cells at earlier post-infection periods, it was decreased at later post-infection periods. Invasion of PAO1 induced cell death through apoptosis in differentiated H9C2 cells. Significant decrease in cell size, formation of polarized mitochondria, and nuclear fragmentation were observed in the infected differentiated cells. On the contrary, cell death preceded by multinucleation was observed in infected undifferentiated H9C2 cells. Morphological markers such as multinuclei and micro nuclei were observed. Cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase corroborates that the undifferentiated H9C2 cells experienced cell death preceded by multinucleation."
