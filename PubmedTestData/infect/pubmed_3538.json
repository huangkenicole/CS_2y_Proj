        "The genus Megalocytivirus is known to infect a wide range of cultured marine fish. In this study, we examined the pathogenicity of FLIV (Megalocytivirus from olive flounder, genotype III) and RBIV (Megalocytivirus from rock bream, genotype I) to their homologous and heterologous host species. Olive flounder (7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0cm) injected with FLIV [major capsid protein (MCP) gene copies, 6.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup> -6.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> /fish] at 24\u00a0\u00b0C did not die until 90\u00a0days post-infection (dpi). The average virus replication in the spleen peaked (1.27\u00a0\u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> /fish) at 20\u00a0dpi. Rock bream (6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0cm) injected with FLIV (8.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> and 6.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> /fish of MCP copies) showed no mortality until 50\u00a0dpi. The rock bream that survived after FLIV infection were rechallenged with RBIV at 50\u00a0dpi had 100% mortality, showing that there is no cross-protection between FLIV and RBIV. Temperature shifting (26\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0\u00b0C at 12\u00a0h intervals) did not cause FLIV-specific mortality into olive flounder, but higher virus copies were observed in the fish exposed to higher stocking density. This study demonstrates that FLIV and RBIV have different antigenic and pathogenic characteristics and that FLIV has low pathogenicity to olive flounder."
