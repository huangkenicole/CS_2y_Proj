        "A study was conducted to determine the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in wild mice (Mus musculus) and the infectivity of oocysts from their feces for susceptible calves. The presence of oocysts and the duration of shedding of oocysts in the feces were evaluated in 115 wild mice. Approximately 30% of the mice shed Cryptosporidium sp oocysts, without evidence of clinical infection; recurrence of oocyst shedding was found in about 50% of the mice. Oocysts from the feces of naturally infected mice were infective for calves and mice. Calves began shedding oocysts at 7 days and shed oocysts for about 10 days. Nonfatal, clinical cryptosporidiosis developed in 7 infected calves. The mice began shedding oocysts at 6 days and shed oocysts for 12 days. Fatalities or clinical infection did not develop in 5 infected mice. The results indicated that Cryptosporidium-infected wild mice may be a source of cryptosporidiosis in susceptible calves."
