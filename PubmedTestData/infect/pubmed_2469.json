        "Neutrophils and eosinophils, isolated from the blood of mice infected with Nematospiroides dubius, were tested for their capacity to damage exsheathed third stage N. dubius larvae in vitro. In the presence of fresh serum from infected mice, both types of granulocyte caused a significant reduction in larval infectivity (up to 40-50%) whereas lymphocytes/monocytes prepared from the same blood samples were inactive. Neutrophils were at least as active as eosinophils, on a cell for cell basis. None of the cells exhibited larvicidal activity in the absence of serum and serum alone had no effect. The reduction in larval infectivity caused by neutrophils in the presence of fresh normal mouse serum (NMS) was only marginally less than that obtained using immune mouse serum (IMS), suggesting that complement, which is activated by the larvae via the alternative pathway and mediates the adherence of both cell types, was able to promote the larvicidal effect of these cells in vitro. In contrast to neutrophils, eosinophils were considerably less effective in NMS than in IMS. Both NMS and IMS were ineffective if they had been heat-inactivated or incubated with methylamine at pH 8.0 to destroy complement activity. The immunoglobulin fraction of IMS was also ineffective in promoting neutrophil or eosinophil-mediated larval damage. These results indicate that in this in vitro system antibodies are incapable of directing the activity of either cell type in the absence of complement. A novel finding of this study was that neutrophils from uninfected mice were unable to reduce larval infectivity in the presence of fresh NMS or IMS. 'Altered' neutrophils possessing larvicidal activity appeared in the blood of mice within 4 days of infection with N. dubius."
