        "Bacterial endophthalmitis is a potentially blinding intraocular infection. The bacterium Bacillus cereus causes a devastating form of this disease which progresses rapidly, resulting in significant inflammation and loss of vision within a few days. The outer surface of B.\u00a0cereus incites the intraocular inflammatory response, likely through interactions with innate immune receptors such as TLRs. This study analyzed the role of B.\u00a0cereus pili, adhesion appendages located on the bacterial surface, in experimental endophthalmitis. To test the hypothesis that the presence of pili contributed to intraocular inflammation and virulence, we analyzed the progress of experimental endophthalmitis in mouse eyes infected with wild type B.\u00a0cereus (ATCC 14579) or its isogenic pilus-deficient mutant (\u0394bcpA-srtD-bcpB or \u0394Pil). One hundred CFU were injected into the mid-vitreous of one eye of each mouse. Infections were analyzed by quantifying intraocular bacilli and retinal function loss, and by histology from 0 to 12\u00a0h postinfection. In\u00a0vitro growth and hemolytic phenotypes of the infecting strains were also compared. There was no difference in hemolytic activity (1:8 titer), motility, or in\u00a0vitro growth (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05, every 2\u00a0h, 0-18\u00a0h) between wild type B.\u00a0cereus and the \u0394Pil mutant. However, infected eyes contained greater numbers of wild type B.\u00a0cereus than \u0394Pil during the infection course (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, 3-12\u00a0h). Eyes infected with wild type B.\u00a0cereus experienced greater losses in retinal function than eyes infected with the \u0394Pil mutant, but the differences were not always significant. Eyes infected with \u0394Pil or wild type B.\u00a0cereus achieved similar degrees of severe inflammation. The results indicated that the intraocular growth of pilus-deficient B.\u00a0cereus may have been better controlled, leading to a trend of greater retinal function in eyes infected with the pilus-deficient strain. Although this difference was not enough to significantly alter the severity of the inflammatory response, these results suggest a potential role for pili in protecting B.\u00a0cereus from clearance during the early stages of endophthalmitis, which is a newly described virulence mechanism for this organism and this infection."
