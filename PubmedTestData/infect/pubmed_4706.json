        "Infections with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype III and Y. enterocolitica serotype O2,3 were found to be common in Australian sheep flocks. Transmission of Y. pseudotuberculosis occurred in late winter and early spring, while Y. enterocolitica transmission occurred from midwinter to early summer. Excretion of Y. pseudotuberculosis was limited to the winter and spring period and was particularly common in 1- and 2-year-old sheep. Infection persisted for up to 14 weeks. Y. pseudotuberculosis infection did not confer immunity to natural infection with Y. enterocolitica. Y. enterocolitica excretion occurred year-round, with the greatest prevalence being in summer and autumn. Infection persisted for up to 29 weeks. Sheep less than 1 year old were most commonly infected with Y. enterocolitica. Infection with either Y. pseudotuberculosis or Y. enterocolitica was rare in aged sheep. Restriction endonuclease analysis of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III from sheep, cattle, deer, and pigs showed that the bacterial isolates were genetically indistinguishable. Similarly, Y. enterocolitica isolates from sheep were indistinguishable from those isolated from goats and cattle."
