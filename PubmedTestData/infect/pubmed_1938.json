        "The infectivity and reproductive potential of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Oswego strain), at different concentrations, was studied. Seventy to 80.0% mortality to late instar larvae of the clover root curculio, Sitona hispidulus, and 40.0-76.0% mortality to pupae, was observed at concentrations of 15-100 infective juveniles. There were no significant differences in mortality among nematode concentrations. LC(50) levels of 4.0 and 21.4 nematodes were determined for clover root curculio larvae and pupae, respectively. Nematodes did not cause significant mortality to adult or first instar clover root curculio. H. bacteriophora was able to complete its development and reproduce in 74.0-95.0% of clover root curculio late instar larvae and pupae. Reproductive potential in curculio larvae and pupae ranged from 0 to 7040 infective juveniles per host. Larvae exposed to 100 nematodes had a reproductive potential significantly higher than in those larvae exposed to 15 and 50 nematodes. Reproductive potential in pupae decreased with an increased nematode dose, indicating potential crowding effects. Host larval and pupal mass were positively correlated with nematode progeny production."
