        "To investigate the possibility of Hantavirus (HV) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot) coinfection in their hosts.",
        "HV and Ot were used to infect Vero E6 cells cultured in vitro singly, simultaneously or successively. Genes of HV and Ot were identified in different generation cells with RT-PCR.",
        "Five experiment groups of infected Vero E6 cells were tested, the results were as follows: HV and Ot were both positive in infected Vero E6 cells passaged 2 times and the positive rate increased following the passaged times in HV and Ot infection groups, simultaneously or successively. However, in the groups which were infected with HV and Ot separately, the gene of HV or Ot could be detected in infected Vero E6 cells passaged only once and the positive rate increased following the times of the passaged. The positive rate was higher in the singly infected groups than in those infected simultaneously or successively.",
        "Coinfection of HV and Ot did exist in the hosts while HV and Ot could inhibit each other in the initial infection stage."
