      "AbstractText": [
        "Mycobacterium canettii forms part of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Mycobacterium canettii infections are mainly described in the Horn of Africa. The permanent presence of French soldiers in Djibouti raises the question of the risk of being infected with M. canettii. Here, we describe M. canettii infections among French military and their families between 1998 and 2015.",
        "This retrospective study relied on 3 sources of data: the reference center for mycobacteria in the Biology Department at Percy Military Hospital in Paris, the French Military Center for Epidemiology and Public Health, and the scientific literature. After an exhaustive census of the strains, we studied the epidemiological data on 20 cases among French soldiers and their families.",
        "Twenty cases of M. canettii infections are reported, including 5 unpublished cases. Adenitis predominates (n = 15), especially in the cervico facial area and among children; 1 case was observed 1 month after dental care in Djibouti. The pulmonary forms were less frequent (n = 6), and 3 atypical forms are described. All patients had stayed in Djibouti.",
        "Cases of M. canettii infection among the French military consisted mainly of adenitis; disseminated forms were possible with immunodeficiency. Their evolution under specific treatments was comparable to that of tuberculosis. The presumed origin of the infection seemed to be environmental, possibly a water reservoir, and not due to human-to-human contagion."
