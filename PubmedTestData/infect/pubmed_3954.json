      "AbstractText": [
        "HIV infects several cell types in the body, including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages. Here we review the role of macrophages in HIV infection and describe complex interactions between viral proteins and host defenses in these cells. Macrophages exist in many forms throughout the body, where they play numerous roles in healthy and diseased states. They express pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens, making them both a key player in innate immunity and a potential target of infection by pathogens, including HIV. Among these PRRs is mannose receptor, a macrophage-specific protein that binds oligosaccharides, restricts HIV replication, and is downregulated by the HIV accessory protein Vpr. Vpr significantly enhances infection in vivo, but the mechanism by which this occurs is controversial. It is well established that Vpr alters the expression of numerous host proteins by using its co-factor DCAF1, a component of the DCAF1-DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. The host proteins targeted by Vpr and their role in viral replication are described in detail. We also discuss the structure and function of the viral protein Env, which is stabilized by Vpr in macrophages. Overall, this literature review provides an updated understanding of the contributions of macrophages and Vpr to HIV pathogenesis."
