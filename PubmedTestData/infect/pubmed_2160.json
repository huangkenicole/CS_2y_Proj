        "The occurrence of urinary tract infection and its clinical impact is determined, as with any infectious disease, by the interaction between the virulence of the infecting organism and the host defense mechanisms that can be mobilized. In the case of urinary tract infections, an anatomically and functionally intact kidney and urinary tract are the primary host defenses, with phagocytic function and immune mechanisms coming into play to limit the consequences of those infections. Of all the categories of immunocompromised hosts, the renal transplant patient is the one most susceptible to the direct and indirect consequences of urinary tract infections. In the first 3 months post transplant, the incidence of urinary tract infection is greater than 30%, and there is a relatively high rate of bacteremia and overt pyelonephritis of the allograft. After this time period, unless anatomic or functional derangement of the urinary tract is present, the direct clinical manifestations are far more benign. In addition to the direct effects of urinary tract infection on these patients, indirect effects are also important. These include the activation of CMV by TNF released as a consequence of a urinary tract infection and the initiation of allograft injury. Fortunately, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones are safe and effective prophylactic strategies for preventing the direct and indirect consequences of urinary tract infections. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are incompletely understood, data are emerging that AIDS patients have both an increased incidence and severity of urinary tract infection. The risk for urinary tract infections seem to be correlated with the degree of immune compromise and, perhaps, the amount of malnutrition and wasting that are present. The best strategies for preventing urosepsis in AIDS patients remain to be defined."
