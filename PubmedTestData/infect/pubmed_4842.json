      "AbstractText": [
        "We recently reported that a chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVKU-1) developed in our laboratory caused progressive depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and AIDS within 6 months of inoculation into pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina). None of the pig-tailed macaques showed productive SHIV infection in the central nervous system (CNS). In this report, we show that by further passage of the pathogenic virus in rhesus macaques [M. mulatta], we have derived a new strain of SHIV (SHIVKU-2) that has caused AIDS and productive CNS infection in 3 of 5 rhesus macaques infected with the virus. Productive replication of SHIV in the CNS was clearly shown by high infectivity titers and p27 protein levels in brain homogenates, and in 2 of the 3 rhesus macaques this was associated with disseminated, nodular, demyelinating lesions, including focal multinucleated giant cell reaction, largely confined to the white matter. These findings were reminiscent of HIV-1 associated neurological disease, and our immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization data indicated that the neuropathological lesions were associated with the presence of SHIV-specific viral antigens and nucleic acid respectively. However, the concomitant reactivation of opportunistic infections in these macaques suggested that such pathogens may have influenced the replication of SHIV in the CNS, or modified the neuropathological sequelae of SHIV infection in the rhesus species, but not in pig-tailed macaques. Our findings in the two species of macaques highlight the complexities of lentiviral neuropathogenesis, the precise mechanisms of which are still elusive."
