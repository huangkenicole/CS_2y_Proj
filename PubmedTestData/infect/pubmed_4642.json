        "The characteristics of four United Kingdom isolates of swine vesicular disease (SVD) virus from 1981 to 1982 have been compared with those of an isolate obtained from the first outbreak of swine vesicular disease diagnosed in the United Kingdom in 1972. When the virus structural proteins were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the four isolates from 1981-82 all had the same polypeptide pattern, which was different from that of the 1972 isolate. Immunodiffusion tests with the 1972 isolate and one 1982 isolate did not reveal any antigenic difference between the viruses but minor antigenic differences were shown by cross-neutralisation tests between the 1972 isolate and the four isolates from 1981-82. In experimentally infected pigs the 1972 isolate produced typical SVD lesions whereas the four more recent SVD viruses produced only very mild clinical disease. Clinical lesions scored numerically were four- to 10- and five- to 11-fold higher at seven and 14 days after infection for pigs infected with the 1972 isolate than with the four isolates from 1981-82. The serum of pigs infected with the 1972 isolate contained significantly higher levels of neutralising antibody than those of pigs infected with more recent isolates. The antibody titres of pigs with only primary lesions ranged from log10 1.9 to 2.8 and one clinically normal pig had a titre of log10 2.4 at 14 days after infection. Attention is drawn to the implication of these findings for SVD control policies based only on the recognition and reporting of clinical disease."
