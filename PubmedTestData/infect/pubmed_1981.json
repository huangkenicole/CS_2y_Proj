        "Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) associated with a group A beta hemolytic streptococcal infection was described 18 y ago. Since then, although the pathophysiology of the syndrome has been clarified, mortality can be as high as 80%. A middle-aged female developed STSS associated with a group A streptococcal pneumonia. Laboratory studies confirmed respiratory and renal failure as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation with a striking reduction in endogenous procoagulants. The patient, probably due to her HLA DRB1*14 haplotype was unable to generate anti-streptococcal antibodies. She was treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy together with intravenous gamma globulin and drotrecogin or activated protein C. Her response to this combined therapy was accompanied by a rapid resolution of the multiorgan failure and correction of the accompanying disseminated intravascular coagulation. This rapid response to treatment supports the hypohesis that several host factors including the immune response and loss of procoagulants determine the development and severity of the toxic shock syndromes. Further studies with this combined approach appear warranted."
