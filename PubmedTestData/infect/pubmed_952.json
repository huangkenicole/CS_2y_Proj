        "Duck circovirus (DuCV) is one of the most prevalent infectious viruses in the duck industry in China. Although the clinical symptoms vary, it often causes immunosuppression in the host and leads to secondary infection with other pathogens. Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) mainly infects chickens and causes hydropericardium hepatitis syndrome. However, the incidence of infection in ducks has increased in recent years, and the phenomenon of mixed infection with DuCV is very common, resulting in more severe clinical morbidity. However, there is no systematic study evaluating the presence of mixed infection. To explore the synergistic pathogenicity of DuCV and FAdV-4 co-infection in Cherry Valley ducks, a comparative experiment was established between DuCV and FAdV-4 co-infection and single infection animal models. It was found that DuCV and FAdV-4 co-infected ducks showed more pronounced clinical signs of pericardial effusion, hepatitis and immunosuppression; more severe tissue damage in target organs; and more significant levels of viral load, biochemical indicators and immune indicators in various organs compared with Cherry Valley ducks infected with just one virus. The results showed that co-infection with DuCV and FAdV-4 may promote greater viral replication, causing more severe tissue damage and immunosuppression than infection with just one virus. Therefore, the monitoring and prevention of the two viruses should be strengthened clinically, with a particular focus on the potential harm of DuCV as it carries the highest infection rate."
