      "AbstractText": [
        "The endemic human coronavirus NL63 strain (HCoV-NL63) employs angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on cell surfaces to infect hosts in the same manner as SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2. It has been proposed that patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a higher mortality rate due to over-expression of ACE-2 receptors.",
        "We sought to evaluate the impact of ACE-I/ARB on infectivity of various endemic coronavirus strains, hypothesizing that rates of ACE-I use among patients with HCoV-NL63 would be higher compared to other endemic coronavirus strains that do not utilize the ACE-2 receptor.",
        "A retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate a total 466 subjects with a positive respiratory pathogens panel for one of the endemic coronavirus strains. Rate of ACE-I/ARB use among each coronavirus strain and clinical outcomes from the 88 HCoV-NL63 positive subjects was collected.",
        "Analysis revealed a higher rate of ACE-I (p=0.006) use among the HCoV-NL63 positives compared to the other three endemic coronavirus strains. The rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.007) and 90-day mortality (p=0.045) among HCoV-NL63 positives on ACE-I therapy was higher compared to those HCoV-NL63 positives not on ACE-I therapy.",
        "Concurrent therapy with an ACE-I was associated with an increased rate and severity of infection with the HCoV-NL63. This association was not found in infected patients on concurrent ARB therapy. These findings support the importance of further evaluation in patients on these therapies who are infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2."
