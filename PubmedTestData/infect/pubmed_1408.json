        "Since the early 1900s, Bartonella species were known only to cause human disease resulting from very restricted geographic (bartonellosis) or environmental influences (\"trench fever\"). In the 1990s, and in parallel, cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis were definitively linked to Bartonella species. Subsequently, widespread use of modern diagnostic methods revealed the broad ecologic niche of this organism and greatly expanded our knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical presentations associated with this genus. A large number of reservoirs and vectors involved with Bartonella propagation and transmission to humans have been identified; cats and various arthropods remain the most well-studied to date. Though not completely understood, it appears that specific immune-modulated interactions between the infecting species and host-related factors play a major role in the observed breadth of human clinical syndromes associated with Bartonellae, the large differences in immunopathologic features of tissue samples among different syndromes and potentially the varied responses to antimicrobial therapy. Further, the clinical management for cat scratch disease in particular is quite variable among clinicians, reflecting a poor evidence base. No preventive measures have been developed beyond suggestions to avoid at-risk behavior with known vectors."
