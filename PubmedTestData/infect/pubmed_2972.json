        "The consequences of inoculation of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 11 into 16 susceptible cows either at the time of breeding or at specified stages of pregnancy were studied. The cows were free of BTV or epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and none had antibodies to BTV before virus inoculation. A group of 4 cows was mated naturally to a bull reported to shed BTV-11 (CO75B300 strain) in the semen. The bull was suspected of infecting cows at mating with BTV-11, which subsequently transplacentally infected the developing fetuses and induced persistently infected and congenitally malformed progeny. Two groups of 4 pregnant cows were inoculated with an insect-derived strain of BTV-11 (CO75B300), one group by direct deposit into the uterus at estrus, the other, by intradermal and SC administrations. A 90-day fetus was inoculated in utero with virus from the same pool. Four pregnant cows were inoculated with sheep blood-passaged virus of the same BTV-11 strain (CO75B300) by intradermal and SC routes. Three cows were inoculated with BTV-free suspending fluids and ovine erythrocytes by the intrauterine and intradermal-SC routes and were used as in-contact controls. Infection with insect-derived BTV-11 was confirmed in 3 cows of 1 group by virus isolation and by detection of serum antibodies. The 4 cows inoculated with sheep blood suspension of BTV-11 developed viremia and produced antibodies to the virus. None of the cattle had clinical signs of bluetongue, other than 2 cows that had a slight rectal temperature increase on postinoculation day 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
