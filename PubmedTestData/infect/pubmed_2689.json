        "Co-infection of rainbow trout with infections haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and Flavobacterium psychrophilum is known to occur, and it has been speculated that a combined infection can result in dramatic losses. Both pathogens can persist in fish in an asymptomatic carrier state, but the impact of co-infection has not been well characterized or documented. In this study, it was hypothesized that fish co-infected with F.\u00a0psychrophilum and IHNV would exhibit greater mortality than fish infected with either pathogen alone. To test this, juvenile rainbow trout were co-infected with low doses of either IHNV or F.\u00a0psychrophilum, and at 2\u00a0days post-initial challenge, they were given a low dose of the reciprocal pathogen. This combined infection caused high mortality (76.2%-100%), while mortality from a single pathogen infection with the same respective dose was low (5%-20%). The onset of mortality was earlier in the co-infected group (3-4\u00a0days) when compared with fish infected with F.\u00a0psychrophilum alone (6\u00a0days) or IHNV (5\u00a0days), confirming the synergistic interaction between both pathogens. Co-infection led to a significant increase in the number of F.\u00a0psychrophilum colony-forming units and IHNV plaque-forming units within tissues. This finding confirms that when present together in co-infected fish, both pathogens are more efficiently recovered from tissues. Furthermore, pathogen genes were significantly increased in co-infected groups, which parallel the findings of increased systemic pathogen load. Extensive tissue necrosis and abundant pathogen present intracellularly and extracellularly in haematopoietic tissue. This was pronounced in co-infected fish and likely contributed to the exacerbated clinical signs and higher mortality. This study provides novel insight into host-pathogen interactions related to co-infection by aquatic bacterial and viral pathogens and supports our hypothesis. Such findings confirm that mortality in fish exposed to both pathogens is greatly elevated compared to a single pathogen infection."
