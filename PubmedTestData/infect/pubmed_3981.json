        "Despite increased awareness of infection control precautions, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) still spreads through patients and contaminated objects, causing a substantial burden of illness and cost. Our objective was to define risk factors for contracting MRSA in a tertiary health care facility using a historic case-control study and to validate health care network changes during pre-outbreak and outbreak periods.",
        "We conducted a case-control study using secondary data on hospitalizations where infected or colonized cases were compared with matched controls who tested negative by age, sex, and campus over 1 year. Social networks of all cases and controls were built from links joining patients to rooms, roommates, and health care providers over time.",
        "Matched controls were similar to cases in comorbidity, lengths of stay, mortality, and number of roommates, rooms, and health care providers. As expected, the number of rooms and roommates increased in the outbreak by more than 50%. A timed animation of the network at one campus identified potential source patients linked to 2 rooms and many roommates, after which cases connected to those same rooms proliferated.",
        "Only the network animation over time revealed possible transmission of MRSA through the network, rather than attributes measured in the traditional case control study."
