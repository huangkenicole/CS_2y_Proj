        "Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and Akabane virus (AKAV) are teratogenic Simbu serogroup Orthobunyaviruses. Embryonated chicken egg models (ECE) have been used to study the pathogenicity and teratogenicity of Simbu viruses previously, however to date no such studies have been reported for SBV. Hence, the aims of this study were to investigate if ECE are susceptible to experimental SBV infection, and to evaluate the pathogenicity and teratogenicity of SBV and AKAV in ECE models. Two studies were conducted. In Study A, SBV (10<sup>6.4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) was inoculated into the yolk-sac of 6-day-old and 8-day-old ECEs. In Study B, SBV and AKAV were inoculated into 7-day-old ECEs at a range of doses (10<sup>2.0</sup>-10<sup>6.0</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>). ECE were incubated at 37\u202f\u00b0C until day 19, when they were submitted for pathological and virological examination. SBV infection in ECE at 6, 7 and 8\u202fdays of incubation resulted in stunted growth and musculoskeletal malformations (arthrogryposis, skeletal muscle atrophy, contracted toes, distorted and twisted legs). Mortality was greater in embryos inoculated with SBV (31%) compared to AKAV (19%), (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), suggesting that SBV was more embryo-lethal. However, embryos infected with AKAV had a significantly higher prevalence of stunted growth (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) and musculoskeletal malformations (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), suggesting that AKAV was more teratogenic in this model. These studies demonstrate for the first time that the ECE model is a suitable in vivo small animal model to study SBV. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the clinico-pathological findings of natural SBV and AKAV infection in ruminants."
