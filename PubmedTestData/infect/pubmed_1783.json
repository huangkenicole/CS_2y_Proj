        "Pathogenicity of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi for laboratory mice is known to be influenced by at least three factors: (i) route of inoculation, (ii) antigenic strain, and (iii) natural resistance of the host. By using Karp, Gilliam, and Kato strains of R. tsutsugamushi, we examined the effect of these three pathogenicity factors on the kinetics of infection and the development of immunity in BALB/cDub and C3H/HeDub mice. The appearance of rickettsemia in the pathogenic infections generally preceded infections of reduced pathogenicity by 1 to 2 days in both magnitude and time of onset. Mice infected by the subcutaneous route with normally pathogenic rickettsiae, i.e., Gilliam-infected C3H/HeDub mice and Karp-infected BALB/cDub mice, consistently maintained a detectable rickettsemia over a 1-year period. Rickettsiae were recovered from the spleens of 95% (19 of 20) of these mice 52 weeks postinfection. In contrast, mice with infections of reduced pathogenicity, i.e., BALB/cDub mice infected by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation with Gilliam, did not have detectable rickettsemia from week 20 through week 52 postinfection except for a single mouse on week 44 postinfection. Rickettsiae were detected in the spleens of only 40% (8 of 20) of these mice after 1 year. In both Gilliam-infected mouse strains, protection against heterologous challenge with Karp or Kato rickettsial strains was incomplete up to 7 days postimmunization. Infections of reduced pathogenicity did not result from an enhanced systemic immune response by the host. The onset of the humoral response was not different for the pathogenic and reduced-pathogenicity infections. Pathogenicity differences seemed to result from the more rapid growth of the rickettsiae in the pathogenic infections."
