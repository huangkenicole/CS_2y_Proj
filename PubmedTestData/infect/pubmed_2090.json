        "This study describes experimental infections in 4-week-old chickens inoculated intravenously with approximately 10(8) colony-forming units Streptococcus gallinaceus strain CCUG 42692T (C13156) or Enterococcus hirae strain DSM 20160 (C17410). Birds were necropsied following death and obvious clinical signs of disease or were euthanized weekly after infection for up to 4 weeks. At necropsy, lesions included splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, valvular and/or mural endocarditis. Cardiac lesions included focal necrotizing myocarditis and/or yellow-white vegetative valvular endocarditis or greyish proliferations associated with the mitral valves in 35% (6/20) and 79% (19/24) of birds infected with S. gallinaceus and in 20% (4/20) and 55% (12/22) of birds infected with E. hirae via the brachial and jugular veins, respectively. S. gallinaceus was reisolated from heart valves in 45% (9/20) and 75% (18/24) and E. hirae in 35% (7/20) and 73% (16/22) after inoculation via brachial and jugular veins, respectively. Both challenge strains were also isolated from liver, spleen, bone marrow and hock joints. A significant difference between the infections with the two strains was seen only with reisolation of E. hirae from hock joints (P < 0.007). Significant differences were apparent between the two inoculation routes only with E. hirae, where infection via the jugular vein was associated with higher culture positive isolations from the heart (P = 0.029), bone marrow (P = 0.002) and hock joints (P < 0.001) compared with the brachial vein. Birds injected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline were negative for culture of the challenge strains and no lesions were observed in these controls. The results confirm that both S. gallinaceus and E. hirae can cause endocarditis in experimentally infected chickens."
