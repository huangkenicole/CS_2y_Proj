      "AbstractText": [
        "Infection control needs user-friendly standardized instruments to measure the compliance to guidelines and to implement targeted improvement actions. This abstract describes a tool to measure the quality of infection control and antimicrobial use, the Infection Risk Scan (IRIS). It has been applied in a hospital, several nursing homes and a rehabilitation clinic in the Netherlands.",
        "The IRIS consists of a set of objective reproducible measurements, combining patient- and healthcare related variables, such as: hand hygiene compliance, environmental contamination using ATP measurements, prevalence of resistant microorganisms by active screening, availability of infection control preconditions, personal hygiene of healthcare workers, appropriate use of indwelling medical devices and appropriate use of antimicrobials. Results are visualized in a spider plot using traffic light colors to facilitate the interpretation.",
        "The IRIS provided ward specific results within the hospital that were the basis for targeted improvement programs resulting in measurable improvements. Hand hygiene compliance increased from 43% to 66% (more than 1000 observations per IRIS, <i>p</i>\u00a0<\u20090.000) and ATP levels were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.000). In the nursing homes, large differences were observed with environmental contamination as common denominator. Most remarkable were the difference in Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) prevalence (mean 11%, range 0-21%).",
        "The bundle approach and visualization of the IRIS makes it a useful infection prevention tool providing standardization and transparency. Targeted interventions can be started based on the results of the improvement plot and repeated IRIS can show the effect of interventions. In that way, a quality control cycle with continuous improvement can be achieved."

  "CoiStatement": "According to the Dutch regulation for research with human subjects, neither medical nor ethical approval was required to conduct the surveillance since it was part of the local hospital/nursing home policy, patients/residents provided oral informed consent and all data were processed anonymously. The, non-invasive, perianal swabs were collected as part of the local hospital policy which is considered routine care. The periodically performed surveys for the presence of multi drug resistant micro-organisms are part of the infection control policy in our hospital. This includes contact tracing, active search in patients with risk factors and routinely check-ups like the yearly prevalence survey. Swabs were not specifically collected for the purposes of this publication.Not applicableThe interest declare that they have no competing interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."
