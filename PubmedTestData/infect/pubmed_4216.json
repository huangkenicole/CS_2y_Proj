      "AbstractText": [
        "Three-week-old turkeys were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) of putative variant Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) strains M876, M35, or the virulent S6 reference strain. Uninoculated turkeys in each group served as contact sentinels. The hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine serologic responses. MG was isolated from 100% and 92% of S6- and M876-inoculated turkeys, respectively, on day 7 PI. However, culture-positive rates among M876-inoculated turkeys declined more rapidly, transmission to contact sentinels took longer and occurred at lower rates, and serologic responses measured by HI and ELISA were lower than in S6-infected turkeys. Testing sera from inoculated turkeys for antibodies to MG in homologous and heterologous ELISA systems indicated that strain M876 was significantly (P less than 0.05) less immunogenic than S6 (days 62 and 95 PI), and that the homologous ELISA was more sensitive (P less than 0.005). MG strain M35 failed to infect turkeys in three attempts, even though the inocula used were viable on culture media."
