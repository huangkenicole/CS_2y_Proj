        "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a pathogen associated with respiratory tract infection and is related to avian pneumovirus. Typically, children, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised are the most susceptible to HMPV infection; however, the virus can infect persons of all ages. In otherwise healthy individuals, HMPV infection is generally self-limiting, but immunocompromised individuals can develop fatal complications. We present a case series of 3 severely immunocompromised patients who were infected with HMPV and describe their clinical course. All 3 patients had acute myeloid leukemia, histories of neutropenic fever, and prolonged hospitalization stays. This case series highlights the severe sequelae observed in individuals infected with HMPV, particularly among those who are immunocompromised."
