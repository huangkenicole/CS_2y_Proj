        "A simple model of infective endocarditis was produced in rats. With the aid of a guide wire, polyethylene catheters were passed into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery of Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g. A volume of 1 ml of an overnight culture of Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis was intravenously injected 1 to 2 days after catheterization. Bacterial titers of Streptococcus mitis in vegetations were about 10(4)-fold greater than in other tissues. Blood cultures were always positive after 6 h. Mortality was 19% at 1 week and 82% at 2 weeks. Catheters were pulled 24 h after infection, and vegetation titers of greater than 7.0 log10 colony-forming units per g were sustained at 5 days. In intravenously infected rats without catheters, blood and tissues were sterile after 3 to 5 days. With Staphylococcus aureus, vegetations had greater than 9.0 log10 colony-forming units and with Streptococcus faecalis 8.8 +/- 0.3 log10 colony-forming units per g at 2 days. The rat model of infective endocarditis should prove to be suitable for further pathological and therapeutic studies."
