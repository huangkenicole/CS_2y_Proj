        "The virulence of the uropathogenic E. coli strain 536 (O6:K15:H31) which produces the S-fimbrial adhesin (Sfa+), is serum-resistant (Sre+) and hemolytic (Hly+) and its derivatives were assessed in five different animal models. Cloned hemolysin (hly) determinants from the chromosomes of O6, O18 and O75 E. coli strains and from the plasmid pHly152 were introduced into the spontaneous Sfa-, Sre-, Hly- mutant 536-21 and its Sfa+, Sre+, Hly- variant 536-31. As already demonstrated for the 536-21 strains (Infect. Immun. 42: 57-63) the O18-hly determinant but not the plasmid-encoded hly determinant of pHly152 transformed into 536-31 contribute to lethality in a mouse peritonitis model. Similar results were obtained with both Hly- host strains and their Hly+ transformants in a chicken embryo test and in a mouse nephropathogenicity assay in which the renal bacterial counts were measured 15 min to 8 hours after i.v. infection. S-fimbriae and serum resistance had only a marginal influence in these three in vivo systems. In contrast all three factors, S-fimbriae, serum resistance and hemolysin, were necessary for full virulence in a respiratory mouse infection assay. In a subcutaneously-induced sepsis model in the mouse restoration of S-fimbriae and serum resistance and separately chromosomally-encoded hemolysis increased virulence to a level comparable to that of the parental 536 strain."
