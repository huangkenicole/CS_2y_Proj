        "Helicobacter Pylori (H Pylori) that infects about 90% people of developing countries causes dyspepsia and upper gastrointestinal lesions. The aim of this study was to detect the trend of H Pylori active infection and to investigate the endoscopic findings of H Pylori infected dyspeptic patient of Bangladesh. In this prospective study, 360 dyspeptic patients (Male-251, Female-109) were recruited. Patients having alarm features, history of gastrectomy and malignancy were excluded from this study. Non-invasive fecal antigen test for H Pylori was done of all patients. All selected patients were sent for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Helicobacter Pylori fecal antigen was found positive in 134(37.2%) from 360 dyspeptic patients (age 14-80 years). Among 360 patients 303 (80.16%) had macroscopic endoscopic mucosal lesions. H Pylori infected 114 patients had endoscopic mucosal abnormality. H Pylori non-infected 189 patients also had mucosal lesion. Twenty patients (35.08%) had H Pylori infection among the 57 patients having endoscopic normal looking mucosa. This study revealed that active H Pylori infection rate is declining in Bangladesh. Risk of endoscopic mucosal lesion is more expected in H Pylori active infection."
