      "AbstractText": [
        "Aleutian disease virus (ADV), an autonomous parvovirus, persistently infects mink and induces very high levels of virus-specific antibody. All strains of ADV infect all mink, but only highly virulent strains cause progressive disease in non-Aleutian mink. The development of antibody to individual ADV proteins was evaluated by Western blotting by using the sera of 22 uninfected mink and 163 naturally or experimentally infected mink. ADV has virion proteins of 86,000 and 78,000 daltons that are closely related. A new, possibly nonvirion protein of 143,000 daltons was observed, as well as a known nonvirion protein of 71,000 daltons. Sera from mink experimentally or naturally infected with ADV of high or low virulence generally reacted about equally with all four proteins. The only exceptions noted were that 8 of 15 sera of mink infected transplacentally preferentially reacted with the two virion proteins and sera from mink with the monoclonal gammopathy of Aleutian disease reacted preferentially with either virion (10 of 12) or nonvirion (2 of 12) proteins."
