        "An experimental infection model for the heteroecious spiruid nematode Tetrameres americana (Cram 1927) was developed. The cockroach Blattella germanica (L.) and the locust Locusta migratoria (L.) were found to serve as intermediate hosts for the parasite. T. americana larvae developed to full maturity in these intermediate hosts and were infective to young Lohman Brown chickens after 32 days in the cockroach and 28 days in the locust. The maximum length of the larvae was reached in the insects at 28-30 degrees C after 10-15 days, at which time the larvae measured up to 2.2 mm. The parasite did not develop in the cockroach Periplaneta americana (L.), the woodlouse Oniscus asellus (L.), or the pupal stage of the giant mealworm Zophobas morio (Fabricius). Trials in which chickens were infected directly without an intermediate host failed. Infection of 24 chickens with a dosage of 100 larvae was followed by weekly post-mortems until day 48 post-infection (p.i.) and used to describe the development of T. americana. The average establishment rate (%) and the average worm burden varied from 16.5 to 30.8. The total numbers of parasites recovered ranged from 9 to 40. During mating, in the first 2 weeks p.i. females and males were equally abundant, whereas from day 20 p.i. twice as many females were recovered. From day 13 p.i. the females average length fluctuated between 2.6 and 3.7 mm, whereas they reached their maximum width of 2.4 mm on day 48 p.i. Males reached their full length after 27 days p.i. and measured up to 6.7 mm."
