        "Cells from all domains of life release extracellular vesicles (EVs), packages that carry a cargo of molecules that participate in communication, co-ordination of population behaviours, virulence and immune response mechanisms. Mammalian EVs play an increasingly recognised role to fight infection, yet may also be commandeered to disseminate pathogens and enhance infection. EVs released by bacterial pathogens may deliver toxins to host cells, signalling molecules and new DNA to other bacteria, and act as decoys, protecting infecting bacteria from immune killing. In this review, we explore the role of EVs in infection from the perspective of both the pathogen and host, and highlight their importance in the host/pathogen relationship. We highlight proposed strategies for EVs in therapeutics, and call attention to areas where existing knowledge and evidence is lacking."
