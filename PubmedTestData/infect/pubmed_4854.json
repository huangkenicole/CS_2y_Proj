        "Histoplasma capsulatum filamentous primary isolates and their subcultures are separable into two distinct colonial types (A and B) having different microscopic characteristics. Yeast forms of the A and B types and the parent (P) strains from which they are derived are microscopically indistinguishable. Critically standardized inocula of living P, A, and B yeasts from one strain of H. capsulatum (G-184) were injected intravenously into 12 rabbits. Each type produced progressively debilitating disease, but in varying degrees. Of the 12 animals, 6 died within 2 to 14 weeks. A persisting copious nasal exudate, beginning at or before 1 week, was cultured weekly at 26 C on Mycosel (BBL) agar. Pure cultures of A and B filamentous type colonies were recovered from exudates of animals receiving A and B yeasts, respectively, whereas both filamentous types were isolated from rabbits injected with P yeasts, with B predominating. Only A and B yeasts thus maintained their filamentous integrity during animal passage. It was noted that dissemination of H. capsulatum through the nares of infected rabbits represents a possible hazard to laboratory personnel heretofore unrecognized. It is also a possible means of cross-infecting or sensitizing or cross-infecting and sensitizing animals housed in the same room, if A and B yeasts prove not to be antigenically identical."
