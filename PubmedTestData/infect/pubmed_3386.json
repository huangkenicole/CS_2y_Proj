        "When active infective endocarditis (IE) involves a bioprosthetic valve, the infective process may involve only the cusps or sewing ring or both. We studied 34 patients with infected bioprostheses to determine whether the infection involved the cusps or ring, or both, because these locations could affect prognosis. In the 5 patients in whom active IE began < 60 days after operation, the infection involved the cusps only in 2, the ring only in 2, and both in 1. The 29 patients in whom signs and symptoms of active IE appeared > 60 days after valve replacement were subdivided into 3 categories based on the valve or valves replaced. In the 16 patients with isolated aortic valve replacement, the infection involved the cusps only in 6, the ring only in 4, and both in 6. In the 6 patients with isolated mitral valve replacement, the infection involved the cusps only in 2, the ring only in 1, and both in 3. In the remaining 7 patients, 15 native valves were replaced with bioprostheses, and 10 of them were infected. The infection involved the cusps only in 7, and both the cusps and ring in 3. Of all 34 patients, 13 had operative excision of the infected bioprosthesis: 1 died within 60 days of the bioprosthetic excision, and 1 was lost to follow-up; of the remaining 11 patients, 4 died late (1.5, 3, 5 and 14 years), and the other 7 are alive 5 to 10 years after bioprosthetic excision (all in New York Heart Association functional class I or II). Thus, although infection limited to the bioprosthetic cusps may reasonably allow a better outlook, reoperation with infection involving the annular ring (8 of 13 reoperation patients) does not prevent successful outcome."
