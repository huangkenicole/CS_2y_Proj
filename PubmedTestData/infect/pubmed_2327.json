        "The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a Polish low-virulence isolate of haemorrhagic enteritis adenovirus (HEV) on the immune system in turkeys and on the course of colibacillosis in birds infected under laboratory conditions. Turkeys were infected per os with HEV at the dose of 10(4.3)EID50/mL and with E. coli (APEC) (serotypes 078:K80:H9) at the dose of 4x10(9)CFU/mL by injection to the thoracic air sac. The birds infected with the HEV were infected with the APEC either simultaneously or after 5 days. Five days after HEV infection, the percentages of subpopulations of the CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8alpha+ T cells and the IgM+ B cells were determined in blood and spleens of the HEV-infected turkeys and in the control (uninfected) birds. The course of colibacillosis was more severe in turkeys infected with the APEC 5 days after infection with the HEV than in those infected with the HEV and APEC simultaneously and than in those infected only with APEC. Five turkeys out of the 18 infected with the APEC 5 days after infection with HEV, died. Their body weights were statistically significantly lower with higher FCR values 41 days after the infection in comparison to turkeys in the other groups. A considerable decrease in the percentage of the T and B cells subpopulations in the blood were found in turkeys infected with the HEV and while the percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells subpopulation in the spleen increased significantly, the contribution of the CD3+CD8alpha+ T cells and IgM+ B cells subpopulations were decreased. These changes in the immune system of turkeys, occurring 5 days after infection with the HEV, made them more susceptible to infection with the APEC."
