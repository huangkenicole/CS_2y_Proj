        "Trichomonas vaginalis infection causes significant morbidity in the United States. Despite its high national disease burden, the epidemiologic characteristics of child and adolescent cases are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to describe the socioeconomic, transmission risk factors, clinical manifestations, and geospatial variables associated with cases of T vaginalis infection in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area.",
        "We performed a retrospective chart abstraction of all T vaginalis cases at 2 large pediatric hospitals in Houston between 2008 and 2016.",
        "We identified 87 patients (mean age, 16 years; range, 4-18 years); 30% of them were asymptomatic, and 39% were coinfected with another sexually transmitted infection(s). Almost all T vaginalis infections in sexually assaulted patients were diagnosed incidentally. Geospatial analysis identified clustering of cases in areas of high poverty and in minority populations.",
        "Our findings indicate that children and adolescents are at risk for T vaginalis infection; however, their risk factors might differ from those in adults. In addition, our geospatial analysis revealed the need for dedicated resources in neighborhoods associated with health disparities to prevent future incident cases."
