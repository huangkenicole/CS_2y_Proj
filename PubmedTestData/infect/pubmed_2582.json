        "<i>Chlamydia psittaci</i> is the pathogen of psittacosis and infects a wide range of birds and even humans. Human infection occurs most commonly in those with a history of contact with birds or poultry. We describe a case of psittacosis in a human immunodeficiency virus infected patient in Zhejiang Province for the first time. <i>C. psittaci</i> infection was confirmed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-Time PCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences from the patient's samples clustered with genotype A in the same branch. Our study highlights the possibility of diagnosing psittacosis in patients with a chronic disease such as HIV-infected patients, and should increase awareness and surveillance of psittacosis in China."
