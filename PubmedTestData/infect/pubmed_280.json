        "Piglets between 1 and 40 days of age were inoculated with varying numbers and with different isolates of Streptococcus suis type 2 by the intranasal, intravenous and subarachnoid routes. Less than 100 organisms of an isolate cultured from apparently normal pigs caused subclinical infection in 1-day-old piglets after intranasal inoculation. This infection was naturally transmitted between litter mates. Intravenous inoculation of a similar isolate in 7-week-old pigs resulted in a sub-clinical bacteraemia in 3 of 8 piglets. One other piglet developed a bacteraemia 7 days after inoculation and concurrently developed signs of lameness and nervous dysfunction. Ten piglets were inoculated by the subarachnoid route with a porcine isolate and two with an isolate from a person with clinical disease. Only the latter two pigs developed the classical signs of nervous disease associated with infection by S. suis type 2. It is concluded that strains of S. suis type 2, of varying pathogenicity for both pigs and man, are endemic in New Zealand. It is suggested that the occurrence of disease is associated with both exposure to a pathogenic strain and other, as yet undetermined, secondary factors."
