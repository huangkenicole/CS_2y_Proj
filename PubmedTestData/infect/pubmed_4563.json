      "AbstractText": [
        "Twelve batches of 100 Cochlicella barbara (Mollusca, Helicidae) were deposited monthly, from January to December in plots (0.5 x 0.5 m) with faeces of sheep containing first-stage larvae of Neostrongylus linearis in order to be naturally infected, and another 12 batches acted as uninfected controls. Every 2 weeks dead molluscs were removed from the plots and three to five specimens were examined to study larval development in the snail. Infected and control snails did not differ in their mortality, which may be associated with the low rate of infection of snails. The highest number of molluscs that were infected and the maximum level of infection were observed in batches deposited in summer months. There was a positive correlation between the percentage of infected snails and temperature. Molluscs harboured higher number of infectious third-stage larvae (L3) from mid-spring to mid-autumn and especially in summer months; thus under these climatic conditions and periods small ruminants are more likely to get infected by N. linearis."
