        "Infected wounds are painful and cannot heal, with antibiotics showing reduced efficacy. Appropriate wound electrotherapy may limit incident planktonic and polymicrobial colonization, inhibit biofilm formation and accelerate healing.",
        "The Modular Adaptive Electrotherapy Delivery System (MAEDS) is a lightweight, flexible, battery-powered disposable bandage which delivers controlled reliable electrotherapy to the wound for up to 7 days. Large full-thickness excisional wounds (6 cm diameter) were created in a porcine model and freshly cultured 0.5 McFarland green fluorescent protein-labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa evenly applied to the wound bed. Control wounds received standard wound care, Tegaderm HP Transparent Dressing (3 M Health Care, St. Paul, MN, USA) applied in a sterile fashion. Treatment wounds received MAEDS electrotherapy for up to 28 days or until healed. Onboard Bluetooth facilitated remote real-time monitoring of MAEDS function. Dressing changes occurred on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Punch biopsies were taken at the wound margin and center. Bacterial samples were processed to determine infection status.",
        "Acute infected wounds treated with MAEDS electrotherapy were 92% smaller than baseline by POD21. Healing rate was significantly faster (p < 0.01) and infection significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) at POD10, relative to control wounds.",
        "The MAEDS electrotherapy can significantly inhibit infection and enhance healing rate in acute infected wounds."
