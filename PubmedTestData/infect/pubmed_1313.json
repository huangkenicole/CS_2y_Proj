        "Giardia and Cryptosporidium are enteric protozoan parasites that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Both are transmitted either by direct faecal/oral contact or by the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The discovery of morphologically similar organisms infecting humans and a variety of mammals and birds has led to the proposal that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are zoonotic (i.e. transmitted in nature between humans and animals). Transmission between humans and animals has been supported by cross-infection studies. However, closer examination of many of these studies reveals limitations in the methodologies utilised. More recent molecular genetic studies have demonstrated considerable genetic diversity among isolates of the same species of Giardia and Cryptosporidium, suggesting that these species are in fact species complexes and that some of these novel species may be host-specific. This paper will critically examine the evidence for the zoonotic transmission of these parasites."
