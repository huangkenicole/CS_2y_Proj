        "Many insect species carry inherited Spiroplasma bacteria which act as important partners and antagonists. The nature of symbioses between Spiroplasma and insects has been most extensively studied in the interaction between male-killing Spiroplasma infection and Drosophila melanogaster. For historical reasons, these studies have largely focussed on the Spiroplasma strain known as NSRO, derived from Drosophila nebulosa and transinfected into D. melanogaster. More recently, D. melanogaster naturally infected with Spiroplasma were discovered. Whilst the well studied strain NSRO is closely related to that found natively in D. melanogaster, it is unclear whether strains from D. nebulosa reflect a natural interaction when placed in D. melanogaster. In this paper, we determine if NSRO has similar or different properties from strains of Spiroplasma naturally infecting D. melanogaster in terms of transmission efficiency and the strength and timing of male-killing. Native infections were observed to have higher transmission efficiency than introduced NSRO infections during the early phases of host reproduction, but not during late reproduction. The timing and intensity of male-killing did not differ between infection classes. As a precautionary measure, it is proposed that future work seeking to reveal the nature of coevolved Spiroplasma-Drosophila interactions use the native strain."
