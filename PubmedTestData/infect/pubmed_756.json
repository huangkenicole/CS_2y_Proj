        "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the most common halophilic Vibrio species causing serious gastroenteritis in humans. The main source of infection is consumption of undercooked or raw seafood or exposure to contaminated water. The monitoring conducted in 2006-2008 demonstrated that warm, subtropical climate and low- to moderate salinity of water in the Black Sea coastal zone provides a favorable environment for growth and spread of V. parahaemolyticus bacteria. Antibiotics are commonly applied for control V.parahaemolyticus infections in humans. However, with the growing problem with bacterial antibiotic-resistance search for alternative biological anti-infectives, such as bacteriophages, becomes more actual. The aim of the presented work was characterization of V. parahamolyticus- specific bacteriophages in relation with their possible use for treatment and prevention of food and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans infected with V.parahaemolyticus. 69 bacteriophages specific to V.parahaemolyticus were isolated from different water sources and 5 of them were characterized according to their virion morphology, host-range, temperature and pH dependence. Stability of phages in different media and solutions, also susceptibility to action of a number of protolithic enzymes was studied as well. Obtained results showed that studied bacteriophages can be used for preparation of phage mixture as a potential therapeutic preparation against V.parahaemolyticus associated infections."
