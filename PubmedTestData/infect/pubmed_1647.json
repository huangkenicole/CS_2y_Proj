        "Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the pathogen causing hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in broilers. Since June 2015, it has emerged as one of the leading causes of economic losses in the poultry industry in China. Although most studies on FAdV-4 have focused on its pathogenicity to broilers, limited studies have been performed on other natural hosts such as ducks and geese. In this study, we assessed the pathogenicity of FAdV-4 to ducks of different ages through intramuscular injection and found that infected ducks showed severe growth depression. The infected ducks also suffered from extensive organ damage and had histopathological changes in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Although the virus infection caused lymphocyte necrosis of immune organs and the development of the bursa of Fabricius (bursa) was inhibited, the humoral immune response of infected ducks to FAdV-4 remained strong. The infected ducks also had high viral load in tissues and shed virus after the challenge. Overall, our research demonstrates that FAdV-4 can infect ducks and adversely affect the productivity of animals. And the viruses shed by infected ducks can pose a potential risk to the same or other poultry flocks."
