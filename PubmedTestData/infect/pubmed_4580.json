        "The organ distribution and pathogenecity of Orungo virus were studied in Swiss Albino mice following intracerebral and intraperitoneal inoculations. There was an age-related response in mice to Orungo virus ic infection. Virus multiplied to higher titres in the brain of newborn (2-day-old) mice than in the other organs. The histopathologic changes which were restricted to the brain included diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration, prominent perivascular and interstitial oedema in the cerebrum and cerebellum. In 10-day-old mice, low level infective virus was detected only in the brain, with resultant mild and focal mononuclear cell infiltration in the cerebral cortex. Recovery from Orungo virus ic infection in 10-day-old animals is accompanied by stunted growth. Orungo virus did not multiply in 21-day-old mice which were found to be histologically unremarkable. Following ip inoculation Orungo virus did not multiply, nor was there an histopathological change in inoculated newborn, 10-day or 21-day-old mice."
