        "To reduce the frequency and severity of bacterial infection, selective antimicrobial modulation (SAM) was applied in 39 patients with severely decreased host defense mechanisms. The objective was to eliminate potentially pathogenic aerobic microorganisms with minimal disturbance of the normal anaerobic bacterial flora. Elimination of potentially pathogenic aerobic microorganisms was easily accomplished in patients not infected at hospitalization. The anaerobic flora seemed to be undisturbed, and selection of or overgrowth with resistant microorganisms did not occur. The microbiologic results of the SAM regimen correlated with the incidence of infection. Only three major infections occurred in 23 patients who were free of potentially pathogenic microorganisms; 10 major infections occurred in 16 patients who were not free of potential pathogens. Seven of these 10 infections were present at hospitalization. The incidence of major infections was 47% in the patients on the SAM regimen and 82% in a group of control patients with a similar risk of infection."
