        "Host specificity of parasites may depend both on ecological and physiological factors. Basic descriptions of the susceptibility/resistance of fish to specific nematodes are needed in order to reveal mechanisms in the host-parasite relation. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were orally infected with larval stages of three different anisakid nematodes-Hysterothylacium aduncum, Contracaecum osculatum, and Anisakis simplex-and parasite survival and location was subsequently recorded for up to 14 days post infection (dpi). H. aduncum was most prevalent and numerous in brown trout 2 dpi, but a large proportion of the worms were recovered dead. No tissue penetration was observed. Rainbow trout exhibited the highest susceptibility to C. osculatum larvae at 2, 7, and 14 dpi. Mean intensities and mean abundances were lower in brown trout and salmon at all time points. The pyloric cecum was penetrated in rainbow trout on two occasions. A. simplex larvae established more successfully in salmon compared to rainbow trout; brown trout exhibited the highest natural resistance. Mean intensity and mean abundance was highest in rainbow trout at 2 and 7 dpi, but not after 14 days. A range of tissues, including muscle and liver, were found penetrated by larvae, but the pyloric ceca were the preferred microhabitat for Anisakis in both rainbow trout and salmon. It can be concluded that closely related salmonids differ in susceptibility towards different anisakid larvae and these parasites select different microhabitats in the hosts. The physiological basis for this specificity is discussed."
