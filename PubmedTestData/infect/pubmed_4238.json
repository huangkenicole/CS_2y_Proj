        "In Egypt, Nile tilapia represents the main cultured type due to its economical price, palatability and easy culturing. This study was aimed to elucidate the pathogenicity of V. alginolyticus isolated from diseased sea bass and experimentally infected healthy Nile tilapia fish.",
        "Healthy Nile tilapia fish were injected I/P with V. alginolyticus isolated from diseased sea bass. Symptoms and mortality rates of infected Nile tilapia fish were recorded during the experimental period. Re-isolation of V. alginolyticus was done from infected tilapia fish by bacteriological methods. For confirmation the pathogenicity of Vibrio isolated either from marine fish or tilapia fish, PCR test was done using tdh and bla gens. Liver and kidney function tests with histopathological examinations of some organs were performed. Treatment trial was done according to the antibiotic sensitivity test.",
        "The isolated Vibrio is highly pathogenic to Nile tilapia fish causing deterioration in all parameters which finished by severe mortalities. Treatment with florfenicol, enrofloxacin, or oxytetracycline reduced the mortality rate and improved liver and kidney function parameters of infected Nile tilapia fish.",
        "V. alginolyticus can infect both marine and fresh water fish inducing a high mortality rate. Treatment of infected fish with florfenicol, enrofloxacin, or oxytetracycline reduces the mortality rate."
