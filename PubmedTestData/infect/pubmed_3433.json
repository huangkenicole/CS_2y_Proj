        "Disseminated strongyloidiasis is often associated with enteric bacterial infections. This study was undertaken to determine if enteric organisms caused extraintestinal infections in patients infected with Strongyloides stercoralis but without apparent dissemination. The medical records of hospitalized patients from central Kentucky with strongyloidiasis (1993-2003) were examined to determine the occurrence of extraintestinal infections with enteric organisms. Of 30 patients with S stercoralis, 16 had invasive infections, including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, peritonitis, and endocarditis caused by enteric bacteria and Candida organisms. Infections were seen in 8 (62%) of 13 patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis and 8 (47%) of 17 with disease apparently limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Fifteen patients were receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Peripheral eosinophilia was seen in only 23% (7/30). Infection with S stercoralis, even without obvious dissemination, may predispose to invasive infections caused by enteric organisms. In Strongyloides-endemic areas, patients with invasive infections caused by enteric organisms should be examined for coinfection with S stercoralis."
