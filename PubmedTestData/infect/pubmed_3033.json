        "In the present study, an in vivo rabbit skin infection model was developed to reproduce the lesions caused by high and low virulence Staphylococcus aureus strains from rabbits. \"O\"-shaped dermal skin lesions were induced on the shaved flanks of anaesthetised rabbits using a tattoo pin and pincers. The induced lesions on the flanks of four groups of 10 rabbits were then inoculated by topical application of 0.1 ml of 10(8)cfu S. aureus bacteria. One group was inoculated with a typical high virulence (HV) S. aureus strain from rabbits, one group received an atypical HV strain and two groups were inoculated with low virulence (LV) strains. Five animals were kept as negative controls. The development, appearance and size of abscesses were scored daily for a period of 2 weeks. The infection model showed reproducible results for the different S. aureus inoculation groups. Inoculation of the skin with the typical HV strain resulted in significantly larger abscesses than those caused by the LV strains. The atypical HV strain caused abscesses of a size intermediate to that obtained with the HV and LV strains. In rabbits infected with LV strains, most of the lesions had healed by day 14 post-inoculation. The devised infection model is able to reliably reproduce the virulence properties of HV and LV S. aureus strains."
