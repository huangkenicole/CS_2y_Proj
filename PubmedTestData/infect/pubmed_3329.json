        "Acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative coccobacillus that causes outbreaks of nosocomial infections in ICUs. Due to resistance to multiple antibiotics, management of clusters of A. baumannii is useful as a model in eradication of multi-drug resistant infections. We outline the evolution of an A. baumannii outbreak, focusing on methods of transmission and multidisciplinary measures aimed at eliminating it from the ICU.",
        "Patients in an urban, tertiary care medical center from November 1996 to December 1997 having positive cultures for multi-drug resistant A. baumannii are included in this study. A. baumannii was isolated on blood agar and MacConkey cultures and identified by Vitek panel. Disk diffusion including amikacin, imipenem, polymyxin B, and sulbactam were used to determine resistance.",
        "An outbreak of 52 patients (27 infected, 25 colonized) with 68 positive sites began with the transfer of a colonized >50% total body surface area burn patient from an outside hospital. Within 3 days, the index patient was in the burn ICU, coronary care unit, and medical ICU. Soon, clusters of patients with A. baumannii infections sensitive only to polymyxin B were seen in those units and, ultimately, the surgical ICU. On typing, 2 strains were found, PFGE B and C. Given the level of antibiotic resistance, patients with colonization or infection were cohorted and placed on contact isolation. Strict antiseptic measures, such as hand-washing, barrier isolation, equipment and room cleaning, sterilization of ventilator equipment, and dedication of medical equipment to each patient were instituted. Still, positive environmental cultures were found in ventilator water traps, sinks, and bedrails. Sporadic cases continued for a total of 13 months, with 10 deaths resulting from the infections.",
        "A. baumannii is a mildly virulent organism that becomes resistant to antimicrobials. Because of multiple antibiotic resistance, strict contact isolation cohorting and antiseptic technique are the primary modes of containment. This outbreak serves as a model of eradication of multi-drug resistant organisms from ICUs. These measures will become of greater importance as nosocomial organisms develop increasing resistance to antimicrobials."
