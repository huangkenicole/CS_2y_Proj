        "While the role of hemostatic activity is well established, the importance of infection prevention in the wound has not been addressed. Based on the available evidence from disinfection and infection prevention, essential oils are attractive candidates for antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, we hypothesize to design a novel hemostatic model with triple protective functions through coordinating essential oils to hematostatic ingredients. The hematostatic ingredients play their roles in hemostasis when hemorrhage occurs. Simultaneously, the essential oils evaporate naturally to form a protective layer around the wound, which can help to prevent pathogenic bacteria from infecting the wound. What more, most plant essential oils possess antibacterial activity. Thus, the essential oils can be used as an accessory treatment for infection once the wound infected by pathogenic bacteria. So the novel hematostatic model with triple protective functions will have broader utility in therapy of out-wound bleeding than current hemostatic drugs."
