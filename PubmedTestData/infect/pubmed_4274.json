        "Adhesion is an important aspect of bacterial colonisation and induction of human disease. Escherichia coli which infects and causes disease of the urinary tract expresses several adherence factors including type 1 and P fimbriae. Their expression has been implicated in the virulence of E. coli strains infecting the urinary tract, however, the evidence for the expression of these fimbriae in situ has been implied rather than proven. Here we describe in situ detection of E. coli and of fimbrial expression in urinary tract tissue. Kidneys and bladders were isolated from mice infected with the uropathogenic isolate E. coli AD110. The tissue was sectioned and subjected to DNA-rRNA hybridization and indirect immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against type 1 and P fimbriae. Sections of both kidney and bladder stained positive for bacterial cells using a Cy3-labelled E. coli-specific rRNA probe. The same cells in these sections also stained positive for type 1 or P fimbriae using fluorescein-labelled antibodies. Tissue taken from several different time points (2, 6, and 24 hours post infection) showed the presence of bacterial cells which stained positive for fimbrial expression. Bacteria in kidney and bladder sections were observed either as individual cells associated with the mucosa or as members of microcolonies."
