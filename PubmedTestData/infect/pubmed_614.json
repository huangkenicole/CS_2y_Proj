        "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies arise as a consequence of infection of the central nervous system by prions, where neurons and glial cells are regarded as primary targets. Neuronal loss and gliosis, associated with the accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrP), are hallmarks of prion diseases; yet the mechanisms underlying such disorders remain unclear. Here we introduced a cell system based on primary cerebellar cultures established from transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP and then exposed to sheep scrapie agent. Upon exposure to low doses of infectious agent, such cultures, unlike cultures originating from PrP null mice, were found to accumulate de novo abnormal PrP and infectivity, as assessed by mouse bioassay. Importantly, using astrocyte and neuron/astrocyte cocultures, both cell types were found capable of sustaining efficient prion propagation independently, leading to the production of proteinase K-resistant PrP of the same electrophoretic profile as in diseased brain. Moreover, contrasting with data obtained in chronically infected cell lines, late-occurring apoptosis was consistently demonstrated in the infected neuronal cultures. Our results provide evidence that primary cultured neural cells, including postmitotic neurons, are permissive to prion replication, thus establishing an approach to study the mechanisms involved in prion-triggered neurodegeneration at a cellular level."
