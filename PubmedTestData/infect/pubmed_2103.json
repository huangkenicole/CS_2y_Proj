        "Pigs are considered to be suitable xenotransplantation organ donors. However, the risk of pathogen transmission from pigs to humans is a major concern in the transplantation of porcine tissues. The porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) PERV-A, PERV-A/C, and PERV-B can infect human cells, but PERV-C is an ecotropic virus infecting only pig cells. Thus, several strategies have been proposed to reduce PERV transmission in xenograft recipients. Human APOBEC3G (huA3G) is a single-strand DNA cytosine deaminase, which inactivates the coding capacity of the virus by deamination of cDNA cytosines to uracils. This reaction occurs within the (-) DNA strand during reverse transcription, resulting in a G-to-A mutation in the (+) strand. While recent data have shown that PERV-B is severely inhibited by huA3G and porcine A3Z2-Z3 (poA3F) in a pseudotype assay, little is known about PERV-C. Here, we compare the antiretroviral activities of huA3G, huA3F and poA3Z2-Z3 against PERV-C. Our data show that APOBEC3 was packaged into PERV-C particles and inhibited PERV-C replication in a dose-dependent manner. PERV-C infectivity was strongly inhibited by poA3Z2-Z3, but it did not markedly reduce PERV-B infectivity. This suggests that PERV-C Gag interacts efficiently with poA3Z2-Z3. In addition, we constructed stably huA3G- and poA3Z2-Z3-expressing 293-PERV-PK-CIRCE cells (human 293 cells infected with PK15-derived PERVs) to examine whether PERV is resistant to poA3Z2-Z3 in a virus-spreading assay. The stably expressed huA3G and poA3Z2-Z3 were more packaging-competent than transiently expressed APOBEC3 proteins. These results suggest that poA3Z2-Z3 can inhibit PERV replication in a pseudotype assay as well as in a virus-spreading assay."
