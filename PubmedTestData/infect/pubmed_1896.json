        "Co-infections with pathogenic microorganisms are common in aquaculture, resulting in more serious economic losses than single-pathogen infection. Infection of Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) often occurs together with infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) in Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi) culture ponds. In this study, A. hydrophila and ISKNV were inoculated into Chinese perch to mimic individual infection, secondary infection, and mixed infection. The effects of concurrent infections on the susceptibility and the immune response of the host and changes in bacterial and viral load were studied. The results showed relatively complex interaction between ISKNV and A. hydrophila for different infection modes, acting in an antagonistic or synergistic manner. The experimental groups infected with a mixture of ISKNV and A. hydrophila showed higher mortality rate than groups infected with single-pathogen or secondary infection groups, suggesting a synergistic lethal effect of A. hydrophila and ISKNV co-infection. Serious clinical symptoms and obvious histopathological changes were observed in moribund fish under the mixed-infection condition. In addition, obviously higher mortalities were caused by secondary bacterial infections than the number caused by secondary viral infections. ISKNV-primary infection increased the mortality caused by secondary bacterial infections, but A. hydrophila-primary infection did not significantly increase the mortality caused by secondary viral infections. Co-infected fish showed high expression levels of IRF1, Mx, Viperin, Hepcidin, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNAs relative to the levels in healthy fish, which suggested that the co-infection of these two pathogens activated the host immune system and caused host inflammation. These results of infection with A. hydrophila and ISKNV provided the theoretical basis to analyze the pathogenic effects and interaction between pathogens, and could facilitate design of strategies for clinical prevention and control measures of outbreak of fulminant hemorrhagic disease and bacterial sepsis in Chinese perch."
