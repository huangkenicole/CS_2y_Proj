        "Protozoa of the genus Sarcocystis are obligatory heterogenous parasites with both definitive and intermediate hosts. Opossums (Didelphis aurita) can shed multiple species of Sarcocystis with birds as the intermediate host. The pathologies of Sarcocystis species in birds have not been thoroughly elucidated. Therefore, the aim of the present study to determine the main lesions that can occur in acute and chronic infections in intermediate hosts, when they ingest infective sporocysts that are shed in the opossum's feces, using budgerigars as a model. To this end, 12 budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, were divided into two groups that received an inoculum with 60 and 120 sporocysts. Birds that died or were euthanized were necropsied, and the lung, tongue, liver, brain, heart, and skeletal striated muscles were collected and fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological analysis. The infectivity varied according to the sample and infective dose. Acute histopathological lesions were characterized by evidence of slightly degenerated hepatocyte cords that permeated the region of the blood vessel and hepatic sinusoids. Pulmonary tissue lesions were also observed in the parabronchial region with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates associated with areas of edema and atelectasis. In chronic infections, few mature cysts were observed in the chest, and many mature cysts in the thigh and tongue muscles. Thus, it was possible to conclude that lesions are highly characteristic in acute infection and, in chronic infections, cysts were present but without major lesions. In this case, the preferred organs of parasitism were the thigh and the tongue."
