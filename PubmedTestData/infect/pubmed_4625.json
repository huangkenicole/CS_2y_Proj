        "Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have repeated bacterial infection of the airways, which can lead to chronic infection. There is evidence that disease severity is determined by the genetic mutations present. This study aims to establish if CF genotype is related to the frequency and types of airway bacterial infection. Adult patients attending the regional CF unit are followed for two years and assigned to one of three groups depending on whether they are chronically infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or neither of these organisms. Genotype analysis is performed on all patients to determine which of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene mutations are present. The numbers and types of organism with the CFTR mutations isolated from sputum are identified. Data are available on 59 patients: 15 colonised with BCC, 24 colonised with P. aeruginosa, and 20 not colonised with either organism. Twenty patients were homozygous for deltaF508, 25 were heterozygous, and the deltaF508 mutation was not present in the remaining 14 patients. Patients homozygous or heterozygous for the deltaF508 mutation had an increased likelihood of colonisation with BCC or P. aeruginosa, an increased number of positive sputum cultures and a higher frequency of multiple infecting organisms. Cystic fibrosis mutational analysis identified seven patients who had the R117H mutation. These patients were less likely to be colonised with BCC or P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, patients homozygous or heterozygous for the deltaF508 deletion are more likely to suffer airway colonisation with BCC or P. aeruginosa, with increased numbers of positive sputum cultures and infecting organisms. Those with the R117H mutation are less likely to be colonised by Gram-negative organisms."
