        "The aim of the study was to compare background characteristics, microbiology and outcome of patients with right-sided and left-sided intravenous drug use (IDU) associated infective endocarditis (IE). A nationwide retrospective study using the Swedish Registry on Infective Endocarditis between 2008 and 2019 was conducted. A total of 586 people with IDU-IE were identified and divided into left-sided (n\u2009=\u2009204) and right-sided (n\u2009=\u2009382) IE. Descriptive statistics, Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used. The mean age of patients in the left-sided group was 46\u00a0years compared to 35\u00a0years in the right-sided group, p\u2009<\u20090.001. Left-sided IE had a higher proportion of females. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative pathogen in 48% of cases in the left-sided group compared to 88% in the right-sided group. Unadjusted and adjusted long-term survival was better in right-sided IE compared to left-sided IE. Independent predictors of long-term mortality were increasing age, end-stage renal disease, nosocomial infection, brain emboli and left-sided IE. Left-sided IE was common in people with IDU but the proportion of females with left-sided IE was low. S. aureus was twice as common in right-sided IE compared to left-sided IE, and the long-term prognosis of right sided IDU-associated IE was better compared to left-sided IE despite the fact that few were operated."
