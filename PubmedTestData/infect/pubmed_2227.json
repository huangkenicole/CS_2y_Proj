        "The effects of transplacental porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection on porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV)-induced enteritis were examined in neonatal piglets. Six pregnant sows were randomly allocated to an infected (n=3) or control group (n=3). Three pregnant sows were inoculated intranasally with 6 mL of tissue culture fluid containing 1.2 x 10(5) tissue culture infective doses 50% (TCID(50))/mL of PCV2 strain SNUVR000470 three weeks before the expected farrowing date. Three control pregnant sows were similarly exposed to uninfected cell culture supernatants. Thirty piglets from PCV2-infected sows were randomly assigned to two groups (A and B) of 15 piglets each. Another 30 piglets from noninfected sows were randomly assigned to two groups (C and D) of 15 piglets each. The piglets in groups A and C were dosed orally at three days of age with 2mL of virus stock (1 x 10(6.5) TCID(50)/mL) of the PEDV strain, SNUVR971496, at the third passage. The mean villous height and crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio in PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows (group A) were significantly different from those of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C) at 36, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) (P<0.05). In PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows (group A), significantly more PEDV nucleic acid was detected in the jejunal tissues (P<0.05) at 24 hpi than in the same tissues of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C). Thereafter, at 36, 48, 60, and 70 hpi significantly more PEDV nucleic acid (P<0.05) was detected in the jejunal tissues of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C) than those of the PEDV-infected piglets from the PCV2-infected sows (group A). It is concluded that the clinical course of PEDV disease was markedly affected by transplacental infection of PCV2."
