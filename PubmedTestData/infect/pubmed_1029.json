        "It was the aim to examine whether local application of antiseptic and antibiotic substances is an effective treatment of vascular graft infection.",
        "19 pigs with a bodyweight between 20 and 30 kg were assigned to three different groups. Group I: control (6), group II: local treatment with Sulmycin implant, group (6) III: local treatment with Taurolin (Taurolidine) (7). An unprotected vascular graft was inserted in the right femoral artery of all pigs. After finishing the proximal and distal anastomosis and prior to closure of the incision, the vascular grafts were contaminated locally with 2 x 10(7) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. Seven days later all animals received another unprotected vascular prosthesis with or without additional treatment according to groups I, II, III. 28 days after primary operation the animals were euthanized and the grafts harvested. The specimens were examined for signs of infection by histology and microbiology.",
        "After the primary operation all animals presented with infected vascular prosthesis. At termination of the trial on day 28 all grafts of group I were contaminated, 5 out of 6 grafts in group II, and 5 out of 7 in group III presented with infected grafts. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups. Infection could not be prevented by the antimicrobial agents used. The primary infecting organism Staphylococcus aureus, however, was eliminated in all cases.",
        "Both antimicrobial substances examined were not effective in the treatment of vascular graft infection, but might be used as adjuvant therapy of vascular graft infection, whereby Sulmycin implant seems to be more effective regarding the incorporation of the prosthesis."
