        "Viscerotropic virulence of the Asibi strain of yellow fever virus (YFV) for monkeys has been known to be lost after serial passage in HeLa cell monolayers. This phenomenon was investigated in several other mammalian and insect tissue cell lines. Assay in monkeys of original seed virus and of virus after 7 and 11 passages in a porcine kidney cell line (PK) indicated essentially equal infectivity and mortality. Moreover, monkeys receiving the passaged virus exhibited more rapid onset of disease and death than animals infected with original seed virus. Histological changes in animals inoculated with passaged virus were identical to those in animals receiving the seed virus. Virus from later passages in PK cells was also lethal for approximately 50% of the monkeys; however, evidence for progressive attenuation was seen in these preparations. Similar results were obtained with a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) cell line. In contrast to results obtained in PK and mosquito cells, YFV became essentially avirulent (nonlethal and less infective) for monkeys after only seven passages in HeLa cell cultures."
