        "Host-parasite relationship and liver damage were studied in experimental schistosomiasis in albino mice utilizing <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> of Northern and Southern Sudan. Mice were infected with single doses of 180 cercariae of either <i>S. mansoni</i> \u201cNorth\u201d or <i>S. mansoni</i> \u201cSouth\u201d. There was some evidence of both early prepatency and liver damage, a high percentage of both cercarial penetration and worm recovery in mice infected with <i>S. mansoni</i> \u201cSouth\u201d. A new strain of <i>Biomphalaria sudanica</i> snails were found to be resistant to infection with <i>S. mansoni</i> of both Northern and Southern Sudan. <i>B. pfeifferi</i> snails were susceptible to both <i>S. mansoni</i> \u201cNorth\u201d and \u201cSouth\u201d: differences in susceptibility were found to vary with the age of snails, the younger being more susceptible. Infectivity and mortality were higher in case of infection due to <i>S. mansoni</i> \u201cSouth\u201d."
