      "AbstractText": [
        "Specific-pathogen-free chickens orally inoculated at 4 days of age with a moderately pathogenic vaccine strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and/or at 5 days of age with Cryptosporidium baileyi oocysts remained free of overt clinical signs throughout a 16-day period postinoculation (PI). The prepatency period for C. baileyi oocyst shedding was shorter in chickens receiving higher numbers of oocysts, but once shedding was detected, there were no obvious differences in shedding patterns among groups receiving 10(3) through 10(6) oocysts. On days 8 and 16 PI, cryptosporidia were located primarily in the bursae of Fabricius. IBDV exposure was associated with bursal follicle atrophy, whereas C. baileyi infection resulted in bursal epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, mild follicle atrophy, and heterophil infiltration of the bursal mucosa. Examination of experimental groups of 30 birds each indicated that concurrent infection with both agents resulted in more severe bursal lesions, more infected birds, and greater numbers of cryptosporidia in infected tissues. At the termination of the trial, 16 days PI, Cryptosporidium infection was associated with a 6% decrease in mean body weight compared with controls."
