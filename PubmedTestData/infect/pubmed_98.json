        "Nonenveloped gastrointestinal viruses, such as human rotavirus, can exit infected cells from the apical surface without cell lysis. The mechanism of such nonlytic exit is poorly understood. The nonenveloped Orsay virus is an RNA virus infecting the intestine cells of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Dye staining results suggested that Orsay virus exits from the intestine of infected worms in a nonlytic manner. Therefore, the Orsay virus-<i>C. elegans</i> system provides an excellent <i>in vivo</i> model to study viral exit. The Orsay virus genome encodes three proteins: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, capsid protein (CP), and a nonstructural protein, \u03b4. \u03b4 can also be expressed as a structural CP-\u03b4 fusion. We generated an ATG-to-CTG mutant virus that had a normal CP-\u03b4 fusion but could not produce free \u03b4 due to the lack of the start codon. This mutant virus showed a viral exit defect without obvious phenotypes in other steps of viral infection, suggesting that \u03b4 is involved in viral exit. Ectopically expressed free \u03b4 localized near the apical membrane of intestine cells in <i>C. elegans</i> and colocalized with ACT-5, an intestine-specific actin that is a component of the terminal web. Orsay virus infection rearranged ACT-5 apical localization. Reduction of the ACT-5 level via RNA interference (RNAi) significantly exacerbated the viral exit defect of the \u03b4 mutant virus, suggesting that \u03b4 and ACT-5 functionally interact to promote Orsay virus exit. Together, these data support a model in which the viral \u03b4 protein interacts with the actin network at the apical side of host intestine cells to mediate the polarized, nonlytic egress of Orsay virus.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> An important step of the viral life cycle is how viruses exit from host cells to spread to other cells. Certain nonenveloped viruses can exit cultured cells in nonlytic ways; however, such nonlytic exit has not been demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> In addition, it is not clear how such nonlytic exit is achieved mechanistically <i>in vivo</i> Orsay virus is a nonenveloped RNA virus that infects the intestine cells of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> It is currently the only virus known to naturally infect <i>C. elegans</i> Using this <i>in vivo</i> model, we show that the \u03b4 protein encoded by Orsay virus facilitates the nonlytic exit of the virus, possibly by interacting with host actin on the apical side of worm intestine cells."
