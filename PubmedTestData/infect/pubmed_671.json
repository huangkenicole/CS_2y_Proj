        "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that infects nearly all humans by adulthood and is associated with a spectrum of human diseases including Infectious Mononucleosis, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, and lymphomas in immunosuppressed hosts. Nonhuman primate (NHP) animal models provide important experimental systems for studying EBV infection. There has been significant progress in studies of EBV-related herpesviruses, or lymphocryptoviruses (LCV), that naturally infect New and Old World NHPs. Prototypes for New and Old World LCV have been cloned and sequenced, humoral and cellular immune responses to LCV in NHP have been characterized, experimental LCV infections in na\u00efve rhesus macaques have been successful, and a genetic system to manipulate specific viral genes in rhesus LCV (rhLCV) has been developed. These advances have led to new insights in the dynamic interactions with the host during acute and persistent EBV infection and can provide a novel platform for EBV vaccine development. Further development and utilization of the rhLCV animal model would be greatly enhanced by expansion of LCV-free breeding colonies as a reliable source of na\u00efve animals for experimental studies. NHP animal models for EBV infection provide unique opportunities for understanding the biology of EBV infection in humans and translating that knowledge into effective vaccines against EBV-induced diseases."
