        "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects and can persist in a majority of people worldwide. Within an infected host, EBV targets two major cell types, B cells and epithelial cells, and viruses emerging from one cell type preferentially infect the other. We use mathematical models to understand why EBV infects epithelial cells when B cells serve as a stable refuge for the virus and how switching between infecting each cell type affects virus persistence and shedding. We propose a mathematical model to describe the regulation of EBV infection within a host. This model is used to study the effects of parameter values on optimal viral strategies for transmission, persistence, and intrahost competition. Most often, the optimal strategy to maximize transmission is for viruses to infect epithelial cells, but the optimal strategy for maximizing intrahost competition is for viruses to mainly infect B cells. Applying the results of the within-host model, we derive a model of EBV dynamics in a homogeneous population of hosts that includes superinfection. We use this model to study the conditions necessary for invasion and coexistence of various viral strategies at the population level. When the importance of intrahost competition is weak, we show that coexistence of different strategies is possible."
