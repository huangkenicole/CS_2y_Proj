        "The pathogenicity of caprine herpesvirus type-1 (CHV-1) in goat kids and lambs was studied. Two experiments were carried out. In the first, two Saanen goat kids and four lambs of a local breed were infected intravenously with the Swiss strain E/CH of the virus. Clinical reaction was severe in the kids, but it was very mild in the lambs. Virus was excreted from the kids in higher titres and longer than in lambs. Virus was also isolated from tissue specimens but only from a kid that died on post inoculation day 4 (PID 4). The gross- and histopathological lesions were more severe in kids. In the second experiment only lambs were used. They were dexamethasone treated and then virus inoculated. A very mild infection developed. The lambs did not shed the virus, neither the virus was isolated from their tissues collected at necropsy. Nevertheless histopathological lesions were seen. In both experiments the animals seroconverted on PID 10."
