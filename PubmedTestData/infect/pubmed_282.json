        "An assay method for the infectivity of Hantaan virus, a causative agent of HFRS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome), was developed by the use of IFA (immunofluorescent antibody technique). With the aid of this method, the growth characteristics of Hantaan virus, 76-118 strain, were followed in A549 cells. At a maximal MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 1.6 VAIU (viral antigen-inducing units) per cell, the conventionally available value, plateau level potencies of the viral antigen and virus infectivity were attained at eight and ten days postinfection, respectively, and most of the infective virus produced accumulated in the culture fluids of infected cells. When infections were defined with MOI values in terms of VAIU per cell, development of the viral antigen was highly consistent and followed a given pattern of kinetics. Based on these findings, a protocol for preparation of the viral antigen in IFA was presented, wherein spot culture and FBS treatment were emphasized as effective procedures to minimize non-specific staining."
