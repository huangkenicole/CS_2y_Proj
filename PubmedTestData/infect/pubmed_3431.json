        "Arthritis in rabbits was caused after experimental oral infection with Yersinia enterocolitica (serotype 0:3, biotype 4, pYV+). Clinical and laboratory signs, bacterial dissemination to the viscera, immune response and morphological findings were studied from day 1 to day 40 post-infection (p.i.). Augmentation of body temperature and erythrocyte sedimentation rate occurred on day 1, and on day 8 p.i. was accompanied by leucopenia. The number of alveolar macrophages was increased up to the 15th day p.i., in contrast to peritoneal macrophage numbers. Extensive bacterial colonization of the internal organs was detected at necropsy until the end of the experiment. Analysis of the cell immune response revealed activation of B cells in peripheral blood, spleen and thymus as well as augmentation of T-cell number in the lymphoid organs examined on days 15, 28 and 40 p.i. Histological changes typical of a generalized infection, such as purulent meningoencephalitis, catarrhal pneumonia and lymphadenitis, were observed. Clinical and morphological manifestations of arthritis were also established. The results obtained show that Y. enterocolitica (serotype 0:3, pYV+) induces a generalized, non-lethal infection in Chinchilla rabbits, complicated by arthritis."
