        "An inbred strain of the southern platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, was used as a host for Aeromonas hydrophila and Yersinia ruckeri infections. The infections were initiated by holding the platyfish in inoculation baths containing dilutions of virulent A. hydrophila or Y. ruckeri strains. Inoculating the platyfish in this manner resulted in a dose-dependent mortality over a range of bacterial input from 10(5) to 10(8) A. hydrophila and 10(6) to 10(8) Y. ruckeri/ml. Clinical manifestations of A. hydrophila infections were noted in infected platyfish that eventually died, but not in platyfish that survived. In this model, the Y. ruckeri infected fish died before obvious signs of infection were detected. The A. hydrophila strain used to establish the infections was recovered from the kidney and intestine of infected fish that died, but not from survivors receiving the same inoculation dose. Both infective bacteria were tested for the ability to invade a number of different fish and human cultured cells. A hydrophila strain TF7 did not invade of the cells tested, whereas the Y. ruckeri strain invaded fish derived cultured cells, but not human derived Hep-2 cells."
