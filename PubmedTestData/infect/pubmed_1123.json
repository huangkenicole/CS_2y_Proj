      "AbstractText": [
        "An experimental study was carried out in neonatal goat kids to examine the infectivity of Cryptosporidium oocysts, pattern of oocyst shedding and morphological changes in the intestine during the infection. Cryptosporidium oocysts isolated from adult asymptomatic goats, and identified as C. parvum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used in this study. Of three 4-day-old goat kids, two were orally infected with C. parvum oocysts (10(5) oocysts in 10 ml PBS/kid). One goat kid given 10 ml PBS only by the oral route served as a control. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the faeces of one infected kid on day 3 post-inoculation (pi) whereas in the other 6 days pi. The faecal oocyst counts gradually increased and the peak counts in the two kids were 2 x 10(6)g(-1) (on day 12 pi) and 3.2 x 10(6)g(-1) (on day 14 pi). The increase in faecal oocyst output coincided with diarrhoea in an infected kid from days 10-17 pi. Although the oocyst excretion declined gradually after the peak, both infected kids excreted oocysts until euthanized on days 20 and 22 pi. Light and scanning electron microscopic investigations of the ileum revealed the endogenous stages on the brush border of the enterocytes, infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the lamina propria, atrophy, stunting and fusion of villi. For purposes of comparison, goat Cryptosporidium oocysts were inoculated orally (10(3) oocysts/mouse) to eight, 1-week-old mice. All experimental mice excreted oocysts from day 3 pi, and four infected mice continued to excrete oocysts up to day 42 pi. The experimental infection described in goat kids resembled the natural disease in terms of oocyst excretion, clinical signs and intestinal pathology. The ability of oocysts excreted by asymptomatic goats, to infect goat kids and mice is likely to have a major impact on the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in livestock and man."
