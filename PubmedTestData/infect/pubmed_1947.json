        "Female patients with symptoms of urinary tract infection (n = 1136) were studied in primary health care with respect to (a) clinical symptoms as predictors of bacteriuria; (b) relation between aetiological agent and clinical picture, especially for P-fimbriated Escherichia coli; and (c) clinical findings in cases with 10(2)- less than 10(5) CFU/ml of E. coli. Prevalence of bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/ml) was 61%. Concurrence of urgency/frequency and dysuria, short duration of symptoms and hematuria increased the probability of bacteriuria and were also significantly more frequent among cases with low counts of E. coli (10(2) less than 10(5) CFU/ml in pure culture or mixed flora) than among cases with sterile urine, indicating an aetiological role of E. coli in many of those cases. Infections with P-fimbriated E. coli were as benign as the P-fimbriae-negative. The rate of P-fimbriation was 29% in specimens containing greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/ml of E. coli, 30% among specimens with less than 10(5) CFU/ml in pure culture and 10% in specimens containing less than 10(5) CFU/ml of E. coli in mixed culture. Patients infected with Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Proteus did not show a higher rate of previous urinary tract disease or anomalies."
