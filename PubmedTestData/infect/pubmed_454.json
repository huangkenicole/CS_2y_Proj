        "The discovery of Trichinella species infecting poikilotherm vertebrates has opened new possibilities in the epidemiology of this parasite group. The aim of the present work was to investigate the infectivity of the two non-encapsulated species of Trichinella infecting both mammals and reptiles, Trichinella papuae and Trichinella zimbabwensis, for equatorial freshwater carnivore fishes. To this end, two species of piranhas, four Serrasalmus nattereri and four Serrasalmus rhombeus, were each inoculated per os with the two species of Trichinella larvae. Six days post infection (p.i.), one fish of each species inoculated with one of the two species of Trichinella was sacrificed. The intestines and celomatic cavities were searched for worms using dissection microscopy, and the presence of muscle larvae was evaluated by artificial digestion. The other 4 inoculated fish were sacrificed 60 days p.i. and similarly searched for the presence of worms. No larva or adult worms were detected in any organ or tissue at 6 or 60 days p.i. The lack of infectivity of T. papuae and T. zimbabwensis for fish suggests that the entozoic habitat of this animal does not represent a suitable environment for these two Trichinella species. More importantly, these data indicate that freshwater fishes, one of the food resources for crocodiles, caimans and alligators, are unlikely to play a role in the epidemiology of the known species of the genus Trichinella."
