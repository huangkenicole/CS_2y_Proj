      "AbstractText": [
        "Elizabethkingia anophelis is an opportunistic pathogen that infects newborns and immunocompromised patients. Because the infection is associated with high mortality as a result of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, alternative treatment methods are needed. Our previous study successfully isolated the world's first E. anophelis phage, TCUEAP1, which showed beneficial protection to E. anophelis-infected mice. More new bacteriophages are needed in order to provide sufficient choices to combat E. anophelis infections.",
        "In the current study, two new phages infecting E. anophelis were isolated from wastewater and were designated as TCUEAP2 and TCUEAP3. Further experiments, namely, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infection assay, host-range analysis, and sequencing were performed to determine their biological and genomic characteristics.",
        "TEM analysis revealed that both TCUEAP2 and TCUEAP3 possess an icosahedral head with a non-contractile tail, and belong to the Siphoviridae family. Further experiments revealed that TCUEAP3 has a longer latent period and higher burst size compared to TCUEAP2. Host range analysis showed that both TCUEAP2 and TCUEAP3 have a narrow host range, infecting only their respective hosts. The genomic size of phage TCUEAP2 was 42,403\u00a0bps containing 61 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), whereas the genome size of TCUEAP3 was 37,073\u00a0bps containing 40 predicted ORFs.",
        "Due to the distinct biological characteristics of TCUEAP2 and TCUEAP3, they may be satisfactory for clinical uses such as preparation of phage cocktails or decontamination in clinical settings."
