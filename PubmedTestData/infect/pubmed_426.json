      "AbstractText": [
        "The infectivity, dissemination, and transmissibility of wild-type Sindbis (SIN) virus were studied in Aedes aegypti (L). There was an initial decline in the viral titer of whole mosquitoes for 3 d after ingestion of virus, followed by a gradual increase to a maximal level by day 6. Immunoperoxidase staining of Ae. aegypti for viral antigen showed infection of midgut epithelial cells on day 1, of the fat body by day 3, and of the brain by day 4. By day 5, there was infection of the foregut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, ovariole sheaths, Johnston's organ, thoracic ganglia, ventral nerve cord, and salivary glands. Viral antigen was not detected in the flight muscles and was found only in ovariole sheaths of the ovaries; germinal tissue was not infected. The transmission rate from SIN-infected Ae. aegypti to neonatal mice was 40%. A comparison of Ae. aegypti infected with SIN and with a neuroadapted strain of Sindbis virus (NSIN), which is more neurovirulent than SIN to mice after intracerebral inoculation, did not reveal significant differences in infectivity, dissemination, or transmissibility. The important differences between SIN and NSIN in a mouse model were not reflected in the infection of Ae. aegypti by the oral route."
