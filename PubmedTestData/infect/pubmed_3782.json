      "AbstractText": [
        "The pathogenic potential of Acanthamoeba strains was evaluated by experimental infection of murine AIDS (MAIDS) model. C57BL/6 mice were induced to immunocompromized state by intraperitoneal injection of LP-BM5 MuLV and revealed the typical splenomegaly and lymphatic enlargement of axillar and inguinal regions on necropsy 4 weeks after viral infection. Although there was no significant difference in the mortality rate of MAIDS mouse according to the culture temperature, it was very different in the mortality rate from strain to strain of Acanthamoeba. A. healyi OC-3A strain isolated from the brain of a GAE patient showed the highest mortality rate and A. culbertsoni A-1 strain from tissue culture was the second. KA/S3 and KA/S2 strains isolated from soil revealed very low virulence. The mice infected by intranasal inoculation of Acanthamoeba showed relatively chronic course than intravenous inoculation. The gross findings of lungs and brains from infected mice were variable among mice. On the microscopic observations, the lungs showed much more severe inflammation and necrosis than the brains microscopically. This MAIDS model would be useful to study the opportunistic protozoan infections of AIDS patients. In the light of these results, the pathogenic potential and the virulence of Acanthamoeba may be determined genetically."
