        "Whether or not the efficacy of antimicrobial agents in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in men and women can be evaluated with the same protocol was studied in a total of 416 male and 387 female patients. Clinical and bacteriological efficacies achieved in male patients were significantly lower than those achieved in female patients. The most important reason for the difference in clinical and bacteriological efficacies was due to the difference of infecting organisms between male and female patients. It was concluded that complicated UTI in men and women can alternatively be studied with the same protocol in so far as the results were stratified according to sex and infecting organism."
