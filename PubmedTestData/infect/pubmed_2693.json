        "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is widespread throughout Chinese farms, and the infection rate of porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV) is very high. The emergence of mixed infection involving PCV2 and PRV has been difficult to prevent and control and has caused considerable economic loss. The present study investigated lung and brain damage caused by PRV in piglets with PCV2 infection. Twenty piglets were divided randomly into two experiment groups (PRV group and PRV\u202f+\u202fPCV2 group; n\u202f=\u202f10 per group). The pigs were observed for clinical signs at specified times. At necropsy, lung and brain tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination, and tissue virus load was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Severe pathogenicity due to PRV was evident in two-month-old piglets. PCV2 and PRV co-infection led to more severe neurological and respiratory symptoms and a higher mortality rate in the piglets. In addition, the pathological damage to the lung and brain was also aggravated. The co-infection was associated with a significant increase in the content of PRV in the brain and lung tissue. In conclusion, PCV2 and PRV co-infection could cause severe and irreversible damage to piglets."
