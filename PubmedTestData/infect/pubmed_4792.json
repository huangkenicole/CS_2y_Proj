        "Pneumonic pasteurellosis has been reproduced in conventional, weaned, Friesian-cross calves using a strain of Pasteurella haemolytica biotype A, serotype 1 (P haemolytica A1) isolated from a pathologically confirmed incident of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. The major clinical findings were pyrexia, hyperpnoea, tachypnoea, nasal discharge and reduced appetite. Fibrinous pneumonia was present in the lungs of animals at necropsy on days 2 and 3 after initial infection while by days 9 and 10 after initial infection many of the areas of fibrinous pneumonia were confined by a fibrous capsule forming well defined nodules. During the experiment natural transmission of the infecting strain of P haemolytica A1 occurred in two control calves which developed a condition identical to that in the artificially infected calves. P haemolytica A1 was repeatedly recovered from the nasopharynx of infected calves and at necropsy throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Seroconversion, as measured by indirect haemagglutination, to the organism developed in all infected calves by days 9 and 10 after initial infection. The clinical, microbiological and pathological findings were identical to those seen in field incidents of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis involving recently housed, weaned, single-suckled calves."
