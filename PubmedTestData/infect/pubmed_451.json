        "At a conference held in McLean, VA in November 1996, challenges and hopes for developing new HIV therapeutic strategies were discussed. Approaches to designing new therapies focused on blocking HIV replication and infectivity, and enhancing the body's immune response against HIV. A possible gene therapy using genetically-modified immune cells that express high levels of receptors for HIV antigens and recognition of the antigen by these receptors to evoke efficient T-cell responses. Novel anti-HIV vaccines might cause the immune system to not only respond to the antigens from the virus initially infecting the body, but also to the mutant forms of HIV that develop. Hematopoietic stem cells transduced with genes that inhibit HIV replication could potentially reconstitute the immune system in HIV-infected patients. The stem cells are self-renewing, so this type of treatment would lead to long-lived reconstitution. Unfortunately, the appropriate type of stem cell is rare and requires certain cellular functions that occur in the thymus to differentiate them into CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Other hopeful treatments may involve using antioxidants to block inflammatory and oxidative stress that are negatively correlated with survival in HIV-infected patients."
