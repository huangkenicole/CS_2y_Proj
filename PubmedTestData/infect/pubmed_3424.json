        "We studied the biochemical properties of the urease of Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the possible role of the urease in experimental urinary tract infections. For this purpose, the nonhemagglutinating and nonadherent strain 9325, which was isolated from a case of symptomatic urinary tract infection, was used. The urease was shown to have a Km of 6.64 mM urea and a Vmax of 4.59 mumol NH3.min-1.mg-1. The enzyme was inhibited by acetohydroxamic acid in a noncompetitive manner. By means of Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography, we determined a mean molecular weight (+/- standard error of the mean) of 420,000 +/- 16,000. To assess the contribution of S. saprophyticus urease to uropathogenicity, a urease-negative mutant was constructed by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. In the rat model of ascending unobstructed urinary tract infection, higher numbers of CFU.gram of tissue-1 and more-severe lesions were detected with the parent strain. Moreover, bladder stones were found in animals infected with the urease-positive strain only. Interestingly, the difference in mean bacterial counts of the bladders was found to be significant by the Wilcoxon two-sample test (P less than 0.05), whereas that between the kidney bacterial counts was not. Immunoblot studies revealed a faint antibody response in rats infected with the mutant strain, although bacteria could still be detected in the kidneys after 7 days. Sera of animals challenged with the parent strain reacted strongly with many antigens of S. saprophyticus. Our data indicate that urease is a major factor for invasiveness of S. saprophyticus, especially in the tissue of the bladder, whereas persistence in the urinary tract and nephropathogenicity of this organism are governed by factors other than urease."
