        "Cryptosporidium spp. are protozoans that cause diarrheal illness in humans and animals, including birds, worldwide. The present study was aimed to revisit the infectivity and pathogenicity of C. avium, recently considered to be a valid avian-infecting species of Cryptosporidium, and foster further understanding of its biological characteristics.",
        "Results showed that no Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the feces of experimentally inoculated BALB/c mice, Mongolian gerbils, quail or budgerigars within 30 days post-infection (dpi). Oocysts were first detected in feces of 3-day-old and 40-day-old hens at 8 and 9 dpi, respectively. In ducks infected with C. avium, oocysts were first detected at 9 dpi. Oocysts of infected animals were studied using a nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for the SSU rRNA gene, actin gene, HSP70 gene and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene (COWP) detection. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), using SspI and VspI restriction enzymes, was carried out to genotype the species and obtained amplification products were sequenced. Cryptosporidium developmental stages were found in the longitudinal plica of the bursa fabricii (BF) of hens, with high levels observed in histological sections and scanning electron microscopy. No pathological changes were observed.",
        "These findings indicate that the bursa fabricii may be the primary site of C. avium infection. More biological data are needed to support the establishment of new species and contribute to the taxonomy of Cryptosporidium."
