        "Food-borne infections with <i>Salmonella</i> are among the most common causes of human diseases worldwide, and infections with the serovar Infantis are becoming increasingly important. So far, diverse phenotypes and genotypes of <i>S</i>. Infantis have been reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the infection dynamics of two different <i>S</i>. Infantis strains in broilers. For this purpose, 15 birds were infected on day 2 of life with 10<sup>8</sup>\u2005CFU/ml of a pESI+ or a pESI- <i>S</i>. Infantis strain, respectively. Ten uninfected birds served as in-contact birds to monitor transmission. In both groups, an increase of infection was observed from 7 days of age onwards, reaching its peak at 28 days. However, the pESI+ strain proved significantly more virulent being re-isolated from most cloacal swabs and organs by direct plating. In contrast, the pESI- strain could be re-isolated from cloacal swabs and caeca only when enrichment was applied. Although the excretion of this strain was limited, the transmission level to in-contact birds was similar to the pESI+ strain. Differences in infection dynamics were also reflected in the antibody response: whereas the pESI+ strain provoked a significant increase in antibodies, antibody levels following infection with the pESI- strain remained in the range of negative control birds. The actual findings provide for the first time evidence of <i>S</i>. Infantis strain-specific infectivity in broilers and confirm previous observations in the field regarding differences in persistence on farms and resistance against disinfectants."
