        "The protective immune response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) against the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, targeting host skin, fins and gills, comprises an accelerated and manifold elevated immunoglobulin gene expression as well as a significantly elevated number of neutrophils at infected sites. Experimental fish were subjected to a primary I. multifiliis infection followed by a series of secondary exposures before they were challenged by a high dosage of infective theronts. Immunized fish responded immediately with a protective response suggesting existence of immunological memory whereas fish exposed to the parasite for the first time obtained a marked infection. The primary response to infection was dominated by expression of genes encoding acute phase reactants and inflammatory cytokines as well as recruitment of neutrophils at infected locations. Immunized fish showed a significantly upregulated immunoglobulin gene expression following challenge, which indicates existence of a secondary response effected by antibodies. Both responses induced a significantly elevated expression of the Th2 signature cytokine Il13. The increased presence of neutrophils in immunized fish suggests that innate cell mediated immunity supplements or influence the protective response against the parasite."
