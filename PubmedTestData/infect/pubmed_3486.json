        "Experience with exposure to, or infection with pathogenic agents at the National Animal Disease Center is summarized. A total of 60 laboratory-associated exposures to infectious disease agents were reported. Forty-nine exposures resulted from known accidents, but the other 11 were identified only after the development of clinical or serological manifestations of infection. Eighteen cases of laboratory-acquired infections were reviewed. Brucellosis, the most frequently reported laboratory-acquired infection, accounted for one-half of the cases summarized. Three cases of leptospirosis, two cases of Newcastle disease, two cases of ringworm, and a single infection with Mycobacterium bovis and with Salmonella arizonae were also encountered. The most frequently reported causes of exposure were: auto-inoculation or spray exposure associated with the use of the hypodermic syringe, cuts or lacerations, direct contact with infected animals, and mouth pipetting. Although the infecting event could not be identified in 11 infections, presumptive evidence suggests aerogenic transmission as a probable route of exposure in a number of such cases."
