        "To study the pathogenicity of hepatitis G virus (HGV) and observe the genesis and pathological process of hepatitis G.",
        "HGV-RNA in serum was detected by RT-PCR assay. The immunohistochemical assays of liver tissue were performed with HGV monocoloned antibody (McAb) expressed from the region of HGV NS5 nucleic acid sequence. The clinical and pathological data of 52 patients with hepatitis G were discussed. In animal experiment, the Chinese Rhesus monkeys were infected with the serum of a patient with HGV infection. And the dynamic changes in serology and liver histology of animals were observed.",
        "One hundred and fifty-four patients with HGV-RNA positive were selected from 1552 patients with various kinds of hepatitis. Of 154 patients with HGV infection, 52 were infected with HGV only, which accounted for 33.8 (52/154) and 102 with positive HGV-RNA were super-infected with other hepatitis viruses, which accounted for 66.2 (102/154). The clinical and pathological observation showed that the acute and chronic hepatitis could be induced by HGV. The slight abnormality of transaminases ALT and AST in serum of monkeys lasted nearly 12 months and histological results showed a series of pathological changes.",
