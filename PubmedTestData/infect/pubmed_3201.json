      "AbstractText": [
        "The pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. Seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 Teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. A total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Streptococcus mitis. Five strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. The infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. None of the Prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains in combination with A. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with S. mitis in 42-100%. No difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup I (P. intermedia) and serogroup II and III (P. nigrescens). The infectivity of P. intermedia or P. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. P. intermedia and P. nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in rabbits."
