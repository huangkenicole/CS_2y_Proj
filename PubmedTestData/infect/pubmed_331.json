        "Gnathostoma, primarily an animal nematode, can infect human by the third stage larva by consumption of undercooked or raw fish, poultry, or pork. In Bangladesh gnathostomiasis is a very rare condition. The first case, an ocular infection by gnathostoma was reported in 2001 from Rangpur, a northern district. This is the second case report of gnathostomiasis which also is an ocular infection, occurred in an area of greater district of Rangpur.
