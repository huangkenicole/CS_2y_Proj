        "Following intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation of neonatal mice, the polytropic recombinant murine leukemia virus (MuLV), Fr98, induces a severe brain disease characterized by ataxia, seizures and death. In contrast, no apparent clinical neurological disease is seen after IP infection with Fr54, a polytropic MuLV differing from Fr98 in its envelope gene sequences. In the brain both Fr98 and Fr54 infect primarily capillary endothelial cells and microglia. However, the level of microglial infection by Fr98 is twofold higher than by Fr54, which might account for the difference in neurovirulence. In the present study, in order to test directly whether an increase in the number of microglia infected by Fr54 would be sufficient to induce clinical disease, we attempted to increase the level of Fr54 in the brain by changing the route of infection. After intraventricular inoculation with Fr54-infected neural stem cells (clone C17.2), a well-established vehicle for delivery of viruses and genes to the brain, mice became ataxic and died 4 weeks postinfection. In these mice induction of brain disease was correlated with a higher level of viral antigen in the cerebrum and an increase in the number of infected microglial cells in all brain regions examined compared with mice inoculated IP. In contrast, mice inoculated with neural stem cells infected with an ecotropic nonneurovirulent murine leukemia virus, FB29, developed no clinical disease in spite of evidence for widespread infection of microglia in brain. Since the main differences between Fr54 and FB29 are in the SU (gp70) region of the envelope gene, this region is most likely to account for the differences in induction of CNS disease seen in the current experiments."
