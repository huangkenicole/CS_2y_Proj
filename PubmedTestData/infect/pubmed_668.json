        "This is the first report of Salmonella senftenberg serovar outbreak in a burns unit. This unit admits about 2000 patients with major burn injuries annually. Routine sampling from wound swabs in December 1995 revealed S. senftenberg in a few samples following which a study was instituted from January to March 1996. Of 446 burn admissions during this period 80 patients were culture positive for S. senftenberg in wound swabs. The protocol for investigation included wound swabs on admission and then at biweekly interval, blood culture studies on clinically toxic patients, anti-microbial sensitivity studies, environmental sampling and hand swabs and stool cultures from about 50 staff members of the burns ward. No wound swab at the time of admission was positive for S. senftenberg. Environmental study and the study of staff members did not reveal any obvious source of the infection. S. senftenberg strains were sensitive to more than seven of the 11 anti-microbials tested at the beginning of the study but later 96.3% of the strains showed multidrug (more than three drugs) resistance. By April 1996 the isolates became negligible and later disappeared completely. The organism resurfaced again in March 1997 and the same study was instituted again on 413 admissions between March and May 1997. Fifty patients were culture positive for S. senftenberg. This time stool sample from one burn dresser tested positive for S. senftenberg. Interestingly, again at the beginning of the second outbreak the Salmonella strains were sensitive to 9 out of 11 anti-microbials tested, but later 96.11% strains became multidrug resistant. S. senftenberg strains showed maximum resistance to amoxycillin (97.5%) and minimum to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole (12%). It was noticed that Salmonella strains surfaced in wound swabs after 3-4 weeks of hospital stay. Forty-five out of 130 patients studied, in both the episodes, died due to septicemia. The majority of the patients who died had sustained > 60% TBSA burns. Blood cultures were done in 34/130 patients and eight yielded growth (2 S. senftenberg, 4 Klebsiella spp., and two Pseudomonas spp.)"
