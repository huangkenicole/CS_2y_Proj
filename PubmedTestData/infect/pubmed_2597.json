        "Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disease, abortion and myeloencephalopathy in horses. As with other herpesviruses, cell-mediated immunity is considered important for both recovery and protection. Although virus-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity can be detected following in vivo infection, little is known about the role of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) in these processes. Peripheral blood DCs were shown to express the viral glycoprotein gB perinuclearly following exposure to EHV-1 in vitro, demonstrating EHV-1 replication within them. Co-culture of infected DCs or their supernatants with a susceptible cell line (RK13) demonstrated that EHV-1 infection was productive. In vitro-infected DCs showed cytopathic effects, including loss of viability and syncytial formation. However, they were superior to other antigen presenting cells in stimulating both peripheral blood T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Although ponies which had been intranasally infected with EHV-1 exhibited T-cell proliferation to live virus presented on DCs, the responses began to decline as early as 15 weeks and cease at 22 weeks post-in vivo infection. Cytotoxic responses were not detected 35 weeks after the first intranasal infection but were seen again 7 weeks following a second infection. These findings show that equine DCs, which are infected with EHV-1 in vitro, can stimulate memory T-cell responses but appear unable to circumvent the short-lived memory response found following this infection in vivo."
