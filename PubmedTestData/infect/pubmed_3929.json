        "Phage therapy against bacterial pathogens has been resurrected as an alternative and supplementary anti-infective modality. Here, we observed that bacterial group motilities were impaired in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 lysogens for some temperate siphophages; the PA14 lysogens for DMS3 and MP22 were impaired in swarming motility, whereas the PA14 lysogen for D3112 was impaired in twitching motility. The swarming and twitching motilities of PA14 were also affected in the presence of MP22 and D3112, respectively. The in vitro killing activities of D3112 and MP22 toward PA14 did not differ, and neither did their in vivo persistence in the absence of bacterial infections in mice as well as in flies. Nevertheless, administration of D3112, not MP22, significantly reduced the mortality and the bacterial burdens in murine peritonitis-sepsis and Drosophila systemic infection caused by PA14. Taken together, we suggest that a temperate phage-mediated twitching motility inhibition might be comparably effective to control the acute infections caused by P. aeruginosa."
