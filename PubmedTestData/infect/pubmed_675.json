        "Cryptosporydium parvum is an intracellular parasite that infects gastrointestinal epithelium and produces diarrhea that is self-limited in immunocompetent persons but potentially life-threatening in immunocompromised, especially those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). C. parvum enteric infection's incidence in a pediatric HIV/AIDS cohort, during a 6 years period, was studied. Clinical and immunologic characteristics of the dual infection were also recorded. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was started or continued by all the patients during follow-up. Azithromicyn was used as antiparasitic drug. Cryptosporidiosis incidence was 13.7%; 33 out 240 children showed chronic diarrhea lasting 14 days at least, or recurrent, without dehydration and electrolytic disturbance. Peripheral blood T CD4+ percentage levels of the patients were variable and without relationship with C. parvum presence. Viral load levels in 31 out 33 patients were over cut-off at the enteric episode time. Mild or moderate eosinophilia were recorded in 23% of the patients and other intestinal parasites were present in 11 children. When the number of enteric episodes were compared with the clinical and immunological patient's status, not significant differences were recorded. HAART is the best treatment to improve immune function in HIV patients avoiding potentially fatal complications that accompany acute diarrhea during concomitant infection with C. parvum."
