        "Picornaviruses infect a wide variety of cell types <i>in vitro</i>, with rapid replication kinetics and pronounced cytopathic effect. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) can also establish a persistent infection <i>in vivo</i> that can lead to pathology, including dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. One model system to study persistent infection is the pancreatic ductal cell line PANC-1, which CVB3 infects and is maintained indefinitely. We have characterized this model for CVB3 infection to study persistent infection for over 6 months. We find that CVB3 rapidly replicates within PANC-1 cells without robust cytopathic effect, and after 1 month in culture, titers stabilize. We find that infection does not significantly affect cellular viability. Persistent virus reverts to lytic infection when transferred to Huh7 or Vero cells. We find that persistent CVB3 adapts to PANC-1 cells via mutation of its capsid proteins and, curiously, the viral polymerase (3Dpol) to generate a high-fidelity polymerase. Persistent infection is associated with reduced cleavage of eIF4G, reduced plaque size, and decreasing particle infectivity. We further find that polyamine metabolism is altered in persistently infected cells, with the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) reduced in translation. We further find that targeting polyamine synthesis reduces persistent infection without affecting the viability of the PANC-1 cells. Finally, we find that viral fidelity is essential to maintaining CVB3 infection, and targeting viral fidelity reduces persistent virus infection. Together, these data highlight a novel role for polyamines and fidelity in persistent CVB3 infection and suggest avenues for therapeutic development to target persistent infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enteroviruses are significant human pathogens that can cause severe disease, including cardiomyopathies. Viruses like coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) can cause tissue damage by lytically infecting cells; however, CVB3 can also persistently infect, which has been associated with several pathologies. Studying persistent infection <i>in vitro</i> is challenging, as CVB3 lytically infects most cellular model systems. Here, we show that CVB3 establishes persistent infection in pancreatic ductal cells <i>in vitro</i>, similar to prior studies on other coxsackieviruses. We also show that this infection results in adaptation of the virus to these cells, as well as changes to cellular metabolism of polyamines."
