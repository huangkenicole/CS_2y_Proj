      "AbstractText": [
        "During passage through the human gastrointestinal tract, enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EHEC) is exposed to membrane-damaging bile in the small intestine. We previously reported that EHEC treatment with a physiological bile salt mixture upregulates <i>basRS</i>, encoding a two-component system, and <i>arnBCADTEF</i>, encoding the aminoarabinose lipid A modification pathway (J. V. Kus, A. Gebremedhin, V. Dang, S. L. Tran, A. Serbanescu, and D. Barnett Foster, J Bacteriol 193: 4509-4515, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00200-11). The present study examined the effect of bile salt mix (BSM) treatment on EHEC resistance to three human gastrointestinal defense peptides-HD-5, HNP-1, and LL-37-as well as the role of <i>basRS</i> and <i>arnT</i> in the respective responses. After BSM treatment, EHEC resistance to HD-5 and HNP-1 was significantly increased in a BSM-, defensin dose-dependent manner. The resistance phenotype was dependent on both <i>basRS</i> and <i>arnT</i> However, the BSM treatment did not alter EHEC resistance to LL-37, even when the <i>ompT</i> gene, encoding an LL-37 cleavage protease, was disrupted. Interestingly, enteropathogenic <i>E. coli</i>, a related pathogen that infects the small intestine, showed a similar BSM-induced resistance phenotype. Using a model of EHEC infection in <i>Galleria mellonella</i>, we found significantly lower survival rates in wax moth larvae infected with BSM-treated wild-type EHEC than in those infected with a BSM-treated <i>basS</i> mutant, suggesting that treatment with a physiological BSM enhances virulence through a <i>basS</i>-mediated pathway. The results of this investigation provide persuasive evidence that bile salts typically encountered during transit through the small intestine can serve as an environmental cue for EHEC, enhancing resistance to several key host defense peptides."
