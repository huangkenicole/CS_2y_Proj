      "AbstractText": [
        "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a well-adapted human virus, and its infection is exclusive to our species, generally beginning in the childhood and then persisting throughout the life of most of the affected adults. Although this infection generally remains asymptomatic, EBV can trigger life-threatening conditions under unclear circumstances. The EBV lifecycle is characterized by interactions with other viruses or bacteria, which increases the probability of awakening its pathobiont capacity. For instance, EBV infects B cells with the potential to alter the germinal center reaction (GCR)-an adaptive immune structure wherein mutagenic-driven processes take place. HIV- and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>-induced B cell hyperactivation also feeds the GCR. These agents, along with the B cell tropic KSHV, converge in the ontogeny of germinal center (GC) or post-GC lymphomas. EBV oral transmission facilitates interactions with local bacteria and HPV, thereby increasing the risk of periodontal diseases and head and neck carcinomas. It is less clear as to how EBV is localized in the stomach, but together with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, they are known to be responsible for gastric cancer. Perhaps this mechanism is reminiscent of the local inflammation that attracts different herpesviruses and enhances graft damage and chances of rejection in transplanted patients. In this review, we discussed the existing evidence suggestive of EBV possessing the potential to synergize or cooperate with these agents to trigger or worsen the disease."
