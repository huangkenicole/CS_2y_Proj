        "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) first infects hematopoietic cells, with the infected cells then acting to distribute the virus throughout the body. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family molecules recognize sialic acid-containing molecules on the same cell surface, called cis-ligands, or molecules on other cells or soluble agents, called trans-ligands. Among the Siglec family molecules, Siglec-4 and Siglec-7 mediate VZV infection through association with glycoprotein B (gB). As Siglec-7, but not Siglec-4, is expressed on hematopoietic cells such as monocytes, the regulatory mechanism by which Siglec-7 associates with gB is important to our understanding of VZV infection of blood cells. Here, we found that Siglec-7 is required for VZV to infect human primary monocytes. Furthermore, treatment of primary monocytes with sialidase enhanced both VZV gB binding to monocytes and VZV infectivity. Calcium influx in primary monocytes decreased the expression of Siglec-7 cis-ligands and increased VZV infectivity. These results demonstrate that the Siglec-7 cis-ligands present on primary monocytes play an important role in VZV infection through regulation of the interaction between gB and Siglec-7."
