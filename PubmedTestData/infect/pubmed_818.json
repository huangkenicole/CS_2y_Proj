      "AbstractText": [
        "Trichinella spiralis infection results in the transformation of muscle cells into a new, non-muscular cell called the nurse cell, and the nurse cell-muscle larva complex is finally created. To investigate whether T. spiralis infectivity is NBL age-dependent, five groups of synchronous newborn larvae (sNBL) were obtained at 1, 9, 24, 48, and 72 h of age and were inoculated into mice by intravenous injection into the retro-orbital venous plexus. When both \"young\" groups of sNBL (1 and 9 h old) were injected, the highest number of larvae were capable of infecting the muscle cells. The highest infectivity of 80.0 % was observed for 9-h-old sNBL. In older sNBL the infectivity gradually decreased; thus, for 72-h-old sNBL the lowest level - 0.1% - was detected. Therefore, an \"age limit\" for NBL infectivity in the present study was precisely determined."
