        "BALB/c mice, which are normally highly susceptible to growth of Leishmania mexicana parasites in vivo, can be vaccinated with avirulent temperature-sensitive mutants of L. mexicana so that challenge with virulent organisms results in markedly diminished growth of the latter. Parasites extracted from the lesions which do appear in these mice are able to produce active infection in secondary hosts, although the rate of progression of these lesions is slower than that seen with the original virulent cloned organism. Interestingly, when irradiated parasites from the secondary hosts are themselves used to vaccinate naive BALB/c mice, less protection is seen than when irradiated virulent organisms from the initial infecting clone are used. These data suggest that when infection does take place in mice vaccinated with avirulent clones of parasite, the organisms which develop in lesions in these animals are substantially modified from those present in the initial infecting inoculum."
