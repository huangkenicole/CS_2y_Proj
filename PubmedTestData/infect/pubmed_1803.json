        "Veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) were experimentally challenged with the fungus Chrysosporium anamorph of Nannizziopsis vriesii (CANV). Chameleons were exposed to conidia in their captive environment, or were inoculated by direct application of a conidial suspension inoculum on intact and on abraded skin. The CANV induced lesions in all experimental groups and was recovered from infected animals, fulfilling Koch's postulates and confirming that it may act as a primary fungal pathogen in this species of reptile. A breach in cutaneous integrity, as simulated by mild scarification, increased the risk of infection but was not required for the CANV to express pathogenicity. Initial hyphae proliferation occurred in the outer epidermal stratum corneum, with subsequent invasion of the deeper epidermal strata and dermis. A spectrum of lesions was observed ranging from liquefactive necrosis of the epidermis to granulomatous inflammation in the dermis. CANV dermatomycosis appears to be contagious and can readily spread within a reptile collection, either directly through contact with infective arthroconidia or indirectly via fomites. Dense tufts of arthroconidiating hyphae were demonstrated histologically on the skin surface of many animals that developed dermatomycosis, and these arthroconidia may act as infective propagules involved in the transfer of disease between reptiles."
