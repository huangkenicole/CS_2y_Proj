      "AbstractText": [
        "Members of the family <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, such as <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, are considered both serious and urgent public health threats. Biofilms formed by these health care-associated pathogens can lead to negative and costly health outcomes. The global spread of antibiotic resistance, coupled with increased tolerance to antimicrobial treatments in biofilm-associated bacteria, highlights the need for novel strategies to overcome treatment hurdles. Bacteriophages (phages), or viruses that infect bacteria, have reemerged as one such potential strategy. Virulent phages are capable of infecting and killing their bacterial hosts, in some cases producing depolymerases that are able to hydrolyze biofilms. Phage therapy does have its limitations, however, including potential narrow host ranges, development of bacterial resistance to infection, and the potential spread of phage-encoded virulence genes. That being said, advances in phage isolation, screening, and genome sequencing tools provide an upside in overcoming some of these limitations and open up the possibilities of using phages as effective biofilm control agents."
