        "Female mice infected at birth with 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses of polyoma virus were mated when at least 6 weeks old. Polyoma was not detected in any tissues of 27 female mice before mating except for trace amounts in the kidneys of 2 mice, but late in gestation polyoma virus could be found in the kidneys of 21 of 38 mice with titers of 10(3.7) to 10(6.2) 50% tissue culture infective doses per gram of kidney. The virus was not detected in the brain, salivary gland, lung, liver, spleen, ovaries, placenta, or fetuses during gestation. Nonpregnant females were injected with female sex hormones over a period of 17 days, and polyoma was then detected in kidneys of 4 of 18 mice. Treatment of cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts with either sexhormones or a glucocorticosteroid resulted in approximately a threefold increase in the rate of infection of cells with polyoma virus."
