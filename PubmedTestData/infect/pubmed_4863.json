        "Recent development of imaging tools has facilitated studies of pathogen infections in\u00a0vivo in real time. This trend can be exemplified by advances in bioluminescence imaging (BLI), an approach that helps to visualize dissemination of pathogens within the same animal over several time points. Here, we employ bacterial BLI for examining routes of entry and spread of Aeromonas salmonicida susbp. salmonicida in rainbow trout. A virulent Danish A.\u00a0salmonicida strain was tagged with pAKgfplux1, a dual-labelled plasmid vector containing the mutated gfpmut3a gene from Aequorea victoria and the luxCDABE genes from the bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. The resulting A.\u00a0salmonicida transformant exhibited growth properties and virulence identical to the wild-type A.\u00a0salmonicida, which made it suitable for an experimental infection, mimicking natural conditions. Fish were infected with pAKgfplux1 tagged A.\u00a0salmonicida via immersion bath. Colonization and subsequent tissue dissemination was followed over a 24-h period using the IVIS spectrum imaging workstation. Results suggest the pathogen's colonization sites are the dorsal and pectoral fin and the gills, followed by a progression through the internal organs and an ensuing exit via the anal opening. This study provides a tool for visualizing colonization of A.\u00a0salmonicida and other bacterial pathogens in fish."
