        "Equine coronavirus (ECoV) causes pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy, and sometimes diarrhoea. Infected horses excrete the virus in their faeces, and ECoV is also detected in nasal samples from febrile horses. However, details about ECoV infection sites in the intestinal and respiratory tracts are lacking. To identify the ECoV infection sites in the intestinal and respiratory tracts, we performed an experimental infection study and analysed intestinal and respiratory samples collected from four infected horses at 3, 5, 7, and 14\u00a0days post-inoculation (dpi) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Two horses became febrile, but the other two did not. None of the horses had diarrhoea or respiratory signs, and severe cases were not observed in this study. None of the horses showed obvious abnormalities in their intestinal or respiratory tracts. Real-time RT-PCR and ISH showed that ECoV RNA was present throughout the intestinal tract, and ECoV-positive cells were mainly detected on the surface of the intestine. In one horse showing viremia at 3 dpi, ECoV RNA was detected in the lung by real-time RT-PCR, but not by ISH. This suggests that the lung cells themselves were not infected with ECoV and that real-time RT-PCR detected viremia in the lung. The other three horses were positive for ECoV RNA in nasal swabs but were negative in the trachea and lung by real-time RT-PCR and ISH. This study suggests that ECoV broadly infects the intestinal tract and is less likely to infect the respiratory tract."
