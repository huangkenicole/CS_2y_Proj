        "The infectivity of a Theileria parva lawrencei stabilate, from a stock derived from an African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, was investigated. In the first experiment a buffalo and three cattle were inoculated with a stabilate from a stock passaged three times in cattle. All cattle developed fatal theilerial infections. Isolations from the buffalo by tick feeding and cell culture isolation showed that it was infected with T p lawrencei at the time of inoculation, but the second isolation made 19 days after inoculation behaved like T p parva in cattle, developing a high parasitosis, while the third isolation made three months later behaved like T p lawrencei with low parasitosis. It was concluded that two biological types of T parva could exist in a buffalo at one time, but it was not shown that the buffalo had become a carrier of T p lawrencei adapted to cattle. In the second experiment two buffaloes and three cattle were inoculated with T p lawrencei (Serengeti) stabilate which had been passaged six times through cattle and ticks. The two buffaloes had mild theilerial infections and developed serological titres in the indirect fluorescent antibody test, but the cattle had fatal infections. Tick and cell culture isolations of T parva were possible during the clinical reactions of the buffaloes, but no carrier state was demonstrated. Theileria-infected cell lines were established from the buffaloes and the cattle and were examined using monoclonal antibodies against T parva schizonts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
