      "AbstractText": [
        "A part of the life cycle of Proteocephalus neglectus La Rue, 1911, a parasite of trout, starting from release of eggs from mature parasites into water, to the early phase of development in the definitive host, was studied under experimental conditions. Special regard has been paid to development in the intermediate host, copepod Cyclops strenuus. Some oncospheres in eggs kept in water at 5 and 10 degrees C remained infective for 20-25 days. The percentage of infected copepods depended on the length of their contact with parasite eggs. Cestode larvae (cercoscoleces) were formed in the intermediate host on days 8-10 p.i. at the temperatures of 21-22 degrees C, on days 18-21 at 15 degrees C, on days 24-28 at 10 degrees C, and on days 59-65 at 6 degrees C. Most larvae, including infective cercoscoleces, were localized in the cephalothorax of the intermediate host, particularly in its first segment. This localization did not change during their development. The infectivity of cercoscoleces was verified by experimental infection of Salmo gairdneri fry. The development of the cestode in this definitive host was observed for 17 days after infection at 10 degrees C. The finding of P. neglectus cereoscoleces in fish of the families Cottidae and Cyprinidae on day 2 after experimental infection indicates that these larvae can survive for a short time in atypical fish hosts."
