        "HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) are a rare group among HIV-1-infected individuals who can naturally control viral replication for a prolonged period. Due to their heterogeneous nature, no universal mechanism could be attributed to the EC status; instead, several host and viral factors have been discussed as playing a role. In this study, we investigated the fecal metabolome and microbiome in a Swedish cohort of EC (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200914), treatment-naive viremic progressors (VP; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200916), and HIV-negative individuals (HC; <i>n</i>\u2009=\u200912). Fecal untargeted metabolomics was performed by four ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Molecular docking and biochemical microscale thermophoresis (MST) were used to describe the peptide-metabolite interactions. Single-cycle infectivity assays were performed in TZM-Bl cell lines using CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains. The microbiome analysis was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Th effects of metabolites on bacterial species viability were determined using several clinical isolates. We observed an enrichment of dipeptides in EC compared to VP and HC (adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.05). <i>In silico</i> analysis by molecular docking, <i>in vitro</i> biochemical assays, and <i>ex vivo</i> infection assays identified anti-HIV-1 properties for two dipeptides (WG and VQ) that could bind to the HIV-1 gp120, of which WG was more potent. The microbiome analysis identified enrichment of the genus <i>Prevotella</i> in EC, and these dipeptides supported bacterial growth of the genus <i>Prevotella in vitro</i>. The enrichments of the dipeptides and higher abundance of <i>Prevotella</i> have a distinct mechanism of elite control status in HIV-1 infection that influences host metabolism. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) are a rare group among HIV-1-infected individuals who can naturally control viral replication for a prolonged period. Due to their heterogeneous nature, no universal mechanism could be attributed to the EC status; instead, several host and viral factors have been discussed as playing a role. In this study, we investigated the fecal metabolome and microbiome in a Swedish cohort of EC, treatment-naive viremic progressors (VP), and HIV-negative individuals (HC). We observed an enrichment of dipeptides in EC compared to the other two study groups. <i>In silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> analyses identified anti-HIV-1 properties for two dipeptides that could bind to the HIV-1 gp120 and act as an HIV-1 antagonist. Furthermore, these dipeptides supported bacterial growth of the genus <i>Prevotella in vitro</i> that was enriched in EC, which influences host metabolism. Thus, increased levels of both dipeptides and <i>Prevotella</i> could provide beneficial effects for EC."
