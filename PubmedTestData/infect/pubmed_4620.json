        "Klebsiella commonly colonizes the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients and is a leading cause of health care-associated infections. Colonization is associated with subsequent infection, but the factors determining this progression are unclear. A cohort study was performed, in which intensive care and hematology/oncology patients with Klebsiella colonization based on rectal swab culture were enrolled and monitored for infection for 90\u2009days after a positive swab. Electronic medical records were analyzed for patient factors associated with subsequent infection, and variables of potential significance in a bivariable analysis were used to build a final multivariable model. Concordance between colonizing and infecting isolates was assessed by <i>wzi</i> capsular gene sequencing. Among 2,087 hospitalizations from 1,978 colonized patients, 90 cases of infection (4.3%) were identified. The mean time to infection was 20.6\u2009\u00b1\u200924.69 (range, 0 to 91; median, 11.5) days. Of 86 typed cases, 68 unique <i>wzi</i> types were identified, and 69 cases (80.2%) were colonized with an isolate of the same type prior to infection. Based on multivariable modeling, overall comorbidities, depression, and low albumin levels at the time of rectal swab collection were independently associated with subsequent Klebsiella infection (i.e., cases). Despite the high diversity of colonizing strains of Klebsiella, there is high concordance with subsequent infecting isolates, and progression to infection is relatively quick. Readily accessible data from the medical record could be used by clinicians to identify colonized patients at an increased risk of subsequent Klebsiella infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Klebsiella is a leading cause of health care-associated infections. Patients who are intestinally colonized with Klebsiella are at a significantly increased risk of subsequent infection, but only a subset of colonized patients progress to disease. Colonization offers a potential window of opportunity to intervene and prevent these infections, if the patients at greatest risk could be identified. To identify patient factors associated with infection in colonized patients, we studied 1,978 colonized patients. We found that patients with a higher burden of underlying disease in general, depression in particular, and low albumin levels in a blood test were more likely to develop infection. However, these variables did not completely predict infection, suggesting that other host and microbial factors may also be important. The clinical variables associated with infection are readily available in the medical record and could serve as the foundation for developing an integrated risk assessment of Klebsiella infection in hospitalized patients."
