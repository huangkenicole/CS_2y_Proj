        "Human adenoviruses type 3 (HAdV-3) and type 55 (HAdV-55) are frequently encountered, highly contagious respiratory pathogens with high morbidity rate. In contrast to HAdV-3, one of the most predominant types in children, HAdV-55 is a reemergent pathogen associated with more severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults, especially in military camps. However, the infectivity and pathogenicity differences between these viruses remain unknown as <i>in vivo</i> models are not available. Here, we report a novel system utilizing human embryonic stem cells-derived 3-dimensional airway organoids (hAWOs) and alveolar organoids (hALOs) to investigate these two viruses. Firstly, HAdV-55 replicated more robustly than HAdV-3. Secondly, cell tropism analysis in hAWOs and hALOs by immunofluorescence staining revealed that HAdV-55 infected more airway and alveolar stem cells (basal and AT2 cells) than HAdV-3, which may lead to impairment of self-renewal functions post-injury and the loss of cell differentiation in lungs. Additionally, the viral life cycles of HAdV-3 and -55 in organoids were also observed using Transmission Electron Microscopy. This study presents a useful pair of lung organoids for modeling infection and replication differences between respiratory pathogens, illustrating that HAdV-55 has relatively higher replication efficiency and more specific cell tropism in human lung organoids than HAdV-3, which may result in relatively higher pathogenicity and virulence of HAdV-55 in human lungs. The model system is also suitable for evaluating potential antiviral drugs, as demonstrated with cidofovir. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Human adenovirus (HAdV) infections are a major threat worldwide. HAdV-3 is one of the most predominant respiratory pathogen types found in children. Many clinical studies have reported that HAdV-3 causes less severe disease. In contrast, HAdV-55, a reemergent acute respiratory disease pathogen, is associated with severe community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Currently, no ideal <i>in vivo</i> models are available for studying HAdVs. Therefore, the mechanism of infectivity and pathogenicity differences between human adenoviruses remain unknown. In this study, a useful pair of 3-dimensional (3D) airway organoids (hAWOs) and alveolar organoids (hALOs) were developed to serve as a model. The life cycles of HAdV-3 and HAdV-55 in these human lung organoids were documented for the first time. These 3D organoids harbor different cell types, which are similar to the ones found in humans. This allows for the study of the natural target cells for infection. The finding of differences in replication efficiency and cell tropism between HAdV-55 and -3 may provide insights into the mechanism of clinical pathogenicity differences between these two important HAdV types. Additionally, this study provides a viable and effective <i>in vitro</i> tool for evaluating potential anti-adenoviral treatments."
