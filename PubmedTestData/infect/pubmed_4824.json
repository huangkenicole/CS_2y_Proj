        "Chlamydiae are important reproductive tract pathogens in a wide variety of animals. In humans, chronic or repeated infection of the female genital tract with Chlamydia trachomatis has been identified as a significant factor in the development of occlusive infertility or increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The spectrum of reproductive disease recognized in sheep to be caused by Chlamydia psittaci has been primarily restricted to pregnant animals because the organism was clearly identified as a major cause of infectious abortion. However, following pregnancy failure, a chronic chlamydial infection can become established in the reproductive tracts of experimentally infected ewes. Persistent infection of the ewe's reproductive tract may eventually result in pathology, similar to that observed in women infected with C. trachomatis, thus decreasing the breeding life of affected ewes. Furthermore, ewes that experienced C. psittaci induced abortion provide a unique opportunity to study the host: parasite dynamic as it relates to persistent infection. This natural model of persistent infection may, in some ways, be superior to more contrived models in which the chlamydial isolate is not a normal reproductive pathogen of the study animal. Thus, the study of persistent chlamydial infection in sheep may be used for the benefit of both human and veterinary medicine."
