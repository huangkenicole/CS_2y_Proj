        "The effect of ovotransferrin (ovoTF), human lactoferrin (hLF) and bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydophila (Cp.) psittaci was evaluated using a model of Buffalo Green Monkey kidney (BGM) cells and HD11 chicken macrophages as artificial hosts. Firstly, the effect of transferrins on the infectivity of the bacteria was evaluated. Pre-incubation of Cp. psittaci with 0.5 to 5 mg/mL ovoTF prior to infecting BGM cells significantly lowered the infection rate (P < 0.05). For both lactoferrins, the infection rate could only be reduced with 5 mg/mL, albeit not significantly as compared to the infection rate created by the untreated bacteria. Secondly, transferrins were tested for their ability to influence bacterial adhesion and entry in HD11 cells. Maximal non-cytotoxic and non-bactericidal concentrations of 0.05 mg/mL ovoTF and 0.5 mg/mL hLF and bLF were used. Overall, ovoTF was more effective than human and bovine LF in inhibiting bacterial irreversible attachment and cell entry and the latter was accompanied by a dose-dependent reduction of actin recruitment at the bacterial entry site. However, once bacteria had entered HD11 cells, transferrins had apparently no effect on intracellular replication. The present findings suggest a possible role for transferrins and especially ovoTF, in preventing avian Cp. psittaci infections."
