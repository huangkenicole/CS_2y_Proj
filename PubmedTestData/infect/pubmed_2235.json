        "The importance of Campylobacter species other than C. jejuni/coli in diarrhoeal disease is largely unknown. We wished to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of C. concisus infection in patients with enteric disease in a tertiary hospital. Stool specimens were routinely tested for the presence of Campylobacter species, by use of the filter isolation method. The medical records of the C. concisus-positive patients were reviewed. Of 224 Campylobacter isolates obtained, 110 were identified as C. concisus. Concomitant infection occurred in only 27% of cases. By means of protein profiling we assigned C. concisus into 2 groups. The predominant C. concisus group 2 was the only strain to infect immunocompetent patients and children: 71% of the infected patients were immunocompromised, the majority being adults (84%). C. concisus may be a frequent cause of diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients. Two groups of C. concisus were found and these groups possibly vary in their pathogenic potential."
