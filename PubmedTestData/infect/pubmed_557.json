        "Many monogeneans are pathogenic to economically important fish in Japan. However no other monogenean is comparable with the diclidophorids, Heterobothrium okamotoi and Neoheterobothrium hirame, on the scale of impacts they inflict on Japanese fisheries. The shared importance of the two monogenean infections lies in their pathogenicity, fecundity and tolerance to chemical treatment. Heterobothrium okamotoi infects the gills and wall of the branchial cavity of the tiger puffer, Takifugu rubripes (Tetraodontidae), which is widely cultured in western Japan. The main presenting signs of infected fish are anaemia and extensive necrosis caused by adult worms. This monogenean deposits long strings of eggs, which reach lengths of almost 3 m. Egg entanglement with the mesh of culture nets increases the chance of hatched larvae encountering susceptible fish. The oncomiracidium maintains infectivity for up to 4 days after hatching. Hydrogen peroxide is the only commercially available chemical able to control the infection, but can only kill immature worms on the gills. Neoheterobothrium hirame infects the gills and wall of the buccal cavity of the Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Paralichthyidae). Since the first known occurrence of this monogenean in 1993, the species has been recorded from almost all areas where the host is distributed. Neoheterobothrium hirame has the potential to produce 781 eggs per day at 20 degree C. In the western Sea of Japan, wild young-of-the-year flounder became infected in early summer, followed by a sharp increase in prevalence in late summer. By late summer, juvenile flounder have nearly disappeared from the area, strongly suggesting that N. hirame is responsible for mortality of young fish. This is in good agreement with the recent decline in the local flounder population. Neoheterobothrium hirame has also been considered the causative agent of anaemia among wild Japanese flounder since the late 1990s."
