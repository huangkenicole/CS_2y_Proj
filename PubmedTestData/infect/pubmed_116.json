      "AbstractText": [
        "Pulmonary pathogens encounter numerous insults, including phagocytic cells designed to degrade bacteria, while establishing infection in the human lung. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a versatile, opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe pneumonia, and methicillin-resistant isolates are of particular concern. Recent reports present conflicting data regarding the ability of <i>S. aureus</i> to survive and replicate within macrophages. However, due to use of multiple strains and macrophage sources, making comparisons between reports remains difficult. Here, we established a disease-relevant platform to study innate interactions between <i>S. aureus</i> and human lungs. <u>H</u>uman <u>p</u>recision-<u>c</u>ut <u>l</u>ung <u>s</u>lices (hPCLS) were subjected to infection by <i>S. aureus</i> LAC (methicillin-resistant) or UAMS-1 (methicillin-sensitive) isolates. Additionally, primary human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) were infected with <i>S. aureus</i>, and antibacterial activity was assessed. Although both <i>S. aureus</i> isolates survived within hAM phagosomes, neither strain replicated efficiently in these cells. <i>S. aureus</i> was prevalent within the epithelial and interstitial regions of hPCLS, with limited numbers present in a subset of hAMs, suggesting that the pathogen may not target phagocytic cells for intracellular growth during natural pulmonary infection. <i>S. aureus</i>-infected hAMs mounted a robust inflammatory response that reflected natural human disease. <i>S. aureus</i> LAC was significantly more cytotoxic to hAMs than UAMS-1, potentially due to isolate-specific virulence factors. The bicomponent toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin was not produced during intracellular infection, while alpha-hemolysin was produced but was not hemolytic, suggesting that hAMs alter toxin activity. Overall, this study defined a new disease-relevant infection platform to study <i>S. aureus</i> interaction with human lungs and to define virulence factors that incapacitate pulmonary cells."
