      "AbstractText": [
        "Screening of CMV infection in 450 pregnant women in Shenyang was carried on by ELISA and PCR methods, and CMV infection was detected in 100 of their infants prospectively. The results were 97.11% of pregnant women with past infection, 0.89% with primary infection, 11.11% with recurrent infection, only 2% were susceptible. From 450 pregnant women, there were 3 infants with congenital defects and 3 abortions in active infective group, who were positive for IgM antibody, CMV DNA were positive in heparin peripheral blood, cervical secretion, placenta or amnionic fluid. The fetal infection rate and congenital defect rate in infective group were higher than that in inactive control group. Within 100 maternal-infant pair group, congenitally infected infants were 1.43 times higher in infective group than that in control group (RR = 1.43). Two infants with mental retardations (MDI<70) were born in infective group, but none in control group. In our study, primary infection of early pregnancy was most harmful to fetus, the intrauterine transmission rate was 33.3%. Among nine infected infants born from the infective group, two infants were with CID, and seven were symptomless. CMV screening is important for pregnant women in view of eugenic. When active CMV infection is found in early pregnancy, termination of pregnancy is better considered while CMV detection of amniotic fluid is also positive."
