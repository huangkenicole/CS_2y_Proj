        "Physical exercise is a common type of planned physical activity in order to enhance or maintain a person's physical fitness. Physical exercise may act as an effective strategy to take control of certain conditions associated with HIV-1 infection. HIV infection and its related treatments not only affect the immune system but also cause several musculoskeletal disorders including pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia, myalgia, and low bone mineral density. Moderate- to high-intensity aerobic exercise, progressive resistance exercise, or a combination of both is considered as a complementary part of medical care and treatment of HIV-infected individuals. In the present chapter, the results of recent investigations regarding the effects of physical activity on muscle strength and function, mental health, and immune system of HIV infected individuals will be discussed."
