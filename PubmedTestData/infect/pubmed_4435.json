      "AbstractText": [
        "As a strict human pathogen, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (group A <i>Streptococcus</i>, or GAS) causes a wide range of infections, from superficial to life-threatening diseases, upon dissemination. Thus, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of how GAS successfully overcomes host-mediated challenges and infects various host niches. We previously identified <u>s</u>ub<u>c</u>utaneous <u>f</u>itness (<i>scf</i>) genes in the clinically relevant wild-type (WT) GAS M1T1 5448 strain that are critical for fitness during murine soft-tissue infection at both 24 h and 48 h postinfection. The uncharacterized locus <i>scfCDE</i> was transcribed as an operon and is predicted to encode an ABC importer for nutrient uptake (e.g., amino acids). Individual <i>scfCDE</i> deletion mutants grew comparably to WT 5448 in rich medium but exhibited reduced fitness during competitive growth in murine soft tissue and in nutrient-limiting chemically defined medium (CDM). A deletion of the permease gene <i>scfD</i> resulted in a monoculture growth defect in CDM that could be rescued by addition of excess peptides, suggesting a role as an amino acid importer. Interestingly, the \u0394<i>scfC</i> substrate-binding and \u0394<i>scfD</i> permease mutants, but not the \u0394<i>scfE</i> ATPase mutant, were highly attenuated in murine soft tissue. Moreover, all three genes were required for GAS survival in human blood, indicating their impact is not limited to superficial infections. As such, <i>scfCDE</i> plays an integral role in enhancing GAS adaptation during localized infection as well as dissemination to deeper host environments. Since <i>scfCDE</i> is conserved throughout <i>Firmicutes</i>, this work may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies against GAS and other Gram-positive pathogens."
