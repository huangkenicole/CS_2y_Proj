        "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been shown to be a leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. Nevertheless, few reports regarding hMPV infections over consecutive years in children in primary care settings are available. We carried out virologic and clinical studies to determine the role of hMPV in febrile lower respiratory infections in children at a primary care clinic over 3 years and 5 months. Nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children with acute respiratory tract infections accompanied by high-grade fever (> or = 39 degrees C) and productive cough were studied for hMPV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and for other respiratory viruses by viral cultures and immunoassays. Of 379 patients tested, 202 were positive for at least 1 virus, including 98 with hMPV, 69 with respiratory syncytial virus, 18 with adenovirus, 12 with enterovirus, 8 with parainfluenza virus, 3 with rhinovirus, 2 with influenza virus type C, and 1 with herpes simplex virus. The male:female ratio of hMPV-infected children was 0.96:1 with an overall mean age of 3.5 years (range, 2 months to 9 years). These infections occurred predominantly from February to July, and the hospitalization rate was 4%. Of 93 patients infected with hMPV alone, 52 (56%) showed evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection."
