        "Due to non-productive infections, mice are not a good model to study some human adenoviruses. However, mice provide an excellent model to study the metabolic effects of human adenovirus, Ad36. Research interest in Ad36 is increasing rapidly, and consequently an increase in the use of mice as a model is anticipated. However, little is known about the transmission potential of Ad36 from infected mice to other laboratory animals or personnel. While underestimating the infectivity could promote inadvertent spread of Ad36, overstating it could drain valuable laboratory resources and animals. Therefore, we determined the duration of infectivity in female C57BL/6J mice that were experimentally infected with human adenoviruses Ad36 or Ad2. Other uninfected mice were co-housed for one week with the experimentally-infected animals, four or eight weeks postinfection. Additionally, uninfected mice were housed in the cages of mice that were infected with Ad36, 12 weeks earlier. The presence of viral DNA in tissues was used to indicate infection of mice. Although experimentally-infected mice harboured viral DNA at least up to 12 weeks, the horizontal transmission of infection was observed in co-housed mice only up to four weeks postinfection. Thus, Ad36-infected mice should be considered potentially infective for eight weeks and appropriate handling and barrier containment should be used. After eight week postinfection, horizontal transmission appears unlikely. This information may provide guidelines for animal handling, and experimental design using Ad36, which may increase safety for laboratory personnel and reduce the number of mice required for experiments."
