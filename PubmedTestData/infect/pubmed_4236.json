        "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted by hematophagous insects, primarily mosquitoes. The geographic range and prevalence of mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors has dramatically increased over the last 50 years. As a result, the most medically important arboviurses now co-exist in many regions, resulting in an increased frequency of co-infections in hosts and vectors. In addition to concurrent infections with human pathogens, mosquito-only viruses and/or enzootic viruses not associated with human disease are ubiquitous in mosquito populations. Moreover, mosquito-borne viruses are largely RNA viruses that exist within individual hosts as a diverse and dynamic swarm of closely related genotypes. Interactions among co-infecting viruses and genotypes can have profound effects on virulence, fitness and evolution. Here, we review our understanding of how these complex interactions influence transmission of mosquito-borne viruses, focusing on the often-neglected virus interactions in the mosquito vector, and identify gaps in our knowledge that should guide future studies."
