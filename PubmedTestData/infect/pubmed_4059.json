        "The comparative efficiency of the percutaneous and per-oral routes of infection was studied in goats experimentally infected with Schistosoma bovis. The heaviest infection was obtained by the percutaneous route, but a relatively high parasite load was also achieved by the per-oral route, i.e., where goats were allowed to drink a cercarial suspension, volume of 0.9 to 1.7 litre per animal. Studies using radio-isotopically labelled cercariae were designed to clarify the cercarial penetration sites following uptake by drinking. Radioactivity could be demonstrated in the outer lips, buccal cavity, oesophagus and the reticulum, omasum and rumen. Highest counts were recorded in outer lips, reticulum and rumen constituting 41.2, 22.1 and 20.6%, respectively, of total radioactivity recovered. It is concluded that the per-oral infection route may play a larger role than hitherto anticipated in infection of ruminants, and possibly also in other mammals, with schistosomes. The epidemiological implications of the present findings are discussed."
