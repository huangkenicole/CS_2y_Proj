      "AbstractText": [
        "Cryptococcosis is an infectious disease caused by two fungal species, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i> While <i>C. neoformans</i> affects mainly immunocompromised patients, <i>C. gattii</i> infects both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Laccase is an important virulence factor that contributes to the virulence of <i>C. neoformans</i> by promoting pulmonary growth and dissemination to the brain. The presence of laccase in <i>C. neoformans</i> can shift the host immune response toward a nonprotective Th2-type response. However, the role of laccase in the immune response against <i>C. gattii</i> remains unclear. In this study, we characterized laccase activity in <i>C. neoformans</i> and <i>C. gattii</i> isolates from Thailand and investigated whether <i>C. gattii</i> that is deficient in laccase might modulate immune responses during infection. <i>C. gattii</i> was found to have higher laccase activity than <i>C. neoformans</i>, indicating the importance of laccase in the pathogenesis of <i>C. gattii</i> infection. The expression of laccase promoted intracellular proliferation in macrophages and inhibited <i>in vitro</i> fungal clearance. Mice infected with a <i>lac1\u0394</i> mutant strain of <i>C. gattii</i> had reduced lung burdens at the early but not the late stage of infection. Without affecting type-1 and type-2 responses, the deficiency of laccase in <i>C. gattii</i> induced cryptococcus-specific interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokine, neutrophil accumulation, and expression of the neutrophil-associated cytokine gene <i>Csf3</i> and chemokine genes <i>Cxcl1, Cxcl2</i>, and <i>Cxcl5 in vivo</i>, as well as enhanced neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis and killing <i>in vitro</i> Thus, our data suggest that laccase constitutes an important virulence factor of <i>C. gattii</i> that plays roles in attenuating Th17-type immunity, neutrophil recruitment, and function during the early stage of infection."
