        "Trichinella spiralis and Toxocara canis larvae migrated through the lung and induced many alterations in the lung parenchyma. Using electron microscopy, we identified and described the histopathological changes. These changes resulted from mechanical damage or from local inflammatory reactions provoked by larvae. The pattern of changes was described between 6 and 12 days post-infection (DPI) with T.\u00a0spiralis larvae, and between 21 and 28 DPI with T.\u00a0canis. The ultrastructural studies demonstrated that T.\u00a0spiralis larvae migrating through the lungs evoked mainly destruction of type I epithelial cells, destruction of lamellar bodies of epithelial cells or extracellular alveolar lining layer. The severity of these changes was dependent on the number of infective larvae (400 or 800 T.\u00a0spiralis larvae) and possibly the result of mechanical damage in the lung parenchyma. In contrast, infection with T.\u00a0canis larvae initiated mainly eosinophilic perivasculitis and vasculitis as well as macrophage accumulation in the lung, which were additionally impacted by numerous crystalloid inclusions in macrophages. Trichinella spiralis larvae and T.\u00a0canis larvae induced different pathological changes in the lungs of infected mice."
