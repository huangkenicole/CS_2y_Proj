      "AbstractText": [
        "Aerococcus sanguinicola and Aerococcus urinae are emerging pathogens in clinical settings mostly being causative agents of urinary tract infections (UTIs), urogenic sepsis and more seldomly complicated infective endocarditis (IE). Limited knowledge exists concerning the pathogenicity of these two species. Eight clinical A.\u00a0sanguinicola (isolated from 2009 to 2015) and 40 clinical A.\u00a0urinae (isolated from 1984 to 2015) strains from episodes of UTIs, bacteremia, and IE were whole-genome sequenced (WGS) to analyze genomic diversity and characterization of virulence genes involved in the bacterial pathogenicity. A.\u00a0sanguinicola genome sizes were 2.06-2.12\u00a0Mb with 47.4-47.6% GC-contents, and 1783-1905 genes were predicted whereof 1170 were core-genes. In case of A.\u00a0urinae strains, the genome sizes were 1.93-2.44\u00a0Mb with 41.6-42.6% GC-contents, and 1708-2256 genes of which 907 were core-genes. Marked differences were observed within A.\u00a0urinae strains with respect to the average genome sizes, number and sequence identity of core-genes, proteome conservations, phylogenetic analysis, and putative capsular polysaccharide (CPS) loci sequences. Strains of A.\u00a0sanguinicola showed high degree of homology. Phylogenetic analyses showed the 40 A.\u00a0urinae strains formed two clusters according to two time periods: 1984-2004 strains and 2010-2015 strains. Genes that were homologs to virulence genes associated with bacterial adhesion and antiphagocytosis were identified by aligning A.\u00a0sanguinicola and A.\u00a0urinae pan- and core-genes against Virulence Factors of Bacterial Pathogens (VFDB). Bacterial adherence associated gene homologs were present in genomes of A.\u00a0sanguinicola (htpB, fbpA, lmb, and ilpA) and A.\u00a0urinae (htpB, lap, lmb, fbp54, and ilpA). Fifteen and 11-16 CPS gene homologs were identified in genomes of A.\u00a0sanguinicola and A.\u00a0urinae strains, respectively. Analysis of these genes identified one type of putative CPS locus within all A.\u00a0sanguinicola strains. In A.\u00a0urinae genomes, five different CPS loci types were identified with variations in CPS locus sizes, genetic content, and structural organization. In conclusion, this is the first study dealing with WGS and comparative genomics of clinical A.\u00a0sanguinicola and A.\u00a0urinae strains from episodes of UTIs, bacteremia, and IE. Gene homologs associated with antiphagocytosis and bacterial adherence were identified and genetic variability was observed within A.\u00a0urinae genomes. These findings contribute with important knowledge and basis for future molecular and experimental pathogenicity study of UTIs, bacteremia, and IE causing A.\u00a0sanguinicola and A.\u00a0urinae strains."
