        "Induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice was used to study the pathogenicity of Prevotella bivia both in mono-infection and in mixed cultures with Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Virulence factors such as coaggregation and aggregate formation of cells, haemagglutination activity and tolerance to serum bactericidal activity were investigated for their possible role in P bivia pathogenicity. Monocultures of P bivia, E coli and Peptostreptococcus spp did not induce subcutaneous abscess at concentrations as high as 10(9) colony forming units/millilitre (cfu/ml). Only E coli persisted at the infection site for up to 7 days post infection but with a marked decline in cell count (8.0 x 10(2) cfu/ml). The anaerobic organisms did not persist at the infection sites beyond the fifth day. In contrast, mixed cultures of P bivia and E coli or all three organisms potentiated for infective abscess two weeks after infection. Viable cells were recovered from abscesses in greater numbers as the infection progressed. Prevotella bivia was the predominant organism in chronic abscesses while E coli predominated in abscesses in the acute stage of the infection. Prevotella bivia lacked haemagglutination activity against human and sheep erythrocytes and showed marked susceptibility to 50 per cent human serum. These may limit its haematogenous spread. Its ability to form aggregates in molar salt solutions and coaggregate with facultative organisms may account for its persistence in pathological sites."
