        "A total of 100 herpes simplex viruses isolated from lesions not responding to acyclovir (ACV) therapy were recovered from 51 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. In vitro analysis of these isolates included testing their susceptibility to ACV and determining their thymidine kinase (TK) phenotypes. Of the 100 isolates evaluated, 23 were ACV sensitive and 77 were ACV resistant. Seventy-four of these ACV-resistant isolates were of the TK-deficient or low-TK-producer phenotype and three were of the TK-altered phenotype. The TKs isolates that represented each of the different autoradiographic phenotypes were further characterized by enzyme kinetics. The ability of selected isolates to cause disease in vivo was evaluated by using several mouse virulence models. Cutaneous virulence in normal and immunocompromised mice was evaluated, and neurovirulence in normal mice was determined. Latent infections were assayed by the cocultivation of trigeminal ganglia recovered from mice that had survived acute infection. These reactivated viruses were evaluated in vitro and compared with the original infecting isolate. The mechanisms of resistance and pathogenicity of these herpes simplex virus isolates recovered from patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus are similar to those reported for isolates recovered from normal and immunocompromised patients without AIDS."
