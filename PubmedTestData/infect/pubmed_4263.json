      "AbstractText": [
        "Bungowannah virus is a novel pestivirus identified from a disease outbreak in a piggery in Australia in June 2003. The aim of this study was to determine whether infection of pregnant pigs with Bungowannah virus induces the clinical signs and gross pathology observed during the initial outbreak and how this correlates with the time of infection. Twenty-four pregnant pigs were infected at one of four stages of gestation (approximately 35, 55, 75 or 90 days). The number of progeny born alive, stillborn or mummified, and signs of disease were recorded. Some surviving piglets were euthanased at weaning and others at ages up to 11 months. All piglets were subjected to a detailed necropsy. The greatest effects were observed following infection at 35 or 90 days of gestation. Infection at 35 days resulted in a significant reduction in the number of pigs born alive and an increased number of mummified foetuses (18%) and preweaning mortalities (70%). Preweaning losses were higher following infection at 90 days of gestation (29%) and were associated with sudden death and cardiorespiratory signs. Stunting occurred in chronically and persistently infected animals. This study reproduced the clinical signs and gross pathology of the porcine myocarditis syndrome and characterised the association between the time of infection and the clinical outcome."
