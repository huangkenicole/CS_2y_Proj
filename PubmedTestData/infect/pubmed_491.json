        "Groups of Theileria annulata infected Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum adults prefed on a calf for 1 to 6 days were separately ground in tissue culture medium-199, supplemented with bovine albumin powder, Fraction-V. Supernatant fluid was collected, made up with additional medium, so that each millilitre represented material from 25 ticks, and was injected subcutaneously into groups of cross-bred male calves. The results indicated that ground-up tick supernate (GUTS) prepared from unfed ticks was not infective, whereas that prepared from 1 to 6 days prefed ticks was infective. GUTS prepared from 3 days prefed ticks appeared to contain highest infectivity and 1 ml of it induced fatal theileriosis."
