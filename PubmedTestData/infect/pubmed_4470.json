        "The epizootiology of sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) was studied in experimentally and naturally infected rats. The infectivity of SDA virus (SDAV) in intranasally infected rats was lost by seven days after infection as determined by contact transmission. After experimental infection, SN antibody appeared earlier and titers were detectable longer than CF antibody. The prevalence of SN antibody-positive rats in naturally infected colonies remained high, whereas an increase in the prevalence of CF antibody-positive rats appeared to coincide with the introduction or resurgence of SDAV. A SDAV-free colony was established by allowing recovered dams to litter in a separate room. A spontaneous cessation of SDAV infection also was observed in an enzootically-infected colony. Clinical observations indicated that SDA can occur as a mild or asymptomatic disease, and that its clinical expression may vary from one inbred strain to another."
