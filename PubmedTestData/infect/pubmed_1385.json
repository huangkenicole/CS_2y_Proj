      "AbstractText": [
        "<i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> is a foodborne pathogen that infects the placenta and can cause pregnancy complications. Listeriosis usually occurs as a sporadic infection, but large outbreaks are also reported. Virulence from clinical isolates is rarely analyzed due to the large number of animals required, but this knowledge could help guide the response to an outbreak. We implemented a DNA barcode system using signature tags that allowed us to efficiently assay variations in virulence across a large number of isolates. We tested 77 signature-tagged clones of clinical <i>L. monocytogenes</i> strains from 72 infected human placentas and 5 immunocompromised patients, all of which were isolated since 2000. These strains were tested for virulence in a modified competition assay in comparison to that of the laboratory strain 10403S. We used two <i>in vivo</i> models of listeriosis: the nonpregnant mouse and the pregnant guinea pig. Strains that were frequently found at a high abundance within infected organs were considered hypervirulent, while strains frequently found at a low abundance were considered hypovirulent. Virulence split relatively evenly among hypovirulent strains, hypervirulent strains, and strains as virulent as 10403S. The laboratory strain was found to have an intermediate virulence phenotype, supporting its suitability for use in pathogenesis studies. Further, we found that splenic virulence and placental virulence are closely linked in both the guinea pig and mouse models. This suggests that outbreak and sporadic pregnancy-associated <i>L. monocytogenes</i> strains are not generally more virulent than lab reference strains. However, some strains did show consistent and reproducible virulence differences, suggesting that their further study may reveal deeper insights into the biological underpinnings of listeriosis."
