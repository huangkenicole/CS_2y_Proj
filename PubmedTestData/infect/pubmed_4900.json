        "In the light of literature reports and own experiences and observations the most important epidemiological aspects of HIV infection acquired through sexual contacts are discussed, including the likelihood of infection during heterosexual or homosexual intercourse, factors increasing the infection risk in homosexuals intercourse and the more or less safe forms of sexual intercourse. The combination of HIV infections with infections with other sexually transmitted diseases is discussed on the basis of own observations which showed that HIV infection was acquired much more frequently by homosexuals treated in outpatient clinics for venereological diseases (19.7%) as compared to other homosexual groups (2.7%), and the risk was even lower in heterosexuals treated in these clinics for sexually transmitted diseases (0.2%). Over half the patients infected with HIV had or had had syphilis. HIV infection was sought for in Warsaw prostitutes, and 0.6% of them were found to be infected, two-thirds of the infected ones were drug addicted prostitutes. The importance of the sexual route of infection in drug addicts and transmission of this infection to the heterosexual population are considered. The principles of prophylaxis, the directions of health education, and the importance of screening for HIV infection prevention are considered. Attention is called to the harmful effects of all types of restriction of the infected people which lead to trials of infection concealment."
