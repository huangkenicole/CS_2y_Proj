      "AbstractText": [
        "Porcine mucin has been commonly used to enhance the infectivity of bacterial pathogens, including <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, in animal models, but the mechanisms for enhancement by mucin remain relatively unknown. In this study, using the mouse model of intraperitoneal (i.p.) mucin-enhanced <i>A. baumannii</i> infection, we characterized the kinetics of bacterial replication and dissemination and the host innate immune responses, as well as their potential contribution to mucin-enhanced bacterial virulence. We found that mucin, either admixed with or separately injected with the challenge bacterial inoculum, was able to enhance the tissue and blood burdens of <i>A. baumannii</i> strains of different virulence. Intraperitoneal injection of <i>A. baumannii</i>-mucin or mucin alone induced a significant but comparable reduction of peritoneal macrophages and lymphocytes, accompanied by a significant neutrophil recruitment and early interleukin-10 (IL-10) responses, suggesting that the resulting inflammatory cellular and cytokine responses were largely induced by the mucin. Depletion of peritoneal macrophages or neutralization of endogenous IL-10 activities showed no effect on the mucin-enhanced infectivity. However, pretreatment of mucin with iron chelator DIBI, but not deferoxamine, partially abolished its virulence enhancement ability, and replacement of mucin with iron significantly enhanced the bacterial burdens in the peritoneal cavity and lung. Taken together, our results favor the hypothesis that iron at least partially contributes to the mucin-enhanced infectivity of <i>A. baumannii</i> in this model."
