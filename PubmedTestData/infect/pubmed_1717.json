        "Twenty-five day-old White Leghorn chickens were each infected orally with 500 (Group I), 1000 (Group II) and 2000 (Group III) infective eggs of Ascaridia galli and were killed 30 days after the infection. A high percentage of the infecting dose (6.5%) established as adult worms in the intestine of chickens receiving the lowest level of primary infection, but as the amount of primary infection given to birds increased, there was a significant fall in the percentage establishment of adult worms in the intestine. A similar pattern of worm establishment was shown by chickens of the same age and receiving similar levels of primary infections, but which were treated with betamethasone at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight commencing 5 days before and continuing up to 15 days after the infection. Betamethasone-treated birds, however, showed more establishment of worms in the intestine, but lower weight gains in comparison to the birds which were not treated. Different levels of primary infections given, with or without treatment with betamethasone, had no effect on the sex ratio of the resultant male/female worm populations, which became established in almost equal numbers in the intestine of chickens."
