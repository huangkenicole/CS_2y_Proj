        "The purpose of this study was to determine the role of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) in the development of traveler's diarrhea and the clinical response of patients with EAEC diarrhea following treatment with ciprofloxacin. Sixty-four travelers with diarrhea and no other recognized enteropathogen were enrolled in treatment studies in Jamaica and Mexico from July 1997 to July 1998. EAEC was isolated from 29 travelers (45.3%). There was a significant reduction in the duration of posttreatment diarrhea in the 16 patients treated with ciprofloxacin, as compared with that in the 13 patients who received placebo (mean of 35.3 versus 55.5 hours; P = .049). There was a nonsignificant reduction in the mean number of unformed stools passed during the 72 hours after enrollment in the ciprofloxacin-treated group (5.6), as compared with that in the placebo group (7.5) (P = .128). This study provides additional evidence that EAEC should be considered as a cause of antibiotic-responsive traveler's diarrhea."
