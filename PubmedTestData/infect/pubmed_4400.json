      "AbstractText": [
        "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital virus infection. Approximately 1% of newborns are infected by CMV at birth with severe consequences among 10% of them. Efficacy of hygienic counselling is nowadays established and should be spread.",
        "To evaluate pregnant women's awareness of cytomegalovirus infection in France.",
        "Pregnant women receiving prenatal care, at any moment of their pregnancy, in two different obstetrics clinics with different information policies, were asked to complete a written questionnaire about CMV infection.",
        "More than half (217/362, 60%) of the pregnant women had heard of congenital CMV infection, and most of them (72%) knew the hygiene measures to use to prevent infection. Nevertheless, most could not correctly identify the symptoms associated with congenital CMV disease. Awareness was associated with hospital's policy concerning CMV infection information, the mother's educational level, parity, and employment in health care. Indeed, when information is supposed to be given (hospital A), 74% (vs 34%) know congenital CMV infection and among them the knowledge is more precise.",
        "This study tends to confirm that there is a large gap between knowledge of CMV and the burden of this disease. To bridge this gap, women should receive education about congenital CMV. Hospital-based prenatal education increases awareness and knowledge about CMV and CMV prevention."
