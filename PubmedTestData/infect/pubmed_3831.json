        "Marine mammal Brucella strains with different genomic characteristics according to distribution of IS711 elements in their genomes were analysed for their intracellular behaviour in human THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Seven different groups of marine mammal strains were identified including a human isolate from New Zealand presumably from marine origin. Entry and intracellular survival of strains representative of these groups in THP-1 human macrophage-like cells were analysed at several times of infection. Three patterns of infection were identified. The Brucella strain isolated from the human case from New Zealand, and two other groups of strains belonging to B. ceti or B. pinnipedialis were able to infect THP-1 macrophage cells to the same extent as the virulent strains B. suis 1330 or B. melitensis 16M. Three other groups of strains belonging to B. ceti or B. pinnipedialis were able to enter the cells as classical virulent strains but were eliminated after 48h. The last group was composed only of strains isolated from hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) and was even unable to enter and infect THP-1 macrophage cells. Thus, several groups of marine mammal Brucella strains appear to be non-infectious for human macrophages."
