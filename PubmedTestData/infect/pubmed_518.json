        "Growing points and problem areas in the field of urinary tract infections are critically surveyed. It is concluded that there is a particular need for advances in rapid tests for bacteriuria (to distinguish between symptomatic patients who are infected and those who are not) and for the determination of antibiotic sensitivity of infecting organisms. The aetiology of the \"urethral syndrome\" (dysuria and/or frequency without a significant bacteriuria) is still obscure although it is becoming clear what suggested possible causes are not responsible for it. Another unresolved problem is whether or not to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in all groups of patients especially the elderly, and in the absence of pyuria. Similarly it is still not decided what are the optimal lengths of time and dosages of antibiotics to treat various types of urinary infections. Finally, difficulties involved in preventing infections of in-dwelling catheters, and the possibility of obtaining a protective vaccine are discussed."
