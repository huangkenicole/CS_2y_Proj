        "Dermatologic diseases encompass a broad category of pathologic situations. Infection remains a significant aspect of the pathology faced in patient encounters, and it is natural to expect that anti-infectives play a major element in the armamentarium utilized by dermatologists. Aside from the treatment of the classic bacterial and fungal infections, there are now new uses for antiviral agents to help suppress recurrent disease, such as herpes simplex. There is also the novel approach of using anti-infectives, or agents that have been thought to have antimicrobial activity, to treat inflammatory diseases. This review describes anti-infectives, beginning with common antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. The discussion will then cover the current use of antivirals. Finally, the description of antifungals will be separated, starting with the oral agents and ending with the topical antimycotics. The use of anti-infectives in tropical dermatology has been purposefully left out, and perhaps should be the subject of a separate review. Cutaneous bacterial infections consist chiefly of those microorganisms that colonize the skin, such as species of staphylococcus and streptococcus. Propionibacterium acnes and certain other anaerobes can be involved in folliculitis, pyodermas and in chronic conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa."
