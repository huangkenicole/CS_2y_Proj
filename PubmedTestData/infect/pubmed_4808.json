        "This study describes the development of Cryptosporidium parvum in MDCK, MA-104, Hep-2 and Vero cell lines. Differences in susceptibility, infectivity, and the methodology of excystation were determined. Various solutions were considered to determine the factors which enhanced the excystation (eg with and without sodium hypochlorite, trypsin or sodium taurocholate). It was shown that the sporozoites could be excysted in media either with or without trypsin and sodium taurocholate, but the number of sporozoites in the latter solution was less than the former one. Only oocysts digested by sodium hypochlorite and trypsin can enter the culture cells. Numerous meronts and oocysts were demonstrated and persisted for 9 days. Asexual stages were not observed in MA-104. Only few oocysts could be detected 1-3 days post-inoculation. There was a significant difference between the number of oocysts, which invaded MDCK, MA-104, and Hep-2 cells. MDCK gave the highest susceptibility to oocyst invasion among the three cell lines and asexual stages were also found. Among the 25 isolates, which had been cultivated, 23 isolates could infect MDCK and Hep-2. Only 2 isolates could not infect the MDCK cell. These 2 isolates could infect the Vero cell and yielded high numbers of trophozoites. Praziquantel (PZQ), doxycycline, and paromomycin (PRM) were tested on the infecting parasites. The drugs were added either with the inoculum or 24 hours after inoculation. None of them was effective, including PRM, which had been previously reported as effective."
