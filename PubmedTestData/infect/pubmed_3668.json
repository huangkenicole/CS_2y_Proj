      "AbstractText": [
        "Seven immortalized B cell clones, five of which secreted specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against hepatitis B, tetanus toxoid, and Rhesus D antigens, were evaluated for their susceptibility to infection by human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Infection was confirmed in three human MAb-producing lines by detection of infectious virus and p24 antigen in culture supernates, by immunofluorescence, and by detection of viral DNA in cells by polymerase chain reaction. The infectable lines were as susceptible to HIV-1 infection as several T cell lines and remained persistently infected for several months, but in contrast to T cell controls, viral cytopathic effects were not observed. Levels of unintegrated viral DNA in the HB1 B cell line were significantly lower than in the HUT78 T cell line. Cell lines that were susceptible to HIV expressed HLA DR, CD20, and CD21, whereas the uninfectable cell lines did not express any of the markers tested. CD4 was undetectable or present on a small percentage of cells in two of the infectable cell lines. However, infection with HIV-1 was blocked more efficiently in B cells than in T cells by soluble CD4, anti-CD4 MAb, and dextran sulphate. The effect of HIV infection on human MAb secretion was variable, being reduced on a per-cell basis in one line, increased in another, and unchanged in a third.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
