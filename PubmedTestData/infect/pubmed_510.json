        "Bacterial colonization of acute and chronic wounds is often associated with delayed wound healing and prolonged hospitalization. The rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria and the poor biocompatibility of topical antimicrobials warrant safe and effective antimicrobials. Antimicrobial agents that target microbial membranes without interfering with the mammalian cell proliferation and migration hold great promise in the treatment of traumatic wounds. This article reports the utility of superhydrophilic electrospun gelatin nanofiber dressings (NFDs) containing a broad-spectrum antimicrobial polymer, \u03b5-polylysine (\u03b5PL), crosslinked by polydopamine (pDA) for treating second-degree burns. In a porcine model of partial thickness burns, NFDs promoted wound closure and reduced hypertrophic scarring compared to untreated burns. Analysis of NFDs in contact with the burns indicated that the dressings trap early colonizers and elicit bactericidal activity, thus creating a sterile wound bed for fibroblasts migration and re-epithelialization. In support of these observations, in porcine models of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> colonized partial thickness burns, NFDs decreased bacterial bioburden and promoted wound closure and re-epithelialization. NFDs displayed superior clinical outcome than standard-of-care silver dressings. The excellent biocompatibility and antimicrobial efficacy of the newly developed dressings in pre-clinical models demonstrate its potential for clinical use to manage infected wounds without compromising tissue regeneration."
