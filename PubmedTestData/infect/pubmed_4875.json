      "AbstractText": [
        "An H1N1 strain of influenza virus (A/swine/England/195852/92) isolated recently from clinical epizootics in pigs was transmitted experimentally to six-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs. Between one and four days after inoculation the infected pigs developed pyrexia and showed signs of coughing, sneezing and anorexia. Seroconversion was detected seven days after infection. Virus was isolated from nasal swabs and tissues up to four days after infection, but was not recovered from faeces. Virus was isolated from serum samples taken from each infected animal for a period of only one day between one and three days after infection. The pathology was characterised by a widespread interstitial pneumonia for up to 21 days after infection, lesions in the bronchi and bronchioles for up to seven days after infection, and haemorrhagic lymph nodes. Epithelial damage in the bronchial generations as a result of the virus infection was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy."
