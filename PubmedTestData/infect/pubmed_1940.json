        "A recently developed porcine model for aerogenous infection with Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was applied in a study of the phases of bacterial colonization and initial invasion. Eighteen pigs were exposed to aerosolized S. suis serotype 2 after pre-exposure to mild acetic acid in aerosol. The animals were killed consecutively within the first six days after challenge. After death, all animals were necropsied and examined by bacteriology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Systemic infection was established in four out of 18 animals exposed to S. suis serotype 2. All systemically infected animals developed clinical signs and lesions typical of the infection. In four additional animals, subclinical infection was demonstrated by re-isolation of S. suis from the palatine tonsil. However, in all 18 challenged animals, immunohistochemistry demonstrated S. suis serotype 2 antigen in the palatine and/or nasopharyngeal tonsils. In all four systemically infected animals, S. suis serotype 2 antigen was also found in the mandibular lymph node. These observations point towards the tonsils as possible portals of entry for S. suis serotype 2 with subsequent lymphogenous spread. Thus, the present findings parallel the proposed pathogenesis for S. suis serotype 1 infection in pigs."
