      "AbstractText": [
        "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD); in some severe cases, it could develop into central nervous system (CNS) disease such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and neurogenic pulmonary edema in children under 5\u2009years. The EV-A71 pathogenesis which is involved with the CNS is unclear due to the lack of a simple and reliable mouse model thus far. Most clinical EV-A71 isolates could not effectively infect the neonatal mouse, which used to be an EV-A71 infection model. The small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) released from clinical EV-A71 isolate-infected cells were infectious in cell lines and could cause a high viral replication in mice. Neonatal ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with these infectious sEVs and showed more weight loss and higher mortality than those mice injected with the clinical EV-A71 isolate. By using these sEVs, we provided a simple and effective method by which we can generate a stable and valuable animal model for the studies of EV-A71 pathogenesis and therapy.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> EV-A71 was supposed to infect the CNS through the neural pathway and the circulation of the blood in previous studies. Reverse axon transport had been confirmed as an important pathway for EV-A71 to infect the CNS; however, it is still unknown how EV-A71 infects the CNS through the circulation of the blood. Combined with the infectivity of sEVs secreted from EV-A71-infected cells and the characteristic that sEVs could cross the blood-brain barrier, we considered that sEVs may play a vital role in EV-A71 pathogenesis of the CNS."
