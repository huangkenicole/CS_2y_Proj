        "Swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multicellular adaptation induced by semisolid medium with amino acids as a nitrogen source. By phenotypic screening, we differentiated swarming from other complex adaptive phenotypes, such as biofilm formation, swimming and twitching, by identifying a swarming-specific mutant in ptsP, a metabolic regulator. This swarming-deficient mutant was tested in an acute murine skin abscess infection model. Bacteria were recovered at significantly lower numbers from organs of mice infected with the \u2206ptsP mutant. We also tested the synthetic peptide 1018 for activity against different motilities and efficacy in vivo. Treatment with peptide 1018 mimicked the phenotype of the \u2206ptsP mutant in vitro, as swarming was inhibited at low concentrations (<2 \u03bcg/mL) but not swimming or twitching, and in vivo, as mice had a reduced bacterial load recovered from organs. Therefore, PtsP functions as a regulator of swarming, which in turn contributes to dissemination and colonization in vivo."
