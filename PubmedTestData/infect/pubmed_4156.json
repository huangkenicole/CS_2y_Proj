        "Immunocompetent and cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed ferrets were intranasally infected with canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and observed for clinical signs, histopathologic lesions, the immunocytochemical demonstration of CPIV antigen in the respiratory tract and scanning electron microscopic alterations of the tracheal epithelium until 36 days post infection (p.i.). In both groups, clinical signs were minimal, restricted to the upper respiratory tract and consisted of cough elicited by tracheal compression between 3 and 7 days p.i. Microscopically, inflammatory and degenerative lesions were observed in the trachea and less frequently in the nasal cavity; bronchiolitis or interstitial pneumonia was not demonstrated. By immunocytochemistry, CPIV antigen was demonstrated in tracheal epithelial cells, whereas nasal cavity, bronchi, bronchioles and lung were devoid of viral antigen. Ferrets given CPIV alone developed a minimal lymphocytic tracheitis with minimal loss of cilia and CPIV antigen was observed only 4 days p.i. 17 days p.i., normal epithelial organization and ciliary reappearance was reestablished. Ferrets treated with cyclophosphamide and infected with CPIV exhibited mild to moderate histological lesions as above with similar scanning electron microscopic changes until 36 p.i. Tracheal lesions consisted of intraepithelial and submucosal infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, focal epithelial hyperplasia and multifocal loss of cilia. In addition, mild and transient neutrophilic infiltration was observed. In immunosuppressed ferrets, viral antigen expression was prominent and demonstrated 4 and 8 days p.i. These data suggest that ferrets are susceptible to aerosol CPIV infection."
