        "The diverse advanced treatment modalities currently available to children with medulloblastoma, including surgery and radiotherapy, are associated with deleterious side effects and often with an unfavorable prognosis. A mutant adenovirus, Delta-24, which has a 24-base pair deletion in the Rb-binding region of the E1A gene, demonstrates selective replication and oncolysis in various malignant phenotypes. Here we report the ability of Delta-24 to kill medulloblastoma cells. Flow cytometric analyses of cell receptors demonstrated expression of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor and RGD-related integrins in the assessed medulloblastoma cell lines. Infectivity assays using a replication-deficient adenovirus to transduce the green fluorescence protein gene showed that the Delta-24 adenovirus infects 99% of Daoy and 46% of D283 Med medulloblastoma cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50. Within 4 days after infecting medulloblastoma cells with Delta-24, a noticeable cytopathic effect was produced. Delta-24 induced a total cytopathic effect in Daoy and D283 Med medulloblastoma cells after 6 and 8 days of infection, respectively. In the infected population of cells, cell death correlated with the accumulation of cells in the S phase. At 5 days post-infection with 2.5 MOIs of Delta-24 adenovirus, the percentage of Daoy medulloblastoma cells in the S phase increased to 71.9+/-5.5%, compared with control values of 20.5+/-1.4%. The release of viral progeny was quantified as being increased by two orders of magnitude, indicating efficient replication of Delta-24 in medulloblastoma cells. This is the first report of the ability of oncolytic adenoviruses to infect and kill medulloblastoma cells, the findings of which suggest the potential efficacy of Delta-24 as a therapy for human medulloblastoma tumors."
