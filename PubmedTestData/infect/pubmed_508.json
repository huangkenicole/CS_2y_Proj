        "Hantaviruses are the causative agents of HFRS and HCPS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome), two severe, and often fatal human diseases. Mortality from HFRS varies between hantaviruses; Hantaan and Dobrava show the highest, Seoul intermediate, and Puumala low mortality. Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5,000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18-26 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5,000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS-/- mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia. In conclusion, we show that Dobrava virus and Saaremaa virus induce distinct differences in terms of survival, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses in mice."
