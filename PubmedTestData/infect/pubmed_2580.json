      "AbstractText": [
        "Seneca Valley virus (SVV) has been identified as the causative agent of SVV-associated vesicular disease (SAVD). To investigate the pathogenicity of two newly isolated SVV strains (GD-S5/2018 and GD04/2017) in China, experimental infections of pigs were performed. In pig experiments, both SVV strains successfully infected all animals, evidenced by presence of virus shedding and robust protective antibody responses. SVV GD-S5/2018 infection resulted in characteristic clinical signs, and ulcerative lesions on the tongue and gums. However, SVV GD04/2017 did not cause any clinical symptoms except depression in pigs during the experiment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SVV GD-S5/2018 is a virulent strain for pigs, whereas SVV GD04/2017 is nearly avirulent. The established animal models for SVV infection will be utilized to dissect the immunity and pathogenesis, and develop vaccines and antivirals."
