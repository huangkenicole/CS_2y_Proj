      "AbstractText": [
        "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that infects the majority of the adult population regardless of socioeconomic status or geographical location. EBV primarily infects B and epithelial cells and is associated with different cancers of these cell types, such as Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. While the life cycle of EBV in B cells is well understood, EBV infection within epithelium is not, largely due to the inability to model productive replication in epithelium <i>in vitro</i>. Organotypic cultures generated from primary human keratinocytes can model many aspects of EBV infection, including productive replication in the suprabasal layers. The EBV glycoprotein BDLF2 is a positional homologue of the murine gammaherpesvirus-68 protein gp48, which plays a role in intercellular spread of viral infection, though sequence homology is limited. To determine the role that BDLF2 plays in EBV infection, we generated a recombinant EBV in which the <i>BDLF2</i> gene has been replaced with a puromycin resistance gene. The \u0394<i>BDLF2</i> recombinant virus infected both B cell and HEK293 cell lines and was able to immortalize primary B cells. However, the loss of BDLF2 resulted in substantially fewer infected cells in organotypic cultures compared to wild-type virus. While numerous clusters of infected cells representing a focus of infection are observed in wild-type-infected organotypic cultures, the majority of cells observed in the absence of BDLF2 were isolated cells, suggesting that the EBV glycoprotein BDLF2 plays a major role in intercellular viral spread in stratified epithelium. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The ubiquitous herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with cancers of B lymphocytes and epithelial cells and is primarily transmitted in saliva. While several models exist for analyzing the life cycle of EBV in B lymphocytes, models of EBV infection in the epithelium have more recently been established. Using an organotypic culture model of epithelium that we previously determined accurately reflects EBV infection <i>in situ</i>, we have ascertained that the loss of the viral envelope protein BDLF2 had little effect on the EBV life cycle in B cells but severely restricted the number of infected cells in organotypic cultures. Loss of BDLF2 has a substantial impact on the size of infected areas, suggesting that BDLF2 plays a specific role in the spread of infection in stratified epithelium."
