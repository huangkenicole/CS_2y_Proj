        "Those infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a higher risk of opportunistic infections. The risk is related to the level of immunosuppression. We report a case of a young male with the unusual scenario of three opportunistic infections occurring simultaneously: Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis and Cryptosporidiosis. Histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis are major causes of morbimortality in immunocompromised patients due to HIV infection.",
        "We report the case of a patient with HIV infection with a CD4 T lymphocyte cell (CD4) count of 2 cells/mm3, who presented with 6\u2009months of diarrhea, non-productive dry cough, nocturnal diaphoresis, fever, weight loss, and a maculopapular rash. He had a concurrent infection with three opportunistic microorganisms: fungemia by cryptococcosis, disseminated histoplasmosis confirmed by detection of the antigen in urine and chronic diarrhea by cryptosporidiosis confirmed by direct observation in feces by modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The patient received antifungal treatment with a satisfactory outcome.",
        "There are still regions where HIV detection programs are deficient thus facilitating occurrence of HIV infection cases in advanced stages of immunosuppression. A high level of suspicion of systemic mycoses and concurrent infection by several opportunistic pathogens is required in severely immunocompromised patients."
