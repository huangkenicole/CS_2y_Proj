        "Feces from mink with acute mink enteritis were pooled and then allowed to dry out in open tubes kept under a roof in an open shed for one year starting in January. Samples of feces were harvested approximately once a month. These were reconstituted to their original volume and tested for antigen content and infectivity both in in vitro cell cultures and - on selected samples - in vivo. During the first 8 months, the antigen level in the feces samples decreased slowly. At this time point, a plateau was reached at 30-40% of the original viral antigen contents. The infectivity in vitro was unchanged for the first 5 months, but after mid-summer it decreased abruptly to below the detection level. Based on the in vitro infectivity, 10 samples were selected for inoculation into mink to measure the in vivo infectivity. The transmission of the infection to the experimental animals was successful for all samples showing infective virus by cultivation. In addition, it was possible to infect mink using material harvested one month after the cell culture test had turned negative. One mink inoculated with material collected in October excreted virus. We conclude that parvovirus can survive for at least 5-10 months (or during the winter period) under natural conditions, but complete drying out seems to lead to its inactivation. Mechanical cleaning of the premises is thus as critical as disinfection since virus can only survive the dry summer period if protected by protein or buried in moist soil on the premises."
