        "In the last few years, a dramatic increase of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection in German hospitals can be recognized. Under this enormous pressure it is very important for infection control teams to assess the epidemiologic situation correctly. Therefore, a prospective multicenter hospital-based surveillance of MRSA cases was executed in four university hospitals with 1017-1333 beds in Germany. Routine surveillance data were recorded of all patients with MRSA isolates from clinical samples or screening cultures. Patients had been colonized or infected with MRSA during their hospital stay. In 2002 between 183 and 291 MRSA cases were treated in the respective hospitals (between 0.53 and 0.96 MRSA cases per 1000 patient days). Of these, 44.4% were MRSA infections. The most frequent type of MRSA infections were wound infections (56.9%) followed by pneumonia (21.0%) and bloodstream infections (15.1%). Of the infected patients 51.5% were already infected at admission. The median duration of isolation of MRSA patients in private rooms was between 11 and 16 days. Altogether 21,665 isolation days were observed in four hospitals; this means 1.52% of all patient days. On average, 9.0% of roommates were identified as MRSA carriers. Due to the high percentage of imported cases, the four university hospitals introduced a general screening for MRSA at admission in all ICUs and some further departments as well as an automatic alert system for readmitted patient with MRSA during their last hospital stay."
