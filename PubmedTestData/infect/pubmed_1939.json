        "The role that colonization with Mycobacterium avium plays in the development of disseminated disease is unclear. In this study, we determined whether all M. avium strains isolated from the portals of M. avium infection are capable of crossing the mucosal border and causing infection. The patients in this study were enrolled in AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocol 341. The patients were divided into 3 groups; 2 groups differed in their immunological and clinical risk for M. avium disease. A third group (n=22 patients) had culture-documented disseminated M. avium complex disease at the time of entry in the study. Eight of 22 patients had M. avium isolated from both a colonized site and blood or bone marrow specimens. All 8 patients had distinct M. avium strains; 2 patients had a polyclonal infection. The virulence properties of 13 strains were determined, including invasion of gastrointestinal cells and replication in macrophages. There were significant differences in the virulence properties, and these differences may provide insight into the interplay between microbial pathogenesis and host defense."
