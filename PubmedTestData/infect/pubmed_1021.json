        "Twelve-week-old specific-pathogen-free pigs were inoculated deep in the bronchi with Haemophilus (Actinobacillus) pleuropneumoniae strain 13261 in doses ranging from 8 x 10(1) to 9 x 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU). Pigs that survived infection were euthanatized and examined 48 hours after inoculation. The relationship between dose and severity of disease was evaluated clinically and the weight of pneumonic lesions was compared. The relationship between infection dose and weight of pneumonic lesions proved to be unimodal and not linear. Inoculation of 10(4) CFU of strain 13261 resulted in severe pneumonic lesions and mortality of 29%. In contrast, death was not observed after inoculation with 10(6) CFU of strain 13261 and pneumonic lesions were less severe (P less than 0.05). An infective dose of 10(3) CFU induced pneumonic lesions that tended (not statistically significant) to be less severe than those induced by a dose of 10(4) CFU. The peak fever response in all infected pigs was observed from 6 to 12 hours after inoculation. Leukocytosis developed within 12 hours after inoculation, because of an increase of neutrophilic granulocytes. Thereafter, WBC count decreased owing to lymphopenia. Serum iron concentration decreased 80% after inoculation, and zinc concentration decreased 54%."
