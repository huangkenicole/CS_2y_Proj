        "The purpose of study is to explore markers of persistent herpes viral infections in children with inflammatory processes of upper respiratory ways and ENT-organs. The sampling included 118 examined patients aged from 1 month to 17 years. The complex of standardized viral, immunological, molecular genetic methods was applied to detect (to exclude) herpes infection: cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barre virus infection, simplex herpes virus infection. The diagnostic algorithm of examination of children with diseases of upper respiratory ways for herpes infection is presented. The dominating significance of simplex herpes virus and Epstein-Barre virus and also Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus haemolyticus-\u03b2 group A at the analysis of microbial landscape. In 83.9% of children with diseases of upper respiratory ways chronic infections of simplex herpes virus, Epstein-Barre virus, cytomegalovirus; in39.39% - mixed-infection; in 41.03% - combination of simplex herpes virus and Epstein-Barre virus infections; in 33.33% - combination of simplex herpes virus and cytomegalovirus infections; in 7.69% - combination of simplex herpes virus and Epstein-Barre virus and cytomegalovirus infections; in 17.94% - combination of Epstein-Barre virus and cytomegalovirus infections; The particularity of course of persistent herpes infection in children had to do with absence of specific symptoms of nosologic form in 59.2% of cases. The results of analysis of smears from nasopharynx of children infected with herpes viruses permitted to detect: Staphylococcus aureus in 36.36%; Streptococcus haemolyticus-\u03b2 in 32.32%; Streptococcus haemolyticus-\u03b1 in 11.11%; Candida albicans of mucous membranes in 4.04% of children. The viral bacterial mixed-infection was detected in 44.44%. The laboratory signs of activity of immune inflammation were detected: increasing of content of TN\u0410\u03b1 and decreasing of level of IFN\u03b3. The results of study substantiate necessity of individual approach to therapy of children with diseases of upper respiratory ways and ENT-organs and with implementation of complex of curative rehabilitating activities.The purpose of study is to explore markers of persistent herpes viral infections in children with inflammatory processes of upper respiratory ways and ENT-organs.
