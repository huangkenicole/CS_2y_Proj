        "Cefoxitin was administered intravenously to 143 patients, 67% of whom were seriously ill. The rate of cure or improvement was 93%. The study was conducted in two phases; the first was an open, controlled clinical comparison of cefoxitin and cephalothin. In this phase, 28 patients received cefoxitin and 29 received cephalothin. In the second phase, cefoxitin alone was used for the treatment of an additional 115 patients. Twenty bacteremic patients treated with cefoxitin were cured or improved in 95% of cases. The infecting organism was eradicated in all bacteremic patients. All of 14 anaerobic or predominantly anaerobic infections were cured or improved. The infecting anaerobic organism was eliminated in 86% of the cases. Twenty-five patients infected by cephalothin-resistant, cefoxitin-susceptible gram-negative rods were cured. Three patients each with infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis were cured. The incidence of adverse experiences was: 1.4% drug eruption; 2% each asymptomatic serum transaminase elevation and leukopenia; and 2.5% asymptomatic eosinophilia. The incidence of severe thrombophlebitis was 5%. No permanent or serious adverse reactions were encountered. Although the numbers of patients in some categories were too small to permit statistical evaluation, I feel that cefoxitin may be a useful new antibiotic for treatment of infections caused by cehalothin-resistant bacteria and by anaerobic organisms."
