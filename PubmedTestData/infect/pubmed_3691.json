        "The objective of this study was to determine the amount and infectivity of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) shed in nasal, oral and fecal secretions following experimental infection. Fecal, oral and nasal swabs and blood were collected at regular intervals until 69 days post-inoculation (DPI) from five PCV2-experimentally inoculated pigs (Trial 1). To assess the infectivity of the PCV2 present in excretions, secretions, and on a hypodermic needle, 26 PCV2-na\u00efve pigs (Trial 2) were inoculated with various samples obtained from Trial 1 pigs. In Trial 1, PCV2 DNA was detected in all sample types by 69 DPI. There were no differences in the amount of PCV2 DNA present in different sample types over time. In Trial 2, intraperitoneal inoculation with contaminated fecal, nasal and oral samples; intranasal inoculation of nasal secretions; and feces fed to na\u00efve animals resulted in viremia and seroconversion. Viremia and microscopic lesions were noted in one animal injected using a contaminated needle. In conclusion, experimental PCV2 exposure results in a long term infection. PCV2 is shed in similar amounts by nasal, oral and fecal routes and is infectious to na\u00efve pigs confirming that multiple routes of transmission are likely important in spread of PCV2 between pigs."
