      "AbstractText": [
        "A disseminated and progressive infection, penicilliosis marneffei is the third most common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in certain parts of Southeast Asia. Penicillium marneffei is endemic in Southeast Asia and the southern part of China. Cases have been reported from both Eastern and Western countries. This review discusses the history, epidemiology, mycology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of penicilliosis marneffei, on the basis of 155 cases of the infection. About 80% of the patients are immunocompromised. P. marneffei can infect various organs, particularly the lung, liver, and skin. The most common clinical features include fever, weight loss, and anemia. The organism has been isolated most commonly from skin, blood, and bone marrow. Immunologic identification of fungal isolates can be done with exoantigen tests and immunohistochemical methods. Treatment of disseminated penicilliosis marneffei in HIV-infected patients with parenteral amphotericin B and itraconazole is relatively effective and safe."
